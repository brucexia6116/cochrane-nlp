ABSTRACT
Background The optimal duration of zidovudine administration to prevent perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) should be
determined to facilitate its use in areas where resources are limited.
Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind
equivalence trial of four regimens of zidovudine starting in the mother at 28 weeks’ gestation, with 6 weeks
of treatment in the infant (the long–long regimen),
which is similar to protocol 076; zidovudine starting at
35 weeks’ gestation, with 3 days of treatment in the
infant (the short–short regimen); a long–short regimen; and a short–long regimen. The mothers received
zidovudine orally during labor. The infants were fed
formula and were tested for HIV DNA at 1, 45, 120, and
180 days. After the first interim analysis, the short–
short regimen was stopped.
Results A total of <n>1437</n> women were enrolled. At the
first interim analysis, the rates of HIV transmission
were 4.1 percent for the long–long regimen and 10.5
percent for the short–short regimen (P=0.004); at this
point the short–short regimen was stopped. For the
entire study period, the transmission rates were 6.5
percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.1 to 8.9 percent) for the long–long regimen, 4.7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 7.0 percent) for the
long–short regimen, and 8.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.6 to 11.6 percent) for the short–long
regimen. The rate of in utero transmission was significantly higher with the two regimens with shorter maternal treatment (5.1 percent) than with the two with
longer maternal treatment (1.6 percent).
Conclusions The short–short zidovudine regimen is
inferior to the long–long regimen and leads to a higher rate of perinatal HIV transmission. The long–short,
short–long, and long–long regimens had equivalent
efficacy. However, the higher rate of in utero transmission with the short–long regimen suggests that longer
treatment of the infant cannot substitute for longer
treatment of the mother. (N Engl J Med 2000;343:

A

STUDY conducted by the Pediatric AIDS
Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) has shown
that zidovudine is effective in preventing
transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from mother to child.1 In this trial (protocol 076), women were given oral zidovudine
between 14 and 34 weeks’ gestation (median duration
of treatment, 11 weeks). They also received zidovudine intravenously during labor. The newborns received zidovudine for six weeks and were fed formula.
The rate of HIV transmission was reduced from 22.6
percent to 7.6 percent.2 Subsequent studies have confirmed the efficacy of perinatal prophylaxis with zidovudine.3,4
To determine whether the efficacy of a shortened
regimen would be equivalent to that of protocol 076,
we conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing four zidovudine regimens of varying duration
in mothers and infants. The results of the first interim analysis led to the discontinuation of the shortest
regimen and modification of the study design.5 We
report the results of an intention-to-treat analysis for
the period before the modification of the study design and for the overall study.

METHODS
Trial Design
The purpose of our trial was to compare the efficacy and safety
of a zidovudine regimen that resembled protocol 076 (maternal
treatment starting at 28 weeks’ gestation and 6 weeks of postnatal
treatment in the infant) with the efficacy and safety of a shortened
regimen in mothers and infants (maternal treatment starting at 35
weeks’ gestation and 3 days of postnatal treatment in the infant). To
determine which of the two modifications of the PACTG 076 protocol — a shorter regimen in the mother or a shorter regimen in
the infant — was more important, should equivalence between
protocol 076 and the shortened regimens be rejected, we added two
intermediate regimens according to a two-by-two factorial design:
a regimen shortened only for the mother and a regimen shortened
only for the infant.
Women were randomly assigned to one of four groups. The
long–long group received zidovudine from 28 weeks’ gestation
through delivery, with zidovudine administered in the infant from
birth through week 6. The short–short group received placebo
starting at 28 weeks’ gestation and then received zidovudine from
35 weeks’ gestation through delivery, with the infant receiving zidovudine for the first 3 days of life, followed by placebo through
week 6. The long–short group received zidovudine from 28 weeks’
gestation through delivery, with the infant receiving zidovudine
for the first 3 days of life, followed by placebo through week 6.
The short–long group received placebo starting at 28 weeks’ gestation, followed by zidovudine from 35 weeks’ gestation through
delivery, with the infant receiving zidovudine from birth through
week 6. In all groups, the women received oral zidovudine every
three hours during labor.
After the first interim analysis, the short–short regimen was discontinued, and the study was redesigned to test for equivalence between the efficacy of the long–long regimen and the efficacy of the
other two regimens. The randomization scheme was modified to
ensure adequate statistical power.
The initial protocol and its amendments were approved by the
ethics committees of the Thai Ministry of Public Health, Chiang
Mai University, and the Harvard School of Public Health. All study
sites complied with regulations of the Department of Health and
Human Services for the protection of research subjects.
Patients
Women presenting at any of 27 Thai study sites before 26 weeks’
gestation received counseling about HIV infection, and those who
provided consent underwent HIV testing. Pre-enrollment studies
included confirmation of the results of the HIV test, history taking and physical examination, ultrasonographic imaging, measurement of hemoglobin, white-cell and differential counts, a CD4
count, and measurements of serum alanine aminotransferase and
creatinine.
Women were enrolled at 28 weeks’ gestation if they provided
written informed consent and agreed not to breast-feed and if the
following criteria were met within 21 days before randomization:
hemoglobin level, higher than 8.0 g per deciliter; absolute neutrophil count, more than 750 per cubic millimeter; serum alanine
aminotransferase level, less than five times the upper limit of normal; and creatinine level, less than 1.5 mg per deciliter (132.6 µmol
per liter). The exclusion criteria were a maternal or fetal condition
or concomitant treatment contraindicating treatment with zidovudine, oligohydramnios, unexplained hydramnios, and in utero anemia. Women with a CD4 count of less than 200 per cubic millimeter were offered trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis.
Women who did not meet the inclusion criteria were offered openlabel zidovudine.6
Treatment and Evaluation
During pregnancy, the women received one 300-mg tablet of
zidovudine twice daily. One 300-mg zidovudine tablet was taken
at the onset of labor and every three hours thereafter until deliv-

ery. If oral medication was not tolerated, zidovudine was administered intravenously.1 The women were monitored at 32, 35, 38,
and 40 weeks’ gestation, every week thereafter until delivery, and
6 weeks and 18 months after delivery.
The infants received 2 mg of zidovudine per kilogram of body
weight orally every six hours. If an infant could not tolerate oral
fluids, zidovudine was administered intravenously.1 Twins were assigned the same study regimen. Evaluation of the infants at birth
included physical examination and measurement of hemoglobin,
neutrophil count, serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, and
serum bilirubin. Treatment was started as soon as the infant could
tolerate fluids, except when zidovudine was contraindicated or the
infant had a clinical condition that was expected to be fatal. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was given to the infants from the
age of six weeks until their HIV status could be confirmed.
The infants were evaluated 2, 4, and 6 weeks after birth; at 4 and
6 months; and then every 3 months until they were 18 months old.
Peripheral blood obtained at birth, 6 weeks, and 4 and 6 months
was spotted onto filter papers, dried, and stored at ¡20°C to await
shipping to the New England Newborn Screening Program for testing with a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) DNA assay for HIV
(Prototype Amplicor HIV-1 DNA, version 1.5, Roche Molecular
Systems, Alameda, Calif.).7 HIV-infected, symptomatic infants were
given antiretroviral therapy supplied by the Thai Ministry of Public Health.
Compliance with treatment was assessed by counting pills and
weighing oral-suspension bottles. Serious adverse events were
reported to the Thai Ministry of Public Health and to Glaxo
Wellcome.8
Randomization and Blinding
The study drugs, packaged by Glaxo Wellcome, were identified
by random numbers with the use of permuted blocks of six in a
ratio of 2:1:1:2 for the long–long, short–long, long–short, and
short–short groups, respectively. After the first interim analysis,
new supplies were provided in blocks of five, with a new randomization scheme in a ratio of 1:2:2 for the long–long, long–short,
and short–long groups, respectively.
Primary End Point
Infants were considered to be infected with HIV if the results
of the PCR test were positive for blood samples obtained on two
separate occasions, and infants were considered to be uninfected
if the test results were negative on two occasions after one month
of age. Infants were considered to have been infected in utero if
the first positive test result was obtained within seven days after
birth.9 Twins were considered a single entity for the purpose of
the primary end point; discordant twins were counted as one infected infant.
Statistical Analysis
Because the reference treatment in this study was a regimen of
established efficacy, we tested for equivalent efficacy of the experimental treatments, choosing a threshold for equivalence that would
balance public health concerns with clinical benefits. Using a costeffectiveness approach, we determined that an absolute increase
of 6 percent in the rate of transmission of HIV infection would be
the limit beyond which the clinical risk associated with the experimental treatment would not be balanced by its economic and logistical advantages.
With this criterion for equivalence, we calculated that a sample
of 1398 mother–infant pairs would be required to provide more
than 90 percent statistical power with a 5 percent one-sided type I
error and an 11 percent overall transmission rate. Equivalence
would be established if the upper limit of the one-sided 95 percent
confidence interval for the arithmetic difference in the percentage
rates of HIV transmission was less than 6.10,11
Interim safety analyses were planned when 40 and 70 percent
of the total number of women had been enrolled. An increased
rate of HIV transmission associated with the shorter regimens, as

The Ne w E n g l a nd Jo u r n a l o f Me d ic i ne

compared with the long–long regimen, would be considered significant if any of the nominal P values for the differences were less
than 0.007 in the first interim analysis and less than 0.012 in the
second (with the use of one-sided tests with Bonferroni’s adjustment for multiple comparisons).12
Two separate analyses were conducted: a comparison of the
short–short and long–long groups, including all mother–infant
pairs enrolled before December 4, 1998 (without unblinding), and
the final analysis of the equivalence of the long–long regimen
with the long–short and short–long regimens, with stratification
according to the study period (before or after the randomization
scheme was modified). Some of the 87 women enrolled in the
short–short group on or after December 4, 1998, had not delivered when the results of the first interim analysis became available,
in March 1999. The treatment assignments for these women were
unblinded to ensure that their infants received the long regimen.
To avoid any bias, none of these 87 women were included in the
efficacy analyses. The date by which all infants had completed drug
treatment, May 31, 2000, was chosen as the cutoff date for the
analysis of adverse events. Characteristics of the mother, the infant, and the delivery were compared among the treatment groups
with the use of the chi-square and Kruskal–Wallis tests, with the
data stratified according to the enrollment period when appropriate. Because clinical trials of short zidovudine regimens have generally started treatment at 36 weeks’ gestation,13 subgroup analyses were performed for women who delivered before 36 weeks’
gestation and for those who delivered at or after 36 weeks’ gestation.
The Kaplan–Meier method and Greenwood’s formula were
used to estimate transmission rates and their standard errors. The
comparison of efficacy between treatment groups was based on
the 95 percent one-sided confidence interval for the difference in
the percentage of infected infants at six months. P values were determined from Z statistics, which were calculated from the differences between Kaplan–Meier estimates at six months and their
standard errors. Because of the change in the randomization
scheme, we used stratification and weighting to avoid any bias
due to temporal trends. A common set of weights was calculated
on the basis of the fraction of subjects in each randomization period. For each treatment group, estimates of HIV transmission
rates according to the randomization period were averaged with
use of these weights to obtain an overall estimate. The time to
the first positive HIV test was considered the time to the end point.
Data from infants with unconfirmed negative tests were censored
at the time of the last confirmed negative test.
All analyses were performed according to the intention-totreat principle. Except for the results of the efficacy analysis, all
reported P values are two-sided, without adjustment for multiple
testing.

RESULTS

From June 24, 1997, to December 3, 1999, 1437
women were randomly assigned to a treatment group
(1114 assigned to the long–long, long–short, or
short–long group; 236 assigned to the short–short
group before December 4, 1998; and 87 assigned to
the short–short group on or after December 4, 1998,
and excluded from the analyses of efficacy). Data on
treatment assignments, loss to follow-up, and the
outcomes of pregnancy are summarized in Figure 1.
A total of 1411 women (98.2 percent) were followed
through delivery. Data on end points were available
for 99.5 percent of the 1409 live-born infants.
Characteristics of the Women and Infants

The base-line characteristics of the women included in the efficacy analysis were similar among the treat984 ·

ment groups (Table 1). Eleven percent of the women were under 20 years of age, and 17 percent were
over 30; 58.1 percent were primiparous. The median
length of gestation at enrollment was 27.9 weeks;
the length of gestation was more than 29 weeks in
4.5 percent of the women. The body-mass index
(the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the
height in meters) was less than 20 in 6.0 percent of
the women. At enrollment, 90.3 percent of the women had no symptoms of HIV infection or AIDS. None
of the women had received antiretroviral drugs.
The groups did not differ significantly with regard
to treatment characteristics (Table 1). A total of 97.7
percent of the women attended all scheduled antenatal visits, and 93.0 percent took more than 80 percent of the prescribed dose of the study drug. The
median duration of labor was 8.2 hours. The median
time from the onset of labor to the first dose of zidovudine taken during labor was 0.5 hour. Three percent of the women received an intravenous loading
dose of zidovudine during labor.
The characteristics of delivery were similar among
the groups (Table 1). The median length of gestation
was 39.1 weeks; 4.9 percent of the women delivered
before 36 weeks’ gestation. The median interval between rupture of the membranes and delivery was
0.7 hour. Fifty-six percent of cesarean sections were
performed on an emergency basis, and 44 percent
were elective; 3 percent were performed before the
onset of labor. Prevention of perinatal HIV infection
was not reported as an indication for cesarean section.
The characteristics of the infants were also similar
among the treatment groups (Table 1). The median
gestational age at birth (Ballard fetal-maturation score)
was 40 weeks; 4.3 percent of the infants had a score
of less than 37 weeks. The time from birth to the
administration of the first dose of zidovudine in the
infant was similar in all the groups (median, 1.4 hours);
0.8 percent of the newborns received intravenous zidovudine. There was one report of breast-feeding by
the mother.
Women enrolled later in the study had lower CD4
counts than those enrolled earlier (P=0.003, data
not shown). None of the other characteristics of the
mothers, infants, or deliveries differed significantly according to the time of enrollment.
Analysis of Efficacy

The rates of HIV transmission among the women
assigned to the long–long group and those assigned
to the short–short group before December 4, 1998,
confirmed the results of the interim analysis: 4.1 percent in the long–long group (95 percent confidence
interval, 1.4 to 6.7 percent) and 10.5 percent in the
short–short group (95 percent confidence interval,
6.4 to 14.4 percent; P=0.004). Among the women
who delivered before 36 weeks’ gestation, the transmission rates were 13.3 percent (95 percent confi-

weeks’ gestation, the respective rates were 3.4 percent
(95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 5.9 percent)

of equivalence, the efficacy of the short–long regimen and that of the long–short regimen were statistically equivalent to the efficacy of the long–long
regimen.
An unstratified analysis showed that at six months,
the rates of HIV transmission or death were 7.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.9 to 10.2 percent), 5.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval,
3.1 to 8.0 percent), and 8.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.8 to 11.9 percent) in the long–long,
long–short, and short–long groups, respectively (Table 2). In the analysis stratified according to the randomization period, the respective rates were 9.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.6 to 12.6

‡The data were stratified according to the time of enrollment (before or after the randomization scheme was changed). Before the randomization scheme was changed, 312, 156, and 151 women were enrolled
in the long–long, long–short, and short–long groups, respectively, and the respective transmission rates were 5.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 7.6 percent), 5.2 percent (95 percent confidence
interval, 1.6 to 8.6 percent), and 8.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 13.0 percent). After the change in the randomization scheme, 89, 184, and 187 women were enrolled in the long–long, long–
short, and short–long groups, respectively, and the respective transmission rates were 11.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 17.6 percent), 4.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 7.3 percent),
and 8.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.5 to 12.5 percent). For the final analysis, the weights used were the fraction of the total number of women in each enrollment period (0.574 before the change
in the randomization scheme and 0.426 after the change).

†P values were calculated by one-sided testing for the difference in rates between the shortened regimen and the long–long regimen.

*Numbers in parentheses are 95 percent confidence intervals. Differences in rates are arithmetic differences in the point estimates between the shortened regimens and the long–long regimen. All the patients
enrolled in the long–long group before December 4, 1998, were included in the final analysis. The efficacy of a shortened regimen was considered to be equivalent to that of the long–long regimen if the upper
limit of the 95 percent confidence interval for the arithmetic difference in the percentage rates of transmission was less than 6.

3.2 to 8.4 percent), and 9.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6.0 to 12.4 percent).
In a stratified analysis of pooled data for the two
groups in which the women received the long regimen of zidovudine (the long–long and long–short
groups) and for the two groups in which the women received the short regimen (the short–short and
short–long groups), the respective rates of transmission in utero were 1.6 percent (95 percent confidence
interval, 0.7 to 2.6 percent) for the long maternal
regimen and 5.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.2 to 7.0 percent) for the short maternal regimen (P<0.001). The rates were identical in the unstratified analysis.
Safety

None of the women discontinued the study treatment because of intolerance or toxicity. Differences
in the hemoglobin level between the women who
received the long zidovudine regimen and those who
received the short regimen were as expected (Table 1).
The rate of serious adverse events was similar in the
two groups of women (Table 3). All cases of severe
anemia and neutropenia resolved spontaneously after completion of the treatment regimen.
As expected, the hemoglobin level at birth was
significantly lower in the infants of mothers who received the long regimen of zidovudine than in the infants of mothers who received the short regimen, and
the postnatal fall in the hemoglobin level was slightly greater in the infants treated for six weeks than in
those treated for three days. The rate of serious adverse events was similar in all four groups of infants.
The Kaplan–Meier estimate of the mortality rate at
12 months for all four groups combined was 16.2
deaths per 1000 infants. When HIV-infected infants
were excluded, the rate was 8.0 deaths per 1000.
DISCUSSION

The reference treatment in this study (the long–
long regimen) was a simplified version of PACTG protocol 076 (300 mg of zidovudine twice a day instead
of 100 mg five times a day, with oral rather than intravenous administration during labor). Our regimen
provided an average of 11 weeks of maternal treatment before delivery plus 6 weeks of treatment in
the infant after birth — a duration of treatment that
was virtually identical to that in the PACTG trial. The
regimen we used is simpler and less costly ($174)
than the 076 regimen ($800).13 The rate of HIV
transmission from mother to child in the long–long
group in our study (6.5 percent) is similar to that in
the PACTG study of protocol 076 and in all subsequent studies of this regimen, confirming the appropriateness of using protocol 076 as the reference regimen.14
All the regimens were well tolerated in our study,
and compliance was excellent. This was true even for
988 ·

the initial doses of zidovudine administered during
labor, which the women took at home. The study was
performed at 27 hospitals, including many rural and
several large provincial hospitals, all of which were
able to comply with all the study procedures.6 Formula feeding did not appear to affect the safety of
the infants. The mortality rate was low among the
infants (16.2 deaths per 1000 overall, and 8.0 per 1000
after the exclusion of HIV-infected infants).
The analysis of women enrolled before December 4,
1998, confirmed that the short–short regimen was
less efficacious than the long–long regimen (transmission rate, 10.5 percent vs. 4.1 percent). The short–
short regimen in our study was similar to the regimen
used in a study in Bangkok, Thailand, with treatment
started at 36 weeks’ gestation, although in that study,
the infants received no treatment.13 The rate of transmission in the Bangkok study was 9.6 percent, but
only women who delivered after 36 weeks were included. In our study, the rate of transmission was 9.1
percent for the women who delivered at or after 36
weeks, whereas it was 43.8 percent for those who delivered earlier. If a policy of treating women with the
short zidovudine regimen were adopted, the actual
transmission rate would probably be higher than 9.1
percent, since women delivering before 36 weeks’ gestation would not receive the drug.
After discontinuing the short–short regimen, we
modified the study design to determine whether the
efficacy of the long–short regimen and the efficacy
of the short–long regimen were equivalent to that of
the long–long regimen. The primary analysis showed
that the transmission rates in the long–short and
short–long groups were statistically equivalent to the
rate in the long–long group. A closer examination
of the data provided further important insights. The
primary analysis and all secondary analyses confirmed
that the efficacy of the long–short regimen was equivalent to that of the long–long regimen. Thus, if women receive zidovudine starting at 28 weeks’ gestation,
treatment of infants for more than 3 days after birth
appears to be unnecessary.
The rate of transmission in the short–long group
was almost midway between the rate in the short–
short group and the rates in the long–long and long–
short groups. Indeed, unlike the strict equivalence of
rates in the long–short and long–long groups, the
equivalence of rates in the short–long and long–long
groups was marginal; the upper limit of the 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between
the rates in the two groups was 5.3 percent (close to
the boundary of 6.0 percent). This finding suggests
an interaction between treatments in the mothers and
the infants. A long regimen in the infant, which appears unnecessary when the mother starts zidovudine
treatment early in pregnancy, may be beneficial if the
mother starts to take zidovudine late in pregnancy.
This finding is consistent with observational data in-

*Serious adverse events, defined according to the Good Clinical Practice guidelines,8 were reported
immediately to the Thai Ministry of Public Health and the Department of International Product
Safety and Pharmacovigilance at Glaxo Wellcome. Events were reported during pregnancy and for
the first six months post partum for the mothers and during the first six months of life for the infants.
In the case of twins, only the first twin was included in the analysis.
†All 11 maternal deaths occurred after delivery. Five women died from pneumonia, two from sepsis,
one from cryptococcal meningitis, and one from an AIDS-defining event; two deaths were suicides.
‡Seven infants died from recurrent infections, four from severe prematurity, three from neonatal
events, two from AIDS, one from anemia and pneumonia at 10 weeks, one from tuberculosis, one
from congenital diaphragmatic hernia and patent ductus arteriosus, one from an accidental injury,
and one from neonatal asphyxia due to a cleft palate.
§There were 24 congenital abnormalities in 21 infants; 5 infants had a ventricular septal defect,
4 had polydactyly, 3 had a cleft lip or cleft palate or both, 3 had congenital heart disease, 2 had
Down’s syndrome, 2 had monorchidism, 1 had a diaphragmatic hernia, 1 had omphalocele, 1 had
hydrocephalus, 1 had microcephaly, and 1 had a microcornea.
¶All episodes of neutropenia and leukopenia resolved spontaneously without complications.

dicating that six weeks of treatment in the infant was
beneficial when the mother received little or no treatment.4 Since the short–short regimen was terminated
early, our study did not have sufficient power to test
the difference in efficacy between the long and short
regimens in the infants of women who received the
short regimen.
The transmission rate in the short–short group
was between the rate in the long–long group and
the rates in placebo groups in earlier trials. It also was
similar to the rates reported with other shortened
regimens of zidovudine, with or without lamivudine,
in women in Thailand and Africa.15
The benefit of giving pregnant women longer treatment was unequivocally established by our finding that

the rate of in utero transmission was lower in the
combined groups in which the women received the
long regimen (1.6 percent) than in the combined
groups in which the women received the short regimen (5.1 percent). The extent of suppression of in
utero transmission depends on the duration of antiretroviral treatment during the later part of pregnancy. We suggest that to improve prevention programs
that currently use a short course of zidovudine, the
best option would be to implement the long–short
regimen. The seven additional weeks of maternal treatment will prevent an important fraction of in utero
transmissions and at a minimal extra cost, given that
most women will have already received counseling
and undergone HIV testing. If maternal treatment

treatment of the infant for 6 weeks should be considered.
In industrialized countries, planned cesarean section and combination therapies available to women
have reduced the overall rate of HIV transmission to
less than 2 percent.15 Widespread implementation of
these approaches is not yet feasible in countries with
limited resources. Since transmission during delivery
accounts for most cases of HIV infection among the
infants of women treated prenatally with a long regimen of zidovudine, similarly low transmission rates
may be achieved at low cost by administering a potent antiretroviral drug, such as a single dose of nevirapine, at the onset of labor.16
