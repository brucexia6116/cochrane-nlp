Abstract
Objectives. Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is a pleiotropic cytokine with antiproliferative, immunostimulatory, and chemosensitization properties. This trial
was designed to evaluate IFN-γ 1b plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in treatment-naive ovarian cancer (OC) and primary peritoneal carcinoma (PPC) patients.
Methods. Eligible patients were randomized to 6 cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel every 3 weeks or the same in combination with IFN-γ 1b
(100 µg 3×/wk subcutaneously). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) time (target hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77). Secondary endpoints
included progression-free survival (target HR = 0.7), based on blinded review of serial imaging scans, physical exams, and CA-125 levels.
Results. <n>847</n> patients were enrolled (OC 774, PPC 73) in Europe (n = 539) and North/South America (n = 308) from January 29, 2002 to March
31, 2004 and stratified according to: optimal debulking (n = 271) versus suboptimal debulking with plans for interval debulking (PID) (n = 238) or
no PID (n = 338). The study stopped early following a protocol-defined second interim analysis which revealed significantly shorter OS time in
patients receiving IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone (1138 days vs. not estimable, HR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.15–1.83).
At the time of the analysis, 169 of 426 (39.7%) patients in the IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy group had died compared to 128 of 421 (30.4%) in the
chemotherapy alone group. Serious adverse events were more common in the IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy group (48.5% vs. 35.4%), primarily
due to a higher incidence of serious hematological toxicities (34.5% vs. 22.7%).
Conclusions. Treatment with IFN-γ 1b in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel does not have a role in the first-line treatment of advanced
ovarian cancer.

Background
In the United States, ovarian cancer is the leading cause
of death from gynecologic malignancies [1]. In 2007, it is
estimated that there were 22,430 new ovarian cancers diagnosed
and 15,286 deaths from this disease [1]. Over 70% of ovarian
cancer patients have advanced stage disease (FIGO Stage III or
IV) at the time of diagnosis [1]. Because of decreased toxicity
and the ability to administer the regimen as an out-patient
infusion, carboplatin plus paclitaxel is used as the initial standard
chemotherapy regimen to treat more than 80% of suboptimally
debulked stage III and IV, disease [2]. The success of this
combination has been documented in two large phase III trials in
the U.S. and Europe [3,4]. Although an objective response rate
to platinum-taxane based chemotherapy of over 70% can be
anticipated, ovarian cancer tends to recur, even in patients who
achieve a complete response; the estimated 5-year survival for
patients with Stage III and IV disease is less than 40% [1,3].
Therefore, the development of more effective primary therapy
for advanced ovarian cancer represents a critical need.
IFN-γ, which is produced by activated T cells and natural
killer (NK) cells, has pleiotropic immunologic effects and exerts
anti-proliferative effects on ovarian cancer cells in-vitro, especially when combined with cisplatin [5–8]. Clinical evidence for
activity of IFN-γ 1b for the treatment of ovarian cancer was
initially suggested in 1988 by Welander et al., who treated 14
patients with relapsing ovarian cancer with IFN-γ 1b (2 mg/m2
daily intravenously) and observed a response in 4 patients (29%)
[9]. While early trials in limited numbers of patients yielded
contradictory results, Pujade-Lauraine et al., reported an overall
response rate of 31% in a series of 108 patients with residual
disease at second-look laparotomy treated with intraperitoneal
IFN-γ 1b [10].
Windbichler et al. performed a prospective randomized,
multicenter trial of chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy
plus IFN-γ 1b to evaluate its efficacy in first-line therapy of
ovarian cancer [11]. 148 patients with FIGO Stage IC–III
disease or Stage IV disease due to pleural effusion only were
randomized to either chemotherapy consisting of 6 cycles of
cisplatin and cyclophosphamide (which was the standard of care
in 1991) or chemotherapy plus IFN-γ 1b 100 µg s.c. three times
weekly every other week [11]. Randomization was terminated
before the planned number of 200 patients was reached, due
to changes in the standard of care chemotherapy for first-line
treatment of ovarian cancer. Progression-free survival (PFS)
(median follow-up of 24 months) at 3 years was improved from
38% in the control group to 51% in the treatment group, corresponding to median times to progression of 17 and 48 months
(RR of progression = 0.48, 95% CI 0.28–0.82). Three-year OS
(median follow-up of 29 months) were 58% and 74%, respectively (P = NS, median not reached). Toxicity was comparable in
both groups except for a mild flu-like syndrome experienced
after administration of IFN-γ 1b [12].
In advance of the current phase III trial, Marth et al. conducted
a Phase I/II trial of IFN-γ 1b in combination with carboplatin
(AUC5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion) in
patients with newly diagnosed FIGO Stage III/IV epithelial

175

ovarian cancer. [13]. Thirty-four patients were treated with increasing doses of IFN-γ 1b (25 µg to 100 µg s.c. 3 times each
week) and dose-limiting toxicity was not observed; however, 74%
of the patients had grade 3/4 neutropenia. The overall response
rate was 72% (i.e. clinical complete response in 54% and partial
response in 18%). The authors concluded that IFN-γ 1b is safe in
combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel for the first-line
treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer, and suggested
that the combination should be further evaluated as an
immunotherapeutic treatment option for ovarian cancer.
Based on the above evidence we performed a phase III trial
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IFN-γ 1b in combination
with carboplatin/paclitaxel for the first-line therapy of advanced
ovarian and primary peritoneal carcinoma.
Methods
Patient population
Eligible patients were previously untreated females with histologically
confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer or PPC and FIGO stage III or IV disease
with either optimal (≤1 cm residual disease) or suboptimal residual disease
following initial surgery who provided informed consent between January 29,
2002 and March 31, 2004. Additional eligibility criteria included: randomization
within 12 weeks after initial surgery and ≤ 7 days between randomization and
first treatment dose; adequate bone marrow, hepatic (AST, ALT, and alkaline
phosphatase, bilirubin), and renal function; and ECOG performance score 0–2.

Study design
This was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, two-arm Phase III trial.
Patients were stratified by extent of residual disease (≤1 cm vs. N1 cm) and
intent to perform interval debulking surgery, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
receive chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus IFN-γ 1b. Chemotherapy
included paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over 3 h) followed by carboplatin (AUC 6)
every 3 weeks with or without IFN-γ 1b 100 µg administered subcutaneously, 3
times weekly (every other day; no more than 3 doses in a 7-day period)
continuously (including the 3 weeks following the last dose of chemotherapy). A
total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy were given unless disease progression or doselimiting toxicity occurred or patients refused further treatment. The primary
endpoint was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints included
progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment-failure-free survival (TFFS);
safety endpoints included the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic
adverse events or Grade 4 hematologic adverse events. Both non-hematologic
and hematologic adverse events were evaluated using NCI Common Toxicity
Criteria version 2.0.

Treatment modification
Subsequent cycles of therapy were not to begin until the ANC was ≥1500 cell/
mm3 (CTC grade 1) and the platelet count was ≥75,000 mm3 (CTC Grade1).
Therapy was delayed for a maximum of 2 weeks until these values were achieved.
There were no dose modifications for uncomplicated Grade 4 neutropenia defined
as neutropenia lasting b7 days. Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy ≥ Grade
2 required reduction of one dose level in paclitaxel (i.e. to 135 mg/m2) and delay in
subsequent therapy for a maximum of 2 weeks until recovered to ≤Grade 1.
Patients with ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy and patients who failed to recover
ANC or peripheral neuropathy adequately within a 2-week delay were to
discontinue protocol therapy immediately.

Efficacy assessments
Pelvic and rectovaginal exams were required at screening and as clinically
indicated. For patients with a palpable mass on pelvic or rectovaginal exam at

176

screening, physical examinations at all indicated time points included a pelvic
and rectovaginal exam. Imaging studies of the pelvis and abdomen (CT or MRI)
were required at screening, prior to cycle 4, after cycle 6 (or at the completion of
therapy, whichever came first), at 3 month intervals following treatment until
progression was noted, and/or as clinically indicated. Chest images (CT or X-ray)
were required at screening and after cycle 6 (or the completion of therapy,
whichever came first). If measurable disease was present in the chest at screening,
additional chest images were required prior to cycle 4, and at 3 month intervals
following therapy until progression was noted. Imaging studies were to be
conducted every 3 months for the first 2 years after the administration of the final
dose, every 6 months for the subsequent 2 years (years 3 and 4 post dosing), and
once per year beginning in the fifth year, until disease progression.
The following assessments were performed prior to the administration of
each subsequent cycle of chemotherapy and after the completion of the last cycle
of chemotherapy until progressive disease was documented: a problem-oriented
history, pelvic and rectovaginal exam (for patients with a palpable mass on
pelvic or rectovaginal exam at screening, or as clinically indicated), routine
clinical laboratory evaluations (CBC and differential, platelets, creatinine,
bilirubin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase) and Serum CA-125.
After the completion of the protocol assigned treatment, patients were
followed every 3 months until disease progression by focused history, physical
examination, CA-125, and imaging studies. Imaging studies were conduced
every 3 months for the first 2 years after the administration of the final dose,
every 6 months for the subsequent 2 years (years 3 and 4 after dosing), and once
per year beginning in the fifth year. All patients were to be followed until
approximately 8 years after the start of accrual. Disease progression was
assessed by an endpoint review committee blinded to the treatment assignment
using serial CT scans or MRIs (assessed by treatment-blinded central readers
using modified RECIST criteria), physical exams, and CA-125 levels.

Statistical methods
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS) time, defined as the
time (in days) from the date of randomization until death. Based on a sample size
of 800 patients, the study had 85% power to detect a 30% increase in OS time in
the IFN-γ 1b arm (45 vs. 58.5 months), using a two-sided type I error (α)
probability of 0.05. The statistical significance of the primary comparison of OS
time was determined in the intent to treat (ITT) population using the log-rank
test, stratified by the randomization stratification. The hazard ratio (HR) for
death in the chemotherapy alone arm compared with the IFN-γ 1b arm was used
to establish the magnitude of the effect, and the associated 95% confidence
interval was estimated from the Cox regression model.
The secondary efficacy variables included progression-free survival (PFS)
time and treatment-failure-free survival (TFFS) time. PFS time was defined as
the time (in days) from randomization until the earliest date of disease
progression, death, or censoring. Disease progression was assessed by the
Endpoint Review Committee (ERC) and defined as the appearance of one or
more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing lesions;
development of cytologically confirmed neoplastic pleural effusions or ascites;
and serial elevation of serum CA-125 [14]. It was estimated that 411 PFS events
would provide 85% power to detect a 43% increase in median PFS time in the
IFN-γ 1b arm (20 vs. 28.6 months) with a two-sided significance level of 0.01.
The primary analysis of PFS time was conducted after the occurrence of 411
PFS events using the statistical methods described for the primary efficacy
variable. Patients who survived without a progression event were censored at the
date of their most recent assessment.
TFFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the
earliest date of progressive disease, death, or the start of non-protocol carcinoma
treatment for any reason. Comparisons of TFFS time were conducted using the
log-rank test stratified by randomization stratification.
Descriptive statistics were used to calculate the number and percentage of
patients with hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events (AEs).
Treatment comparisons were conducted using the Cochran–Mantel–Hentzel
(CMH) test stratified by the randomization stratification.
For the primary efficacy endpoint of OS, three interim analyses were
planned at pre-specified intervals, defined as the occurrence of 130, 260 and 390
deaths. The analyses were performed in confidence by an independent Data and
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) using the Lan–Demets alpha-spending

principle and the O'Brien–Fleming group-sequential analysis boundaries
[15,16]. The two-tailed significance levels for testing the null hypothesis at
each interim were 0.00161, 0.00197, and 0.00221, respectively, which provided
an overall two-tailed Type I Error probability of 0.05. A futility analysis based
on the conditional probability of observing a positive statistically significant
difference between treatment groups at the final analysis was conducted at each
interim. A conditional probability of 0.10 was established as the threshold below
which the DSMB would consider a recommendation to terminate the study for
futility.

Results
Comparability of baseline patient characteristics
Demographic and baseline patient characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups. As shown in Table 1, 847
patients were enrolled (ovarian cancer 774; primary peritoneal
carcinoma 73; European participants, 539; North and South
America participants, 308). Patient stratification was as follows:
optimal surgical debulking (n = 271) versus suboptimal surgical
debulking with plans for interval debulking (n = 238) or no plans
for interval debulking (n = 338). Mean patient age In the ITT
population was 56.2 years in the IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy

group and 55.8 years in the chemotherapy alone group. The
majority of patients in the IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy and
chemotherapy alone groups were white (95.8% and 94.3%), had
ovarian cancer (91.3% and 91.4%), were FIGO Stage III (76.5%
and 76.7%), and had an ECOG status of 1 or 2 (56.1% and
54.2%). Compliance in both arms was good with 80.3% of
those in the IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy arm completing 5
cycles and 77.0% completing 6 cycles. In the chemotherapy
alone arm 85.7% completed 5 cycles and 83.1% completed 6
cycles.
Efficacy results
A protocol-defined second interim analysis conducted after
the occurrence of 297 primary events revealed a statistically
significant difference between the treatment groups that crossed

HR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.15–1.83) (Fig. 1). At the time of the
second interim analysis, 169 of 426 (39.7%) patients had died in
the IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy group compared to 128 of 421
(30.4%) patients in the chemotherapy alone group (Table 2).
Table 3 summarizes the data concerning deaths, categorized by
etiology (i.e. ovarian cancer vs. non-ovarian cancer deaths)
and timing relative to treatment (during treatment vs. posttreatment). Less than 2% of the deaths were of non-ovarian
origin or occurred during treatment in the two treatment arms. In
contrast to the OS data, PFS time was similar between the IFNγ 1b plus chemotherapy and the chemotherapy alone group
(409 vs. 414 days, p = 0.796).
A pre-specified analysis of mortality in patients who met the
pre-specified definition of treatment adherence (completing at
least 5 of the planned 6 cycles of chemotherapy) revealed that
fewer patients in the IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy group than
the chemotherapy alone group adhered to the treatment protocol
(336 of 426 or 79% vs. 361 of 421 or 86%) and the difference in
mortality observed between treatment groups in the ITT analysis was less pronounced in the treatment adherent population
(Table 4).

AEs were reported in nearly all patients in the IFN-γ 1b plus
chemotherapy (411/423; 97.2%) and chemotherapy alone (406/
418; 97.1%) groups (Table 5). Alopecia, neutropenia, nausea,
anemia, fatigue, myalgia, constipation, vomiting, abdominal pain,
pyrexia, paresthesia, and arthralgia were the most commonly
reported AEs (≥20% of patients in either treatment group). Severe
(Grade 3) toxicities were reported in 36.6% and 37.1% of patients
in the IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone
groups (Table 6). Life-threatening (Grade 4) AEs occurred in a
higher proportion of patients administered IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy than chemotherapy alone group, (29.6% and 21.3%), and
were primarily associated with a higher incidence of lifethreatening hematologic toxicities (24.6% and 17.0%) (Table 6).
The overall incidence of hematologic toxicities was higher in the
IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy group than chemotherapy alone
(68.8% vs. 60.3%) (Table 5). Hematopoetic growth factors were
required in 21.1% and 12.8% of patients in the IFN-γ 1b plus
chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone groups, respectively.
Neutropenia was the most commonly reported myelotoxicity
(53.7% and 41.6% of patients on IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy and
chemotherapy alone) (Table 5).

Serious adverse events (SAEs)
SAEs were more common in the IFN-γ 1b plus chemotherapy group than the chemotherapy alone group (48.5% vs.
35.4%), and were primarily due to a higher incidence of serious
hematologic toxicities (34.5% vs. 22.7%) (Table 7). Doselimiting SAEs were twice as common in the IFN-γ 1b plus
chemotherapy group than the chemotherapy alone group (18.9%
vs. 9.1%), with the most common being neutropenia (6.9% vs.
2.9%) (Table 8). The overall incidence of withdrawal from
therapy was higher in the IFN-γ 1b group than the chemotherapy
alone group (23.7% vs. 17.3%, data not shown). In the IFN-γ 1b
plus chemotherapy group, the incidence of withdrawal from
therapy was higher during the first 3 treatment cycles compared
to cycles 4 through 6 (15.4% vs. 7.1%). In the chemotherapy
alone group, the incidence of withdrawal was only slightly
higher during the first 3 cycles compared to cycles 4 through 6
(9.3% vs. 6.9%).
Discussion
The scientific basis for this trial was derived from both in-vitro
preclinical and clinical data which indicated that IFN-γ 1b may be
a feasible and positive addition to standard chemotherapy in the
treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. For example,
published data supports that IFN-γ 1b plays a role in ovarian
cancer biology as follows: 1. Patients with low IFN-γ 1b expression in ovarian cancer samples appear to have a shorter
survival than those with high expression, [17]; 2. Proliferation of
ovarian cancer cells is inhibited by IFN-γ 1b in-vitro [6]; 3. The
combination of IFN-γ 1b and cytotoxic agents appear to result in
additive antiproliferative activity [5,18]; and 4. A phase II trial
comparing cisplatin/cyclophosphamide with or without IFN-γ 1b
resulted in prolonged PFS, but not OS in the IFN-γ 1b group [13].
After the results of the planned second interim analysis
revealed a statistically significant difference in survival that
crossed the pre-defined stopping boundary, the DSMB recommended termination of the ongoing post-treatment follow-up of

patients in the study. This recommendation was based on a
statistically shorter OS time in patients who received IFN-γ 1b
plus paclitaxel/carboplatin compared to paclitaxel/carboplatin
alone (p = 0.001). There was no difference in PFS time between
treatment groups (p = 0.796).
Hypotheses for the decrease in survival time in the patients
receiving IFN-γ 1b and chemotherapy include: 1. A direct toxicity of IFN-γ 1b; 2. Increased bone marrow toxicity resulting
from the combination of IFN-γ 1b and chemotherapy which
resulted in decreased treatment adherence, dose reductions, and
possibly less intensive second-line therapy; and 3. Activation of
regulatory T cells (Treg) cells resulting in immune suppression.
Less than 2% of patients in each treatment group died during
the treatment period. The imbalance in survival time across
treatment groups was driven by ovarian cancer-related deaths
that occurred during post-treatment follow-up after completion
of study therapy. The incidence of deaths unrelated to ovarian
cancer was b 2% overall and was similar between the treatment
groups. This would suggest that the difference in OS between the
two treatment groups was unlikely due to either acute or longterm toxicity of IFN-γ 1b. Exploratory analyses suggest that the
decrease in OS may have in part been related to dose reductions
of paclitaxel/carboplatin. Twenty-three percent of patients in the
IFN-γ 1b group did not complete all 6 cycles of paclitaxel/
carboplatin compared with 17% of patients in the chemotherapy
alone group. In addition, more patients treated with IFN-γ 1b
plus paclitaxel/carboplatin had treatment-limiting AEs that
led to a decrease in dose, interruption, or discontinuation of
chemotherapy.
The increase in treatment-limiting AEs observed in the
present trial may be related to the dosing of IFN-γ 1b. Patients
received twice the total dose of IFN-γ 1b over the course of the
trial compared to patients in the Windbichler trial, the original
phase 3 trial that led to the present study [11]. Patients receiving
IFN-γ 1b in the present trial followed a weekly dosing schedule
(i.e. 100 µg s.c. 3 times weekly) as opposed to the every other
week dosing schedule (i.e. IFN-γ 1b 100 µg s.c. 3 times
weekly) utilized by Windbichler et al.

IFN-γ 1b is a potent immune stimulatory cytokine; however,
under conditions of continuous exposure, such as with chronic
inflammation, immune suppression may occur [19–22]. IFN-γ 1b
can induce indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase which catalyzes tryptophan degradation and thus may reduce T lymphocyte proliferation
[23]. In fact, tryptophan degradation and subsequent neoptorin
production has been associated with the development of anemia
and cachexia. Moreover, elevated urinary neopterin excretion,
which indicates endogeneous non-specific immune stimulation,
has been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer [24].
More recently, it has been further clarified that the immune system
not only can protect the host against tumor development but can
also promote tumor growth through active tumor-induced
tolerance. Especially Treg cells, which are characterized by coexpression of CD4 and CD25, have been found to repress cancerrelated immune response [25]. There is new evidence that Treg
cells in ovarian carcinoma foster immune privilege by suppressing T lymphocytes, and are associated with reduced survival
[25,26]. Recently, it has been shown that IFN-γ 1b can have
paradoxical functions, eliciting inflammatory T helper 1 driven
responses in some circumstances, and enabling induced Treg cells
to suppress immune responses in others. IFN-γ is produced
rapidly and only transiently by induced Treg cells [27]. This early
production of IFN-γ during an immune response can directly
inhibit the activation and proliferation of IFN-γ -R1 and IFN-γ
-R2 bearing T cells. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility
that IFN-γ 1b treatment results in an activation of Treg cells which
consequently repress immune response and enable ovarian cancer
cells to escape immune surveillance.
Because this trial was terminated at the second interim
analysis, data concerning the type and amount of second-line
therapy for relapsing patients who completed the trial are not
available; nevertheless, it is important to point out that the
markedly increased toxicity associated with the experimental
regimen could have led to less intensive second-line therapy
for those patients randomized to the carboplatin/paclitaxel plus
IFN-γ 1b regimen. This in turn could have led to the observed
reduced survival.
There is increasing evidence that hematopoietic growth factors, particularly erythropoietin, may negatively impact survival
in cancer patients. [28,29] Since the carboplatin/paclitaxel plus
IFN-γ 1b arm as compared to chemotherapy alone was associated with significantly increased percentages of serious anemia
(i.e. serious adverse events reported in 5.2% vs. 2.6%), it is likely
that a higher proportion of patients in the experimental study arm
received supportive therapy with erythropoietin.
On the basis of the results of this large, well-designed phase 3
trial, which revealed a survival disadvantage associated with the
addition of IFN-γ 1b to a standard carboplatin plus paclitaxel
regimen, we must conclude that the combination of IFN-γ 1b
with a standard carboplatin plus paclitaxel regimen has no role in
the first-line management of advanced ovarian cancer. These
results also re-emphasize the “double-edged sword” of immunomodulation in the management of cancer and underscore the
need for further research aimed at clarifying the precise mechanisms through which emerging therapies modulate innate and
adaptive immune responses to tumors.
