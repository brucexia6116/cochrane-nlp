Abstract
Objective. Despite the improvement in progression-free and overall survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer associated with
platinum-taxane chemotherapy, strategies are needed to prevent the greater than 70% recurrence rate.
Method. The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) initiated a phase III intergroup trial of a-interferon (IFNa-26, Schering-Plough,
Kenilworth, NJ) in weekly doses of 50 Â 106 IU (for 6 doses) versus observation only in patients with no pathological evidence of residual
disease at second-look surgery in 1988.
Results. Patient accrual was extremely slow and the trial was permanently closed in 1999 by the SWOG Data and Safety Monitoring
Committee with <n>74</n> registered patients. Of these patients, 70 were evaluable for progression-free and overall survival. There was no
significant difference between the two study arms in relation to median progression-free survival (P = 0.56). The median survival duration
associated with intraperitoneal a-interferon had not been reached versus 87 months on the observation arm. In general, intraperitoneal ainterferon was well tolerated. There were no treatment-related deaths or grade 4 adverse events. Although no efficacy conclusions can be
drawn from this prematurely closed trial, it should be noted that 57% of the patients on the observation arm recurred and all died, whereas
63% recurred and only 43% died on the intraperitoneal a-interferon arm.
Conclusion. Although this was a negative study, there should continue to be interest in the use of biological therapy to improve survival
of patients in complete remission following primary chemotherapy.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from
gynecologic cancer and is the 4th leading cause of cancer
death overall among women in the United States. In 2005,
it is estimated that it was diagnosed in 22,220 women and

claimed 16,210 lives [1]. Because there are few specific
symptoms associated with early stage disease and because
there are no reliable screening tests capable of diagnosing
subclinical disease, the majority of women are diagnosed
when the disease has spread throughout the peritoneal
cavity (stage III) or beyond (stage IV) [2]. The characteristic that is most consistently predictive of survival in
women with stage III ovarian cancer is the amount of
residual disease left behind after staging laparotomy.

Advances in surgical technique now allow at least 50% of
women with stage III disease to be ‘‘optimally’’ debulked
at staging laparotomy so that there is no residual disease
greater than 1 cm in diameter.
Post-operative chemotherapy usually involves a combination of paclitaxel, at a dose of 175 mg/m2 (3-h infusion)
plus carboplatin (Area Under the Curve = 5 –7.5 mg Â min/
ml), based on the favorable pathologically proven complete
response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival
data related to the IV paclitaxel/carboplatin arm of GOG
158 [3]. These results (i.e., overall survival of 57.4 months)
have led the majority of oncologists to use this drug
combination for women with advanced stage disease for six
to eight courses. Generally, women who experience a
clinical complete remission are observed for recurrence at
regular intervals off any further therapy; however, data from
a recently published intergroup trial between the Southwest
Oncology Group (SWOG) and Gynecologic Oncology
Group (GOG) suggest that 12 monthly cycles of paclitaxel
as maintenance therapy prolong progression-free survival in
women who have achieved a clinical complete response to
primary platinum plus taxane treatment [4].
Patients with stage III ovarian cancer who have a
documented pathological complete response at second-look
surgery may be ideal candidates for maintenance therapy.
Unfortunately, these patients remain at relatively high risk
for relapse, in that, approximately 50% of these patients
will experience a disease recurrence [5 – 8]. Salvage
therapy at the time of recurrence may prolong survival
but is non-curative. Patients who attain a pathologic
complete response have a disease that is chemosensitive
and small in size (i.e., microscopic), and thus, additional
therapy with non-cross-resistant drugs prior to relapse
might be useful.
Pharmacokinetic data for intraperitoneal a-interferon
suggest extremely high levels of interferon with maximum
concentrations maintained for at least 24 h and low levels
detectable up to 72 h after treatment [9]. Peripheral blood
levels remain elevated for 5 to 6 days [9]. Ovarian cancer
was shown to be sensitive to the anti-proliferative effect of
human leukocyte a-interferon in vitro using the semi-solid
agar technique by Epstein in 1980 [10]. Since that time,
several phase I and II studies have been initiated in ovarian
cancer patients with advanced measurable disease, using
various a-interferon preparations, doses, and routes of
administration [11– 14]. In a phase II trial involving 18
evaluable patients, intraperitoneally administered a-interferon was associated with 10 clinical complete and 3 partial
responses [15].
An additional phase II pilot study was performed by
Berek et al. to evaluate intraperitoneal a-interferon as
salvage immunotherapy in stage III ovarian cancer [9]. Of
11 surgically evaluable patients, four (36%) achieved a
pathological complete response, one (9%) achieved a partial
response, and six patients (55%) had progressive disease.
Five of seven patients (71%) with residual tumor <5 mm

had surgically documented responses. That trial provided a
rationale for the use of intraperitoneal a-interferon in an
adjuvant setting following cytotoxic chemotherapy hoping
to maintain a higher percentage of patients in complete
remission.

Methods and materials
Eligibility criteria
Each of the following eligibility criteria had to be met:
(1) patients must have had a histologically confirmed
diagnosis of stage III ovarian carcinoma with initial
surgery (consisting of at least a bilateral salpingooophorectomy, total hysterectomy, and omentectomy)
prior to receiving primary chemotherapy, and found to
be disease-free at second-look surgery after completion of
a regimen containing a cumulative dose of cisplatin
(!400 mg/m2) or carboplatin (!1200 mg/m2 or total
AUC !20 mg Â min/ml); (2) no more than 120 days
elapsed between completion of chemotherapy and secondlook surgery and second-look surgery must have been
performed according to GOG guidelines; (3) patients
must have had histologically confirmed grade 2 (moderately differentiated) or 3 (poorly differentiated or undifferentiated) epithelial ovarian cancer confirmed with
central pathology review; (4) patients must have had a
SWOG performance status of 0 –2; (5) patients must have
had adequate marrow reserve as evidenced by a WBC
!3500 Al, and platelet count !100,000/Al, adequate renal
function as evidenced by a serum creatinine
the
institutional upper limit of normal, and adequate hepatic
function as defined by total serum bilirubin
institutional upper limit of normal within 28 days prior to
registration; (6) all patients must have had a patent
intraperitoneal space at the time of second-look surgery
(and no evidence of ascites); and (7) registration had to
take place no later than 42 days following second-look
surgery.

Randomization/stratification factors
After signing institutional review board (IRB)approved consent forms, patient randomization to intraperitoneal a-interferon or observation was stratified by
cooperative group (i.e., SWOG or GOG) and prior
intraperitoneal cisplatin administration or not.
The study planned to enroll one hundred sixty-five
eligible patients. Assuming uniform patient entry during
enrollment and 3 additional years’ follow-up after accrual
completion, exponential survival distributions, and a onesided logrank test at 0.05 significance level, the power to
detect a difference in disease-free survival is 0.85 if the true
hazard ratio is 1.75. A hazard ratio of 1.75 in this setting

D.S. Alberts et al. / Gynecologic Oncology 100 (2006) 133 – 138

corresponds to an approximate increase in the 5-year
disease-free survival rate from 40% to 60%.

Treatment plan
This phase III trial received local IRB review and approval
according to institutional guidelines. Patients randomized to
Arm 1 who had an intraperitoneal (IP) catheter in place at the
time of registration had to begin IP treatment with ainterferon (IFNa-26, Intron A; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth,
NJ) within 2 weeks of registration. Patients who did not have
an IP catheter in place at the time of registration had to have
had the catheter in place and began IP treatment with ainterferon within 3 weeks of registration. It was recommended that the IP catheter be placed in time to allow at least 7
days of healing before the beginning of IP treatment.
Although a semi-permanent peritoneal catheter was desirable, a-interferon could also have been administered using a
temporary placement of an intracath-type catheter. For those
patients receiving a semi-permanent catheter, an intravenous
porta-cath inserted into the peritoneal space was recommended, but not required. During Week 1, the patient was to
receive the initial dose of a-interferon intraperitoneally,
followed by five additional weekly doses. The patient was
observed in the clinical area for a minimum of 2 h following
the IP instillation. Instructions for instillation of IP ainterferon are outlined below.
Procedure for instillation of intraperitoneal a-interferon
6

50 Â 10 IU of a-interferon were to be placed into
solution of 100 ml normal saline and added to 1000 cc of
dialysate. Following infusion of dialysate containing ainterferon, an additional 1000 cc of dialysate without ainterferon was infused into the intraperitoneal space.

Toxicities monitored and dosage modification
Prior to administration of each course of a-interferon,
patients must have been without symptoms of infection,
platelets must have been !100,000/Al, WBC !3500 Al, and
all toxicities must have resolved to
grade 2. The ainterferon dose was to be reduced to 25 Â 106 IU on the
next planned course of therapy if there is grade 3 or 4
granulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia which persists at
grade !1 on the day of next treatment.

Results
Participant accrual and demographics
The study was activated on March 1, 1988 in the SWOG
and in 1998 in the GOG and was closed permanently on

135

June 5, 1999 due to poor accrual. Seventy-four patients were
registered out of a planned 165 eligible patients. Four
patients were ineligible. Efficacy assessment was possible
for 70 patients, 35 in each of the two arms.
Shown in Table 1 are the patient characteristics for all
eligible participants. There were no significant differences
between the two study arms for any characteristic. The
median age for the intraperitoneal a-interferon-treated
patients was 56 years and for the observation group, 53
years. Sixty-six of the patients were entered by the SWOG
and four patients by the GOG. Intraperitoneal cisplatin had
been administered during first-line therapy to 6 (17%) of the
intraperitoneal a-interferon-treated patients and 8 (23%) of
the observation-only patients. Eighty-nine percent of the
patients on both arms of the study had undergone optimal
surgical debulking prior to primary chemotherapy. Two of
the intraperitoneal a-interferon-treated patients were African
American versus none on the observation-only arm.
Progression-free and overall survival data
Thirty-two (91%) of the 35 patients on the intraperitoneal
a-interferon arm completed all six courses of planned
therapy. Three patients did not complete all therapy due to

adverse events or toxicity (i.e., grade 3 leukopenia,
vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and/or headache).
As shown in Fig. 1, there was no significant difference
between the two study arms in relation to median progression-free survival (PFS). The median PFS for the intraperitoneal a-interferon arm was 47 months [95% confidence
interval (CI): 18 –160 months; 22 patients] and the median
PFS for the observation-only arm was 94 months (95% CI:
21 –102 months; 20 patients recurred, one-sided P = 0.56).
The seemingly large difference in the median estimates was
an artifact, because the medians occurred in a flat area of
the progression-free survival curves. Therefore, the uncertainties associated with estimates were very large, as
reflected by the wide confidence intervals. As shown in
Fig. 2, there was a trend toward increased median survival
duration associated with the intraperitoneal a-interferon
arm as demonstrated by the 15 deaths (43%) of the 35
eligible patients. On the observation-only arm, the estimated median survival was 87 months with 20 (57%)

deaths among the 35 eligible patients (one-sided P = 0.09).
Of those still alive, the median follow-up was 147 months,
range 36 to 191 months.

Adverse events
Shown in Table 2 are the grade 2 and 3 adverse events
possibly, probably, or definitely thought to be related to
intraperitoneal a-interferon. We have excluded those types
of adverse events for which the highest severity level
reported was no higher than grade 1. There were no grade 4
adverse events and no drug- or treatment-related deaths.
Grade 3 adverse events included abdominal pain (1 patient),
diarrhea (2 patients), fatigue (5 patients), fever with or
without neutropenia (2 patients), headache (3 patients),
leukopenia (1 patient), nausea (5 patients), pain not of
abdominal origin (1 patient), and vomiting (5 patients). In
total, 14 patients (40%) experienced a grade 3 adverse event

and one patient experienced a grade 1 adverse event as their
maximum toxicity experience.

Discussion
By all criteria, this was an unsuccessful phase III trial.
Patient accrual was extremely slow (i.e., 74 patients over
approximately 11 years) and there was no definitive result.
A Data Safety and Monitoring Committee of the SWOG
appropriately closed the study because accrual over the last
2 study years had been only 13 patients, despite study
activation by the GOG. The likely reason for poor accrual
relates to the use of a ‘‘no treatment’’ control arm in the
setting of full patient knowledge of the high risk of
recurrence and almost certain subsequent death. Nevertheless, the study results are of considerable interest from
two points of view. First, despite the strict surgical criteria
required for a pathologically negative second-look surgical
procedure in the SWOG and GOG, an unexpectedly high
percentage (60%) of the 70 eligible patients recurred. This
high recurrence rate may be related to the fact that more than
80% of patients did not receive a taxane as a part of their
remission induction therapy. During the time of enrollment
(1980s to mid 1990s), the taxanes were not generally
available. At least two phase III trials documented higher

137

clinical complete response rates and longer progression-free
and overall survival durations when paclitaxel was added to
cisplatin as compared to cyclophosphamide added to
cisplatin [16,17].
Second, eight (four on each of the two study arms) of the
recurrences occurred between 6 and 13 years of patient
follow-up, indicating that these women harbored submicroscopic clones of indolent ovarian cancer cells resistant to
cytotoxic therapy. This cell growth phenomenon argues for
the use of biological agents, such as bevacizumab and
erlotinib, to hit specific molecular targets to eradicate these
clones and/or immune modifiers, such as g-interferon, to
suppress cellular regrowth [18 – 21].
The use of immunoadjuvants, such as a-interferon, in
treatment of epithelial ovarian carcinomas is based on the
presence of ovarian tumor antigens, data from animal
studies, studies of immunological capacities of cancer
patients, and information regarding therapy interactions
[22 –24]. Gresser evaluated a-interferon against a series of
ascites tumors in different strains of mice and found that
daily treatments inhibited tumor growth and prolonged
survival [25]. Optimal effects were achieved when ainterferon was administered intraperitoneally, rather than
intravenously. The appearance of a potential survival
difference with no progression-free survival difference is
likely to be a chance occurrence, given the small sample
sizes overall; however, there is a precedent for high dose ainterferon being associated with survival prolongation in the
adjuvant setting in post-surgical patients with a deep
primary or regionally metastatic melanoma [26].
Consolidation therapy for ovarian cancer patients who
have experienced a clinical complete response during
primary platinum plus taxane-based treatment is undergoing
further study, now that the SWOG and GOG have published
the positive results of a phase III trial comparing 12 courses
versus 3 courses of intravenous paclitaxel [4]. In light of
these results and the prolonged survival advantages of firstline intraperitoneal therapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel
[27 –29], further studies of intraperitoneally administered
biological agents should be considered in the setting of
consolidation therapy.
