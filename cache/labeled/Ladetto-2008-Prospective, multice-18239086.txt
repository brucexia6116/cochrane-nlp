In this randomized multicenter study of
<n>136</n> patients, 6 courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) followed by rituximab (CHOP-R)
were
compared
with
rituximabsupplemented high-dose sequential chemotherapy with autografting (R-HDS) to
assess the value of intensiﬁed chemotherapy as a ﬁrst-line treatment for highrisk follicular lymphoma (FL) after the
introduction of monoclonal antibodies.
The analysis was intention to treat with
event-free survival (EFS) as the primary
endpoint. Complete remission (CR)
was 62% with CHOP-R and 85% with

R-HDS (P < .001). At a median follow-up
(MFU) of 51 months, the 4-year EFS was
28% and 61%, respectively (P < .001),
with no difference in overall survival
(OS). Molecular remission (MR) was
achieved in 44% of CHOP-R and 80% of
R-HDS patients (P < .001), and was the
strongest independent outcome predictor. Patients relapsing after CHOP-R underwent salvage R-HDS in 71% of cases.
Salvage R-HDS had an 85% CR rate and
a 68% 3-year EFS (MFU, 30 months). We
conclude that (1) achieving MR is
critical for effective disease control, regardless of which treatment is used;

(2) R-HDS ensures superior disease
control and molecular outcome than
CHOP-R, but no OS improvement; and
(3) CHOP-R failures have a good
outcome after salvage R-HDS, suggesting that relapsed/refractory FL could
be the most appropriate setting for
R-HDS–like treatments. This trial was
registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as
no. NCT00435955. (Blood. 2008;111:

Introduction
In the last 15 years, our approach to treatment of follicular
lymphoma (FL) has evolved considerably, chieﬂy due to 3 major
achievements. First, new agents, particularly rituximab, have
improved overall outcome in patients with FL.1,2 Second, a subset
of patients with a rapid and progressive course has been recognized.3-5 The International Prognostic Index (IPI), the age-adjusted
IPI (aaIPI), and more recent FL-speciﬁc scores such as the
Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi (IIL) score and Follicular Lymphoma
International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) now allow simple and
effective identiﬁcation of these high-risk patients, whose manage-

ment is currently far from satisfactory.4,5 Finally, many phase 2
studies have demonstrated that the achievement of molecular
remission (MR) as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
is associated with a better outcome in the context of a wide array of
different treatments.6-11
In this rapidly evolving ﬁeld, the place for intensiﬁed regimens
with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is poorly deﬁned. Most data arise from pre-rituximab studies.12-16 ASCT
improves overall survival (OS) in relapsed patients,7,12 while data
at diagnosis are less clear. The 3 phase 3 studies published so far

have been based on total body irradiation (TBI)–containing regimens, did not select patients according to validated prognostic
scores, and did not include molecular analysis.13-15 Two of these
trials showed that intensive therapy ensures better progression-free
survival (PFS) than does conventional therapy.13,14 However, in the
Groupe Ouest-Est Leucemies et Maladies du Sang (GOELAMS)
´
trial, signiﬁcant extramortality from secondary tumors was recorded in the intensiﬁed arm.14 Moreover, the recently published
Groupe d’Etude des Lymphomes de l’Adulte (GELA) trial found
no advantage for patients undergoing intensive treatment.15 These
results led to the belief that ASCT is not superior to conventional
chemotherapy in unselected patients with FL.
Our previous Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo
(GITMO) experience using high-dose sequential chemotherapy
with a ﬁnal TBI-free ASCT (high-dose sequential chemotherapy
[HDS]) provided further evidence for consideration.9,17 In particular, we observed that patients with an elevated aaIPI seem to have a
more favorable outcome than expected, suggesting that HDS is
particularly suitable for this speciﬁc subset. In addition, prerituximab data suggest that HDS regimens might be associated
with fewer second tumors compared with alternative autografting
programs potentially because there is no TBI and large stem cell
grafts are infused.16,17
The present multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial took
advantage of these observations. We compared a rituximab-supplemented version of HDS (R-HDS) with 6 courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone) supplemented by an identical number of rituximab courses (CHOP-R) in high-risk patients with
FL. High risk was deﬁned according to the aaIPI score (Ն 2) or the IIL
score (Ն 3). The primary endpoint of the study was event-free survival
(EFS). Secondary clinical endpoints were response rate, OS, PFS, and
disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, centralized molecular analysis
was planned to prospectively explore the value of MR as an outcome
predictor and to determine whether the 2 treatments showed any
difference in their MR rates.

Methods
Patient inclusion criteria
Patients aged 18 to 60 years were eligible if they had Ann Arbor stage III or
IV FL according to the Revised European-American Lymphoma/World

consisted of doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) on days 1 and 22,
vincristine (1.2 mg/m2) on days 1 and 15, and prednisone (50 mg/m2) on days 1 to 22. The DHAP course
consisted of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) on day 1, Ara-C
(4 g/m2) on day 2, and dexamethasone (40 mg) on days
1 to 4. hd-VP16 indicates high-dose etoposide; hd-Cy,

R-HDS VERSUS CHOP-R IN FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMA

Health Organization (REAL/WHO) lymphoma classiﬁcation (grades I, II,
and III; patients with grade IIIb were not excluded).18 Eligible patients had
no history of cancer and were chemotherapy- or extended-ﬁeld radiotherapy–
free. High-risk disease was deﬁned by an aaIPI score of 2 or greater or an
IIL score of 3 or greater (the IIL score includes the following parameters:
age, sex, number of extranodal sites, B symptoms, serum LDH level, and
erythrocyte sedimentation rate).19 Absence of concurrent heart, kidney,
lung, or liver disease was required, plus HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
negativity. Hepatitis B virus (HBV)–positive patients without active viral
replication were eligible under lamivudine prophylaxis. Informed consent
was obtained from all patients, and the institutional review boards of all the
participating centers approved the study (for a list of the participating
centers, see Document S1, available on the Blood website; see the
Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).
Study design and procedures
A centralized computer generated a simple randomization sequence.
Following veriﬁcation of eligibility criteria, patients were randomly
assigned either to the intensiﬁed or conventional arm. The randomization
sequence was concealed during the entire eligibility veriﬁcation procedure.
The conventional arm (CHOP-R) has already been described by Rambaldi
et al8 and consisted of 6 CHOP courses followed by infusions of
4 375 mg/m2 rituximab. The R-HDS schedule was an adaptation of
previously described rituximab-free regimens,9,17,20-22 and consisted of
3 phases: (1) intensive debulking; (2) high-dose (HD) chemotherapy with
stem cell collection of in vivo purged peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs);
and (3) autografting. Phase 1 included 2 complete, full-dose APO (doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) courses, totaling four 75 mg/m2 doxorubicin
administrations. Patients not achieving CR following these courses received 2 additional DHAP (Ara-C, cisplatin, dexamethasone) courses. The
HD phase consisted of 2 g/m2 etoposide (VP16) followed by a chemotherapyfree interval of 40 days for optimal PBSC mobilization. During this phase,
patients received 2 rituximab courses (375 mg/m2). Then, 7 g/m2 cyclophosphamide (Cy) was delivered. In vivo purging was performed by delivering
2 rituximab doses (375 mg/m2) on the day after Cy, and on the ﬁrst day the
patient had a white blood cell count greater than 1000/␮L. HD courses were
supported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 5 ␮g/kg/
day). A minimum of 5 ϫ 106 CD34ϩ cells/kg was required for autologous
transplantation with PBSCs only (plus at least 3 ϫ 106 CD34ϩ cells/kg or a
bone marrow harvest as backup). Patients failing to meet this minimum did
not undergo autografting. The autografting conditioning regimen has been
described in detail elsewhere,9,17,20-22 and consisted of mitoxantrone
(60 mg/m2) on day Ϫ5 and melphalan (180 mg/m2) on day Ϫ2. In both
treatment arms, patients in partial response (PR) or who remained PCRϩ
received 2 ﬁnal rituximab courses at the end of the program. Radiotherapy
(30-36 Gy) was planned in both treatment arms on bulky sites or on residual

masses approximately 2 months after the end of treatment. The
2 treatment arms are shown schematically in Figure 1.
This study also included detailed records of salvage treatment for
patients with a ﬁrst relapse or progression. In case of R-HDS failure, the
salvage treatment was free. In case of CHOP-R failure, most centers (90%)
agreed to treat patients with R-HDS (crossover). Only patients with the
following characteristics were not considered eligible for crossover:
(1) localized, limited relapse; (2) relapses requiring a speciﬁc treatment
such as central nervous system or testis; (3) the presence of severe
comorbidities; (4) age older than 60 years at the time of starting R-HDS;
and (5) patient refusal. Patients with histologic shifts at relapse were not
excluded from crossover and were included in the analysis. When delivered
at relapse, the R-HDS schedule was identical with the exception that no
APO courses were delivered in order to avoid excessive cardiac toxicity in
patients already treated with CHOP. Thus, these patients started their
R-HDS schedule from the 2 DHAP courses.
Study endpoints and statistical considerations
The primary endpoint was EFS. EFS was deﬁned according to the Cheson
criteria,23 which include relapse, progression, or death for any cause, but not
treatment interruption for toxicity or poor mobilization. Secondary endpoints were response rate, OS, PFS, DFS (all deﬁned according to the
Cheson criteria),23 incidence of secondary myelodysplasia or acute myeloid
leukemias (sMDS/AML) and solid malignancy, MR rate, and impact of MR
on PFS. Molecular analysis was performed in a central highly experienced
translational laboratory.9,17,24
A sample size of 246 patients (123 per arm) over 5 years was
required to detect a 20% absolute increase (from 35%-55%) in 3-year
EFS with an ␣ error of .05 and a ␤ error of .20, with a median follow-up
of 3 years. A single interim analysis was planned, including the
120 patients who completed the treatment before March 24, 2005.
R-HDS showed a signiﬁcant EFS improvement (29% absolute increase,
from 35%-64%), compared with CHOP-R (P Ͻ .001); this result led the
steering committee to stop enrollment on May 30, 2005. For the present
analysis, times of observation were censored on June 1, 2007, providing
a median EFS and OS follow-up time of 51 months. Analyses were done
on an intention-to-treat basis.
Patient characteristics were compared between the 2 arms using the
Pearson ␹2 test or the Fisher exact test for discrete variables and the
Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. All reported P values are
2-sided at the conventional 5% signiﬁcance level. EFS, OS, DFS, and PFS
were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, comparing the 2 arms by
the log-rank test and calculating 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs).25,26 The
Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of different
prognostic factors on OS, EFS, PFS, and DFS.27 Covariates were sex; age;
histologic grade; Ann Arbor stage; aaIPI score; FLIPI score (retrospectively
assigned); “B” symptoms; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)

performance status; LDH; bulky disease (Ͼ 5 cm diameter); spleen, bone
marrow, and extranodal involvement; treatment arm; MR; and achievement
of CR/CR unconﬁrmed (CRu) only for OS. As far as the incidence of
sMDS/AML and solid tumors are concerned, the Gray test was used to
compare the cumulative incidence curves of any risk factor, among
different groups in the presence of a competing risk (always deﬁned as
death from any other causes other than sMDS/AML or solid tumors).28 All
reported P values are 2-sided at the conventional 5% signiﬁcance level.
Data were analyzed as of August 2007 using SPSS 13.0.1 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL).
MRD assessment by nested PCR
All patients with an available diagnostic tumor specimen were screened for
the Bcl-2/IgH translocation. Nested PCR was carried out on bone marrow
(BM) samples as described by Gribben et al.6 Given the extremely effective
clearance of FL cells from circulation ensured by rituximab and the
less-established predictive value, peripheral blood was not used for minimal
residual disease (MRD) analysis. When the Bcl-2/IgH translocation could
not be ampliﬁed, an alternative tumor marker was sought by amplifying and
sequencing the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) gene rearrangement.29
MRD was detected as described elsewhere.6,29
The minimal schedule for PCR monitoring was as follows: BM at
diagnosis, one BM sample at the end of treatment, and one at months 6 to
12 from the end. Additional samples were analyzed yearly if the patient and
the treating physician wished to continue the molecular follow-up. A single
follow-up sample was considered informative only in cases of CR/CRu
lasting less than 6 months. Patients were considered evaluable for
molecular analysis if they reached CR/CRu and had a valid molecular
marker and 2 posttreatment follow-up samples spaced at least 6 months
apart. Patients were considered in MR if 2 or more consecutive samples
were PCR negative.

Results
Patient characteristics

Between March 2000 and May 2005, 136 patients were treated at
30 Italian hematologic centers. Patients characteristics are shown in
Table 1. All participating centers were enabled by GITMO to
perform ASCT (median yearly number of ASCTs, 36; range,
14-100) and enrolled a median number of 4 patients each (range,
1-19 patients). Two CHOP-R patients were inappropriately enrolled and not included in the analysis (one withdrew consent
before treatment start and one patient lacked a documented aaIPI
score of 2 or greater). All other patients were included in the

analysis. Only 2 patients (both CHOP-R) were censored as “lost to
follow-up” at the closing date for the analysis after a follow-up of
23 and 6 months, respectively.
Feasibility, early toxicity, and response rate

A total of 71% of patients concluded CHOP-R. Failures were mostly
due to progression (26%). Toxicity failures were 3%. Despite its
complexity, 79% of patients completed R-HDS. The causes for discontinuation were progression (7%) and toxicity (7%). In addition,
3 patients did not undergo ASCT because of poor stem-cell mobilization, and one discontinued R-HDS before ASCT, citing family problems. In the R-HDS arm, the planned delivery of 2 extra-DHAP courses
for patients not in CR was performed in 42 (61%) patients. The planned
delivery of 2 more rituximab courses in case of PR or PCR positivity
was performed in 13 CHOP-R patients (5 due to PR and 8 due to PCR
positivity) and 7 R-HDS patients (3 due to PR and 4 due to PCRpositivity). Consolidation radiotherapy was delivered to 31 (46%) and
28 (41%) patients, respectively (P ϭ .15).
A total of 5 early toxic deaths (within day 100 from ASCT)
occurred in the whole population. One CHOP-R patient had a
sudden death following the ﬁrst infusion and another died of
Gram-negative sepsis following the third course. One R-HDS
patient had an interstitial pneumonia during the second debulking
course, one had a Gram-positive sepsis 65 days after ASCT, and
one had a graft failure.
A total of 7 nonfatal grades III to IV early extrahematologic
(within day 100 from ASCT) toxicities occurred in the CHOP-R
arm. Of these, 4 were of infectious nature. A total of 26 nonfatal
grades III to IV extrahematologic early toxicities occurred in the
R-HDS arm (excluding ASCT-related oral or gastrointestinal
mucositis), leading to a signiﬁcant (P Ͻ .001) toxicity surplus.
Infectious toxicity accounted for 9 episodes.
Response rates were as follows: CR/CRu were 62% following
CHOP-R and 85% following R-HDS (P Ͻ .001), and PR were 8%
and 5%, respectively. Progressive or stable disease occurred in 30%
of CHOP-R patients and 10% of R-HDS patients.

Late toxicity and clinical outcome

Median follow-up for EFS and OS was 51 months. Late toxicities
in the CHOP-R arm were as follows: one fatal sMDS/AML in a
patient with relapsed disease who received 6 ﬂudarabinemitoxantrone, dexamethasone regimens as salvage treatment: one
head-and-neck cancer, one bladder cancer, and one suspected lung
cancer. The 3 solid cancers occurred in patients that were still in
remission following CHOP-R. In the R-HDS arm, we recorded
5 cases of sMDS/AML (3 fatal) and one fatal gastric cancer. All
sMDS/AML occurred in patients that were still in remission from
their FL. The cumulative incidence of sMDS/AML at 4 years was
6.6% for R-HDS and 1.7% for CHOP-R (P ϭ .111; Figure 2A). For
solid tumor, the cumulative incidence at 4 years was 1.5% for both
arms (Figure 2B). No late nonneoplastic toxicities have been
reported including cardiotoxicity. There were 9 lymphoma-related
deaths in the CHOP-R arm and 7 in the R-HDS arm. At the closing
date, 105 (78%) patients were alive. Sixty-three (47%) were alive
in continuous CR, 21 (32%) following CHOP-R, and 42 (62%)
following R-HDS (P Ͻ .001). The 4-year OS and EFS for the
whole population are 80% and 44%, respectively (data not shown).
Patient outcome according to treatment arm is shown in Figure 3.
The 4-year OS was similar in the 2 arms, with 80% of patients
surviving after CHOP-R and 81% after R-HDS (Figure 3A;
P ϭ .96). The 4-year projected values for CHOP-R and R-HDS
were 28% and 61% for EFS (P Ͻ .001; Figure 3B), 31% and
68% for PFS (P Ͻ .001; Figure 3C), and 45% and 76% for
DFS (P Ͻ .001; Figure 3D). Of note, advantage of R-HDS for
PFS and EFS was observed both in grades I, II, and III histologies
(data not shown).
Molecular outcome

Tumor samples were available at diagnosis for 104 patients (78%;
Figure 4A). A molecular marker was obtained for 73 patients (70%;
bcl-2/IgH in 65 patients and IgH rearrangement in 8 patients). Of
these 73 patients, 13 did not achieve CR/CRu, leaving 60 patients

for molecular evaluation (25 CHOP-R patients and 35 R-HDS
patients). Overall, 165 bone marrow follow-up determinations
were performed (median number of follow-up determinations per
patient, 2; range, 1-5). Overall, 65% of evaluable patients achieved
MR (Figure 4B). The MR rate was 44% in patients treated with
CHOP-R and 80% in patients treated with R-HDS (P Ͻ .002;
Figure 4B). Patients in MR had a better PFS compared with those
without MR (Figure 4C; P Ͻ .001). Interestingly, the outcome of
patients achieving MR was similar regardless of treatment received
as was the outcome of patients not achieving MR (Figure 4D,E).
This result suggests that the superior disease control of R-HDS is
associated with the increased number of MRs observed with this
regimen.
Risk factor analysis

The impact of different variables on survival was assesed using
univariate and multivariate analysis (Tables 2,3). Cox regression
analysis shows that OS is affected by ECOG performance status
and by lack of CR/CRu. The most important adverse prognostic
factor for EFS, PFS, and DFS was lack of MR (Table 3). However,
when the analysis was performed without considering PCR results,
in order to take into account the whole patient population, R-HDS
was the strongest protective factor for EFS, PFS, and DFS.
Outcome after failure of ﬁrst-line treatment

The type and outcome of rescue treatment are available for the
entire population, except for one patient who was lost to follow-up.
Thus far, 40 failures due to relapsed or refractory disease occurred
following CHOP-R. A total of 12 patients who failed with CHOP-R
did not undergo crossover treatment because of minimal relapse
(4 patients), refusal (3 patients), comorbidity (2 patients), unusual
relapse site (2 patienst), and age older than 60 years (1 patient).
A total of 28 patients who failed CHOP-R received R-HDS. The

overall feasibility of salvage R-HDS was 78%. A total of 4 (14%)
patients progressed under salvage R-HDS. A total of 2 patients
undergoing salvage R-HDS were unable to mobilize PBSCs. No
early toxic deaths were recorded. So far, no sMDS/AML or solid
tumors were recorded: this may be due to the relatively short
follow-up. The overall CR/CRu rate of CHOP-R failures was 76%,
while the CR/Cru rate for those receiving salvage R-HDS was
85%. At a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year EFS and OS
projection for the whole population of CHOP-R failures are 64%
and 73% (data not shown), while for those rescued with R-HDS are
68% and 81% (Figure 5).
A total of 18 relapses or disease progressions occurred in the
R-HDS arm. There was no speciﬁc indication for salvage treatment. Of note, 7 patients had limited/localized relapses and were
treated with chemotherapy-free regimens such as rituximab or
radiotherapy; 4 of these patients achieved a second CR/CRu.

Discussion
This study describes the results of the GITMO/IIL multicenter
randomized trial comparing CHOP-R and R-HDS in high-risk
patients with FL. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study
evaluating conventional versus intensiﬁed therapy in FL both
supplemented with rituximab and the ﬁrst randomized study
speciﬁcally focusing on high-risk patients with FL. In addition,
it is the ﬁrst phase 3 trial in which a large proportion of patients
underwent centralized, prospective molecular evaluation. Intention-to-treat analysis indicates the following: (1) MR is the
strongest protective factor for EFS, PFS, and DFS, with a clear
positive impact regardless of treatment arm; (2) R-HDS allows
better disease control, as shown by its superior CR and MR
rates, PFS, and EFS; (3) despite its superior EFS and MR rate,

R-HDS does not improve OS; nevertheless, in both arms, OS
appears improved compared with historic pre-rituximab ﬁndings4; and (4) patients with relapsed or refractory disease
following CHOP-R can be rescued with R-HDS with a 3-year
EFS of 70%. These results, together with the nonnegligible incidence
of secondary sMDS/AML in the intensiﬁed arm, indicate that the most
appropriate positioning for R-HDS–like regimens might not be at
diagnosis, but as second-line treatment for patients with refractory or
relapsed disease.
The superior disease control obtained with intensiﬁed versus
conventional treatment was a matter of debate in the prerituximab and pre–risk stratiﬁcation era. A recent paper from the
Dana Farber Cancer Institute provides a very mature analysis of
96 patients and suggests that approximately 40% of patients
with FL undergoing ASCT as ﬁrst-line treatment became
long-term disease-free survivors.11 Current data from randomized trials are less mature, and their results are somehow
discrepant. The GOELAMS and the German Low-Grade Lymphoma Study Group showed that autografting-based regimens
have a better PFS compared with conventional therapy.13,14 In
contrast, the GELA trial showed no differences between treat-

ments.15 The inclusion of rituximab in the treatment of FL at
diagnosis has clearly improved the outcome of conventional
chemotherapy as shown by several randomized trials.30,31 However, it is unknown if rituximab is equally beneﬁcial when
combined with intensiﬁed ASCT-containing programs. Indeed,
on the one hand, one might expect to see the advantages of
ASCT in terms of PFS diminish after the inclusion of rituximab.
On the other hand, one could expect rituximab to provide “added
value” also in the context of ASCT-containing programs (eg, by
enhancing the collection of PCRϪ grafts through its welldescribed in vivo purging effect).32 Our results clearly indicate that
rituximab positively affects both the conventional and the intensiﬁed treatment schedule, leading to a PFS advantage similar to that
observed in the most positive study performed in the pre-rituximab
age, namely the report from the German Low-Grade Lymphoma
Study Group.13 In this trial, rituximab was delivered sequentially
and not concurrently. Although not formally proven, most clinicians believe that concurrent delivery might be more effective.
However it is difﬁcult to hypothesize that concurrent rituximab
delivery could allow for the improvement of PFS in the conventional arm up to the level observed with R-HDS.

Figure 5. Outcome of patients undergoing salvage R-HDS after CHOP-R failure. (A) OS for salvage R-HDS patients. (B) EFS for salvage R-HDS patients.

Despite a major PFS and EFS advantage for R-HDS, no OS
difference was recorded between the 2 arms, even if the trial
included exclusively high-risk patients. In addition, it should be
noted that, despite a large number of early relapses, approximately
30% of CHOP-R patients enjoyed a prolonged disease-free period
associated with few, if any, late disease–related events. This
ﬁnding, together with the observation that a similar proportion of
patients achieved MR exclusively with CHOP-R, indicates that
front-line R-HDS would probably be an overtreatment for a
nonnegligible subgroup of patients.
It should be noted that the extremely high early relapse rate
following conventional chemotherapy is balanced by the good
outcome of patients undergoing R-HDS as salvage treatment,
leading to a similar rate of lymphoma-related deaths in the
2 arms. In our experience, the use of R-HDS at relapse was not
hampered by eligibility issues (few patients were excluded due
to comorbidities) and showed a feasibility identical to that
observed at diagnosis, including the critical issue of adequate
collection of PBSCs. Moreover, the 68% 3-year EFS data
indicate that the antitumor effect of R-HDS was not hampered
by previous delivery of a single line of conventional chemotherapy and rituximab. Longer follow-up is required to be sure
that the rate of long-term survivors following salvage R-HDS is
similar to that observed at diagnosis. Indeed, the very mature
data from Rohatiner et al show a good long-term outcomes for
patients receiving ASCT as second-line treatment, suggesting
that intensiﬁed procedures retain high efﬁcacy at least when
used as ﬁrst salvage treatment.33
Toxicity issues support delayed use of R-HDS. In our experience, similar numbers of early toxic deaths were recorded in the
2 arms. However, the rate of secondary MDS is higher in the
intensiﬁed arm, with a 4-year cumulative incidence of 6.6% versus
1.7% (P ϭ .111), and additional cases might potentially occur in
the future with a longer follow-up. A recent review of the rate of
sMDS/AML and solid tumors in 1266 patients treated with HDS or
R-HDS indicates that the rate of these complications is lower
compared with TBI-containing programs.34 Nevertheless, currently
effective approaches are available to treat even late-phase FL,
while sMDS/AML remains a rapidly fatal disease. Thus, we

believe that the current risk of sMDS/AML, while if lower
compared with that observed with TBI-containing regimens,16 still
argues against a front-line use of ASCT given the possibility of a
very effective delivery of this treatment at ﬁrst relapse. One feature
of this study is the use of restrictive inclusion criteria, deﬁned
according to validated prognostic scores.5 This arose from the
observation that rituximab-free HDS was particularly suitable for
high-risk patients.9 Moreover, the 3 previously mentioned randomized studies uniformly showed better performance of intensiﬁed
treatment in retrospectively assigned high-risk subgroups.12-14
When this study was launched, 2 prognostic scores were available:
the aaIPI and the IIL scores. Currently, the FLIPI is considered the
most suitable score for patients with FL. As expected by the
different parameters included in these scores, a proportion of our
patients were not “high risk” according to retrospective FLIPI assigment. Moreover, FLIPI was not predictive for outcome in our series.
This ﬁnding should not be overemphasized and needs cautious consideration: ﬁrst, FLIPI retrospective assignation could have introduced a bias;
second, patients who did not score as “high risk” according to FLIPI are
not an unselected “standard risk” population, as they were selected
according to previous scores and thus clearly belonged to a severely ill
population (5-year OS, 43.6% for aaIPI score of 2 or greater and 38%
for ILI score greater than 34 as opposed to 52.5% for a FLIPI score of
3 or greater).5 However, independent of the score considered, the 80%
4-year OS globally observed in our trial suggests that the outcome of
high-risk patients with FL has improved compared with historic
pre-rituximab data.4
A total of 16 years have passed since the ﬁrst observations
that PCR negativity plays a role in the outcome of patients with
FL.35 It is true that bcl-2/IgH PCR still requires some standardization, including quality assurance, ﬁxed analysis time-points,
and standard tissue source (all the most predictive studies were
based on BM). However, during this 16-year period, a number of
reports have conﬁrmed the critical value of MR achievement in
disparate settings, including single- and multicenter trials,
conventional and intensiﬁed treatments, rituximab-free and
rituximab-based treatments. In addition, MR has a high predictive value also in series with a very prolonged follow-up.10,11
This suggests that in patients with persistent PCR negativity,

residual tumor cells (if they exist) are clearly under stable and
possibly lifelong control. The present study is the ﬁrst randomized trial to include prospective MR monitoring. It is important
to note that only 22% of the patients were excluded from
molecular analysis because of a lack of adequate sampling. Our
study indicates that MR is the most important outcome predictor
in multivariate analysis for EFS, PFS, and DFS, and is deﬁnitely
superior to any other indicator available at diagnosis. In
addition, this study establishes a direct link between molecular
and clinical outcomes: patients who remain PCRϩ have a bad
outcome regardless of the treatment arm, in contrast to those
who achieve MR. Thus, achievement of MR should be consid-

ered to be key in developing novel treatment strategies for FL.
Finally, these results clearly indicate that the time has come to
evaluate the beneﬁt of using bcl-2/IgH PCR as a decisionmaking tool in FL.
