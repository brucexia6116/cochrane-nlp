background: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)
during ovarian stimulation. Use of GnRH antagonist in the general subfertile population is associated with lower incidence of OHSS than
agonists and similar probability of live birth but it is unclear if this is true for patients with PCOS. Our aim was to compare the ﬂexible
GnRH antagonist and GnRH agonist long protocols in patients with PCOS undergoing IVF (primary end-point: ongoing pregnancy rate
per patient randomized).
methods: In this randomised controlled trial (RCT), <n>220</n> patients with PCOS were randomly allocated in two groups: long GnRH agonist
down-regulation protocol (n ¼ 110) and ﬂexible GnRH antagonist protocol (n ¼ 110).
results: No differences were observed in ongoing pregnancy rates [50.9 versus 47.3%, difference 3.6%, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI):
29.6 to þ16.8%] in the agonist and antagonist protocols, respectively. Incidence of OHSS Grade II was lower in the antagonist compared
with agonist group (40.0 versus 60.0%, difference 220.0%, 95% CI: 27.1 to 232.9%, P , 0.01). Duration of stimulation (10 versus 12 days,
difference 2 days, 95% CI: þ1 to þ2, P , 0.001) and total gonadotrophin required (1575 versus 1850 IU, difference 2275 IU, 95% CI: 225
to 2400, P , 0.05) were also lower in the antagonist compared with agonist protocol.

conclusions: The current RCT suggests that the ﬂexible GnRH antagonist protocol is associated with a similar ongoing pregnancy
rate, lower incidence of OHSS grade II, lower gonadotrophin requirement and shorter duration of stimulation, compared with GnRH
agonist. The GnRH antagonist might be the treatment choice for patients with PCOS undergoing IVF.
The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov. ID: NCT00417144.

Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrinopathy that
affects 5– 10% of women of reproductive age. Despite the development of universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of the syndrome
by the European Society for Human Reproduction (ESHRE) and the

American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) (The Rotterdam
ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group, 2004),
the optimal infertility treatment for PCOS women is still a matter of
controversy. Recently, a consensus was reached on treatment for
PCOS patients, that includes the use of clomiphene citrate, exogenous
gonadotrophins, laparoscopic ovarian surgery and IVF (The

Flexible GnRH antagonist protocol
versus GnRH agonist long protocol
in patients with polycystic ovary
syndrome treated for IVF: a
prospective randomised controlled
trial (RCT)

Materials and Methods
Patient population and study design
This is a single center RCT performed at the Eugonia-Iatriki Erevna IVF unit
from November 2004 to February 2008. Random allocation was performed by a study nurse at consultation, using a computer generated randomization list, in a 1:1 ratio. Patients were treated either by a long GnRH
agonist down regulation protocol (n ¼ 110, agonist group) or by a ﬂexible
GnRH antagonist protocol (n ¼ 110, antagonist group). Neither patients
nor doctors were blinded to the treatment assigned. The study was
approved by our institutional ethics review board. An informed consent
was obtained from all patients included in this study.
Patients could enter the study only once after being diagnosed as PCOS
[presence of oligoovulation/anovulation (Ehrmann et al., 2006) and polycystic ovaries]. Additional inclusion criteria were: age 18 – 39 years, no
endometriotic cyst present, as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound examination, and basal hormonal levels of FSH in the early follicular phase
of 10 IU/ml. Patients with known previous poor ovarian response
(Kolibianakis et al., 2004) were excluded.

Ovarian stimulation
All patients received oral contraceptive pill (OCP) starting on Day 2 of
spontaneous menses of the cycle prior to the treatment cycle, after
blood test conﬁrmed the presence of a baseline hormone proﬁle. The
OCP contained 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (E2) and 0.075 mg gestodene
(Minulet, Wyeth, Greece). OCPs were taken daily for 21 days.
Patients in the agonist group were administered s.c. GnRH agonist
0.1 mg triptorelin (Arvekap, Ipsen, France) daily. The agonist was
started 3 days before discontinuation of the OCP. All patients had
blood loss after discontinuation of the OCP. When desensitization was
achieved (10 – 15 days after the initiation of GnRH agonists), as evidenced by plasma E2 levels of 50 pg/ml, the absence of ovarian follicles
and endometrial thickness 6 mm on transvaginal ultrasound examination
(Barash et al., 1998), daily s.c. injection of recombinant FSH (rFSH,
Puregon, Organon, The Netherlands) was commenced. The dose of
GnRH agonist was decreased on that day to 0.05 mg/day and continued
until and including the day of triggering of ﬁnal oocyte maturation.
In the ﬂexible GnRH antagonist protocol (antagonist group) daily s.c
administration of ganirelix 0.25 mg (Orgalutran, Organon, The

Netherlands) was initiated when at least one of the following criteria
were fulﬁlled: (i) the presence of at least one follicle measuring
.14 mm; (ii) serum E2 levels .600 pg/ml; and (iii) serum LH levels
.10 IU/l (Lainas et al., 2005).
In the antagonist protocol patients started daily rFSH treatment with s.c
injections of follitropin b (Puregon, Organon, The Netherlands), on Day 2
of cycle that followed the discontinuation of the OCP. Treatment with
rFSH and GnRH antagonist continued daily thereafter, until and including
the day of triggering of ﬁnal oocyte maturation.
The starting dose of rFSH was 150 IU/day for all patients in both
groups. This dose was adjusted after Day 5 of stimulation, depending on
the ovarian response, as assessed by E2 levels and ultrasound. As soon
as three follicles reached a mean diameter of 17 mm, 5000 IU of hCG
(Kolibianakis et al., 2007b) (Pregnyl, Organon, The Netherlands) were
administered i.m.

Oocyte retrieval, embryo transfer, luteal
support
Oocyte retrieval was performed 35– 36 h after the hCG injection by transvaginal ultrasound-guided double lumen needle aspiration. ICSI was performed only in cases with severe male factor or previous fertilization
failure. Ultrasound guidance was used for all embryo transfers, which
were performed 2 or 3 days post-oocyte retrieval, depending on the
weekly clinical program (i.e. to avoid embryo transfer on Sundays). Day
2 and Day 3 embryo transfers were equally distributed in the two
groups. Luteal phase support with 600 mg of micronized progesterone
(Utrogestan Laboratoires Besins-International S.A., France) was initiated
2 days after oocyte retrieval.
Embryo transfer was cancelled and elective embryo cryopreservation
was performed in cases of early OHSS, detected 3 days post-oocyte
retrieval, that could possibly lead to life-threatening OHSS (Navot et al.,
1992), or in cases fulﬁlling one or more of the criteria for hospitalization
(The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine, 2004), described below in grade III OHSS.

Classiﬁcation of OHSS
A modiﬁed classiﬁcation system based on combined criteria previously
reported (Golan et al., 1989; Navot et al., 1992; Rizk and Aboulghar,
1999) was used in the current study.
Grade I included patients with no or mild manifestations of OHSS who
did not need any treatment or monitoring as a result of ovarian
hyperstimulation.
Grade II included patients who were not hospitalized as a result of
OHSS and required monitoring on an outpatient basis. These patients
had either (a) moderate OHSS, with discomfort, abdominal pain,
nausea, distension, ultrasonic evidence of ascites, haematocrit (Ht) ,
45%, white blood cells (WBC) , 15 000 (Golan et al., 1989; Navot
et al., 1992; Rizk and Aboulghar, 1999) and enlarged ovaries (maximum
diameter ,10 cm), requiring frequent monitoring, or (b) severe OHSS
requiring daily monitoring, with Ht . 45%, WBC . 15 000, nausea,
abdominal pain, clinical evidence of ascites, marked distension of the
abdomen, marked ascites (Golan et al., 1989; Navot et al., 1992; Rizk
and Aboulghar, 1999) and ultrasound showing large ovaries (maximum
diameter .10 cm).
Grade III OHSS included women who were hospitalized either because
they developed critical OHSS (Navot et al., 1992) (i.e. Ht . 55, WBC .
25 000 and creatinine .1.5), or because they fulﬁlled one or more of the
criteria for hospitalization described by the Practice Committee of the
ASRM (2004). These criteria include severe abdominal pain or peritoneal
signs, intractable nausea and vomiting, severe oliguria or anuria, tense
ascites, dyspnea or tachypnea, hypotension, dizziness or syncope, severe

Group, 2008).
PCOS patients undergoing IVF have a high risk of developing ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (Delvigne et al., 1993), a serious
iatrogenic complication of ovarian stimulation, triggered by exogenous
and/or endogenous hCG. The introduction of GnRH antagonists in
recent years, with a now established decrease in the incidence of
OHSS as compared with GnRH agonists in the general population
(Kolibianakis et al., 2006; Aboulghar et al., 2007), might offer a new
safer treatment option for these patients.
However, in PCOS patients very few studies have been published
comparing agonist and antagonist protocols (Hohmann et al., 2003;
Hwang et al., 2004; Bahceci et al., 2005; Ragni et al., 2005; Lainas
et al., 2007). As a result, available data so far cannot lead to reliable
conclusions (Griesinger et al., 2006).
The aim of the present RCT was to compare the ﬂexible GnRH
antagonist and the GnRH agonist long protocols in a large group of
PCOS patients undergoing IVF treatment, with primary end-point
being ongoing pregnancy rate per patient randomized.

electrolyte imbalance, haemoconcentration and abnormal liver function
tests (The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine, 2004).

Ultrasound and laboratory assays
All ultrasound measurements were performed using a 7.5 or 6 or 5 MHz
vaginal probe (Sonoline Adara, Siemens). FSH, LH, E2 and progesterone
levels were measured using an Immulite analyzer and commercially available kits (DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Analytical sensitivity were
0.1 mIU/ml for FSH, 0.1 mIU/ml for LH, 15 pg/ml for E2 and 0.2 ng/ml
for progesterone. Intra- and inter-assay precision at the concentrations
of most relevance to the current study (expressed as coefﬁcients of variation) were 2.6 and 5.8% for FSH, 5.9 and 8.1% for LH, 6.3 and 6.4% for
E2 and 7.9 and 10% for progesterone, respectively.

Outcome measures

We selected to set the baseline ongoing pregnancy rate for PCOS patients
at 35%, and the detectable difference between groups at 5%, assuming an
alpha level of 0.05. It was calculated that a sample size of 1471 patients
was required in each group to achieve a 0.80 power. In conﬁrmation of
the values used for power analysis, Griesinger et al. (2006) reported
41.6 and 37.1% clinical pregnancy rates in PCOS patients treated by
agonist and antagonist protocols respectively. In addition, Heijnen et al.
(2006) showed that PCOS and control IVF patients achieve similar clinical
pregnancy rates of approximately 35%, a percentage that was also
accepted by The Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus
Workshop Group (2008).
Obtaining such a sample size (1471 patients per group) is not easy to
achieve in a single center, and is also extremely difﬁcult for multicenter
studies, especially when it refers to a small proportion of the population,
such as PCOS patients, even during a 4-year period. Even for a 20% baseline pregnancy rate with 5% difference, more than 900 patients per group
would be required. In addition, detecting a difference of 10% in pregnancy
rates, which is not supported by the data published so far, would still
require a considerable number of patients in each group (n ¼ 376).
Despite this, however, we decided to embark on this trial with the aim
to produce, to the best of our knowledge, the largest comparative trial to
date of GnRH analogues in PCOS patients that could be incorporated in a
future meta-analysis.

Results

Statistical analysis
Proportions were compared with the Fisher’s exact test or the x2 test,
where appropriate. Continuous variables (age, BMI), were compared
with the Student’s t-test for independent samples or the Mann –
Whitney depending on the normality of their distribution. Statistical signiﬁcance was accepted when P  0.05.

Baseline characteristics and hormonal proﬁle of the patients analyzed
are shown in Table I, although Table II shows ovarian stimulation
characteristics and hormonal data on the day of hCG administration.
No signiﬁcant differences were observed between the agonist and the
antagonist group regarding baseline characteristics and hormonal proﬁle.

The primary outcome measure was ongoing pregnancy rate per patient
randomized. Ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy were deﬁned as
the presence of gestational sac with fetal heart beat detection at 12
weeks and at 6 – 7 weeks of gestation, respectively.
Secondary outcome measures were incidence of OHSS, duration of
rFSH stimulation, total dose of rFSH, E2 and progesterone concentration
on the day of hCG administration, cycle cancellation rate, number of
cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) retrieved, number of metaphase II
oocytes and fertilization rates.

The antagonist group was characterized by a shorter stimulation
period [10 versus 12 days, difference 2 days, 95% conﬁdence interval
(CI): þ1 to þ2, P , 0.001], a reduced amount of total gonadotrophin
units required (1575 versus 1850 IU, difference 2275 IU, 95% CI:
225 to 2400, P , 0.05) and a lower E2 concentration on the day
of hCG administration (2144 versus 2850 pg/ml; difference
2706 pg/ml, 95% CI: 2240 to 2841; P , 0.01).
No signiﬁcant differences were observed in ongoing pregnancy rates
[50.9% (56/110) versus 47.3% (52/110)], as well as in biochemical
[68.2% (75/110) versus 62.7% (69/110)], and clinical pregnancy
rates [61.8% (68/110) versus 52.7% (58/110)] between the agonist
and the antagonist group, respectively (Table III). Logistic regression
with the dependent variable ongoing pregnancy, and independent variables the baseline characteristics of patients recruited and type of
stimulation protocol, revealed a signiﬁcant negative (adverse) effect
of the number of previous attempts and BMI on the outcome
(Table IV).
A signiﬁcantly higher proportion of women (55.5 versus 34.5%, P ,
0.001) in the antagonist as compared with the agonist group

developed Grade I OHSS (Table V). Conversely, a signiﬁcantly
greater proportion of women developed grade II OHSS in the
agonist group (60.0 versus 40.0%, P , 0.01).
All patients proceeded at least to oocyte retrieval. Cycle cancellations were therefore equivalent to cancellations of embryo transfer
and elective cryopreservation of all embryos. Cycle/embryo transfer
cancellations were similar in the agonist and antagonist protocol
[ﬁve patients (4.5%) versus four patients (3.6%); Table II].

Discussion
The present study evaluated the comparative efﬁcacy of the ﬂexible
GnRH antagonist and the long GnRH agonist down-regulation protocol in PCOS patients treated for IVF. Ongoing pregnancy rates were
similar in the two protocols, although the GnRH antagonist protocol
was associated with signiﬁcantly lower incidence of Grade II OHSS
(requiring monitoring on an outpatient basis but not necessitating hospitalization), as well as signiﬁcantly higher proportion of women who
did not develop OHSS or developed mild hyperstimulation without

clinical relevance and did not require monitoring (Grade I). In addition,
duration of stimulation and total amount of gonadotrophin units
required were signiﬁcantly lower in the antagonist compared with
the agonist protocol.
The meta-analysis by Griesinger et al. (2006) compared agonist
and antagonist protocols in a total of 305 patients with PCOS and
included four studies. In agreement with the results presented
here, pregnancy rates of 41.5 versus 37% in the agonist and in the
antagonist groups were reported. It must be noted that the
ongoing pregnancy rates reported in the present manuscript (50.9
versus 47.3% for agonists and antagonists, respectively) are higher
than the baseline pregnancy rate (35%) used for the power calculation. Higher pregnancy rates have also been shown in previous
studies in patients with PCOS [57 versus 61% (Kurzawa et al.,
2008); 58.5 versus 57.6% (Bahceci et al., 2005) for agonists and
antagonists, respectively].
It should be noted that the difference observed here in ongoing
pregnancy rates between the groups (3.6%) is below that arbitrarily
accepted as clinically signiﬁcant (5%), and is not statistically signiﬁcant.
However, the 95% CI shows that the current study (although, to the
best of our knowledge, the largest performed in patients with PCOS
comparing the two GnRH analogues) cannot exclude a difference of
29.6 or þ16.8%, which is clinically important. Thus it is likely that
to reject or accept the hypothesis that in PCOS patients the probability of ongoing pregnancy is independent of the analogue used, a
meta-analysis of adequate size is necessary.

In the current study it was shown that the ﬂexible GnRH antagonist
protocol was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower probability of Grade
II OHSS (requiring monitoring on an outpatient basis but not necessitating hospitalization) compared with the GnRH agonist protocol. Our
results corroborate ﬁndings from previous studies in the general population (Kolibianakis et al., 2006; Aboulghar et al., 2007; Lainas et al.
2007), which suggested that the use of GnRH antagonists was associated with a lower probability of OHSS as compared with the use of
GnRH agonists. These observations suggest that use of GnRH antagonists in the treatment of patients with PCOS results in a safer way of
performing ovarian stimulation for IVF.
It is not, however, clear what is the basis of the different occurrence
of OHSS observed between the two groups: this does not appear to
be associated with the number of COCs retrieved (Table II).
However, a signiﬁcantly lower total dose of gonadotrophins was
required and a shorter duration of stimulation was necessary in the
antagonist, as compared with the agonist, group. Despite the similar
number of COCs retrieved in the two groups, it cannot be excluded
that the number of small follicles, which did not yield COCs but contributed to OHSS occurrence, might be associated with the total rFSH
dose administered and/or the duration of stimulation.
The ﬁndings of a decreased total dose of rFSH, of shorter duration
of gonadotrophin stimulation and of lower E2 levels on the day of hCG
administration in the antagonist group, should be read with caution as
this study was not double blind. Nevertheless, these results are in
agreement with those previously published by other groups
(Hohmann et al., 2003; Hwang et al., 2004; Bahceci et al., 2005;
Ragni et al., 2005; Griesinger et al., 2006; Kolibianakis et al., 2007a;
Lainas et al., 2007; Kurzawa et al. 2008).
Increased BMI was shown to have a negative effect on ongoing pregnancy rates, as calculated by logistic regression. This ﬁnding is in agreement with previous studies that reported lower pregnancy rates in
women with high BMI who had been treated with either agonist
(Orvieto et al., 2009) or antagonist protocols (Kolibianakis et al.,
2003).
It should also be noted that the dose of hCG used for triggering ﬁnal
oocyte maturation in the current study was 5000 IU. This choice was
made in order to reduce the occurrence of OHSS in this high-risk
population. Consequently, regarding OHSS occurrence the conclusions drawn in the current study might not be applicable in patients
with PCOS in whom 10 000 IU hCG are used for triggering ﬁnal
oocyte maturation.
Despite the lack of adequate power that would allow solid conclusions to be drawn, this is the largest study to date comparing
GnRH analogues in patients with PCOS. The ﬂexible GnRH antagonist
protocol, as compared with the long agonist protocol, appears to offer

688
similar ongoing pregnancy rates, and is associated with a signiﬁcantly
lower incidence of Grade II OHSS, requiring lower gonadotrophin
amounts and a shorter duration of stimulation. Considering, in
addition, that the antagonist protocol is more patient friendly as compared with the agonist, GnRH antagonists might be the protocol of
choice for patients with PCOS. This, however, remains to be veriﬁed
by a future meta-analysis.
