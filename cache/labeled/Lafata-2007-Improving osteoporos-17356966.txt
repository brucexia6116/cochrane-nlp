BACKGROUND: Despite recommendations, osteoporosis screening rates among women aged 65 years and
older remain low. We present results from a clustered,
randomized trial evaluating patient mailed reminders,
alone and in combination with physician prompts, to
improve osteoporosis screening and treatment.
METHODS: Primary care clinics (n=15) were randomized to usual care, mailed reminders alone, or mailed
reminders with physician prompts. Study patients were
females aged 65–89 years (N=<n>10,354</n>). Using automated
clinical and pharmacy data, information was collected
on bone mineral density testing, pharmacy dispensings,
and other patient characteristics. Unadjusted/adjusted
differences in testing and treatment were assessed
using generalized estimating equation approaches.
RESULTS: Osteoporosis screening rates were 10.8% in
usual care, 24.1% in mailed reminder, and 28.9% in
mailed reminder with physician prompt. Results adjusted for differences at baseline indicated that mailed
reminders significantly improved testing rates compared to usual care, and that the addition of prompts
further improved testing. This effect increased with
patient age. Treatment rates were 5.2% in usual care,
8.4% in mailed reminders, and 9.1% in mailed reminders with prompt. No significant differences were found
in treatment rates between those receiving mailed
reminders alone or in combination with physician
prompts. However, women receiving usual care were
significantly less likely to be treated.

BACKGROUND
Osteoporosis screening for women 65 years and older is
recommended in evidence-based guidelines.1–3 Yet, evidence
exists that less than a third of at-risk women receive bone
mineral density (BMD) testing.4 Thus, a large number of
women are at risk of not receiving needed and known effective
therapy, thereby unnecessarily increasing the burden of
osteoporosis and its consequences.5
Ensuring the receipt of recommended preventive care is one
of the many public health challenges of the 21st century.6
Patient mailed reminders and medical record prompts represent cues to action that have been shown to be effective in
improving preventive health service use.7–13 Such approaches
are advantageous as they enable systematic targeting of patient
populations at minimal costs.14 We present results from a
randomized trial evaluating the extent to which patient mailed
reminders, alone and in combination with physician prompts,
improved osteoporosis screening and treatment rates.

METHODS
Research Design
We used a cluster randomized design in which primary care
clinics, stratified by size and on-site availability of BMD testing,
were randomized to three arms: usual care, patient-mailed
reminders, and patient-mailed reminders in combination with
a physician prompt (Fig. 1). Within stratum, clinics were
allocated to the three arms using a random numbers table.
Patients receiving care from clinics randomized to the two
active intervention arms were observed for one year beginning
on the date their initial patient reminder was sent. Usual care
patients were randomly assigned a pseudo mailing date.

The study was funded by Merck & Co., Inc. The protocol was
approved by the participating medical group’s Internal Review
Board (IRB).

Study Setting and Patient Eligibility
Study patients were selected from among those receiving care
from a large, multispecialty, salaried group practice in southeast Michigan. At the time of the study, the group staffed 23
ambulatory care clinics in the Detroit metropolitan area.
Fifteen suburban clinics staffed by 123 primary care physicians were randomized. Patients available for study inclusion
included both those with insurance coverage via an affiliated
health plan and those with other types of coverage.
Eligible patients included women aged 65–89 years of age on
3/31/2003 with a visit between 4/1/2001 and 3/31/2003 to
a primary care physician (i.e., general internist or family
practitioner). Women were aligned to the primary care physician they saw most often during this time. A visit was required
to enable the patient reminder letter to be sent under the
signature of the patients’ physician. We targeted women aged
65–89 years as they reflect patients for whom osteoporosis
screening most likely was appropriate.
Women with evidence of a previous osteoporosis diagnosis,
BMD screening, or dispensing for an osteoporosis-specific
medication were excluded from the evaluation. Physicians in
the 2 active intervention arms were given the option of
removing any of their patients for whom they felt it would be

inappropriate to receive a mailing. Patients removed by a
physician were excluded from receiving the interventions, but
not from the evaluation (i.e., the evaluation uses an intent-totreat design).

The Patient-Mailed Reminder and Physician
Prompt
Initial and 1-month follow-up patient mailings were sent to
women in the active intervention arms. A third, follow-up
mailing was sent to only those women in the active arms who
received a screening result reflecting a need to consider
osteoporosis treatment (i.e., hip or spine t≤−2.0). Each mailing
included two items: a letter from the individual’s physician and
educational information. Initial letters provided background
information regarding osteoporosis, patient risk factors, and
emphasized the importance of screening. They specified how to
schedule a BMD test and served as a referral form for testing.
The accompanying educational material, while similar in
content across the two mailings, used different formats.
Material in the initial mailing focused on increasing patient’s
perceived susceptibility and addressed common barriers to
BMD testing. The 1-month follow-up included a brochure on
osteoporosis risk, understanding your t score, and protecting
yourself against osteoporosis. Postscreen follow-up mailings,
sent to the subset of women receiving a BMD test result
suggestive of the need for follow up (i.e., hip or spine t≤−2.0),
were sent 3–6 months after testing and recommended sched-

uling a visit with their doctor to discuss BMD screening
results. The accompanying educational material covered osteoporosis injury prevention and tips for keeping bones strong.
Initial mailings were sent in biweekly batches beginning
August 4, 2003 and were completed by December 5, 2003.
The physician prompt consisted of 2 components. First, a
prompt appeared in the electronic medical record (EMR) of all
eligible women receiving care in a clinic randomized to receive
the physician prompt. The second component was a biweekly
mailing to physicians that was sent to coincide with the 3–
6 month postscreen patient mailing. The letter listed the
physician’s patients who received a t score≤−2.0 and indicated
that osteoporosis treatment should be considered.
At the time of the BMD test, all patients, regardless of study
arm, received a printed copy of their test results along with a
standardized written recommendation for follow up based on t
scores.

Primary Outcomes and Data Sources
The primary outcome of interest was the use of BMD testing.
Bone mineral density testing use was determined using CPT-4
codes. Testing use was compiled for the 12-month period after
the date of the first mailing for intervention patients and the
corresponding pseudo mailing date for usual care patients. We
hypothesized that women who received mailed reminders
alone would be more likely to receive a BMD test compared to
women receiving usual care, and that women who received
mailed reminders in combination with physician prompts
would be more likely than those women in either of the 2 other
study arms to receive BMD testing.
A secondary outcome of interest was the dispensing of an
osteoporosis medication. As pharmacy data were not available
for women with health insurance coverage from a source other
than the affiliated health plan, treatment use was evaluated
among the subset of women enrolled in the affiliated health
plan. For these women, health plan pharmacy claims data
were used to compile information on dispensings for raloxifene, alendronate, risedronate, calcitonin (salmon), teriparatide, and ibandronate. For this outcome, we hypothesized that
osteoporosis treatment dispensings would be more likely
among women who received mailed reminders in combination
with physician prompts compared to women in either of the
other 2 study arms.
We also used automated clinical/administrative databases
to compile information on other patient characteristics that
might influence either their osteoporosis risk or their likelihood of treatment. Administrative records were used to
compile demographic information (i.e., age, race, and marital
status) as well as enrollment in the affiliated health plan.
Automated encounter data were used to capture information
on primary care visits, inpatient hospital admissions, associated diagnostic codes (i.e., ICD-9-CM codes), and procedure
use (i.e., CPT-4 codes). Using these latter data, we constructed
variables reflective of the number of primary care visits, and
whether or not the woman was admitted to the hospital,
received a mammogram, or had evidence of a fracture in the
1-year period preceding their mailing/pseudo mailing date.
Finally, for women enrolled in the affiliated health plan, we
used pharmacy claims data to capture dispensings for hormone replacement therapy and steroids during the same 12month period.

Statistical Methods
The unit of analysis for all statistical analyses was the patient.
Differences in patient baseline sociodemographic and clinical
characteristics by study arm were evaluated using analysis of
variance or chi-square tests. Differences in BMD testing and
treatment rates were assessed using logistic regression. In all
instances, generalizing estimating equation (GEE) approaches
were used to account for the non-independence of patients
receiving their care from the same primary care physician and
within the same primary care clinic. Adjusted comparisons
were conducted controlling for patient baseline age, race,
marital status, fracture history, health plan enrollment, and
hospital, primary care, and mammography use. When equations are limited to only those women enrolled in the affiliated
health plan, we also are able to control for hormone replacement therapy and steroid use. Pairwise interactions between
study arm and the other significant included variables were
assessed. Only statistically significant pairwise interactions
were retained.
For the primary outcome of interest (BMD testing), a priori
we estimated power using 75 providers evenly distributed
across the 3 study arms, each with an assumed 140 aligned
patients, and an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.01. This
resulted in an expected power (at an adjusted alpha level of
0.017) of 80% or higher for pairwise comparisons involving
usual care, and an expected power of 74% for the pairwise
comparison between mailed reminders alone and mailed
reminders in combination with physician prompts.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Figure 1 illustrates the number of eligible women by treatment
arm and insurance coverage. Evaluation eligible women (N=
10,354) included 2,901 women receiving care in usual care
clinics, 3,367 women receiving care in mailed reminder clinics,
and 4,086 women receiving care in mailed reminder combined
with physician prompt clinics. Table 1 compares the baseline
characteristics of eligible women by study arm. Although
statistically significant baseline differences were found for
most of the patient characteristics assessed, only a handful
of meaningful differences existed. Women in the patient mailed
reminder arm were less likely to be African American (11.9% vs
16.9% in usual care and 18.5% in the combined patient
reminder/physician prompt arm). We also observed variation
in health plan enrollment, ranging from a low of 57.2% among
usual care patients to a high of 62.0% among those in the
combined patient reminder/physician prompt arm. Finally,
women in the combined intervention arm were substantively
more likely to have received mammography screening (34.8%)
compared to those in the other 2 arms (30.4% in the patient
reminder arm and 29.4% in the usual care arm).
We also compared the characteristics of patients enrolled in
the health plan versus those otherwise insured. Health plan
patients were significantly younger (75.0 vs 76.6 years of age),
had significantly more primary care visits (5.1 vs 3.8), and
were significantly more likely to have had a mammogram (37.5
vs 23.4%), a fracture (4.5 vs 2.6%), or depression diagnosis
(4.3 vs 2.1%).

Unadjusted postperiod screening rates were 10.8% in the usual
care arm, 21.4% in the mailed reminder arm, and 28.9% in the
mailed reminder in combination with physician prompt arm (p<
0.001). Among those tested, the rate of abnormal findings (i.e.,
hip or spine t score≤−2.0) did not differ significantly by study
arm (p=0.104), and was 16.2% in usual care, 17.8% in the
mailed reminder arm, and 13.7% in the mailed reminder in
combination with physician prompt arm.
Table 2 presents the adjusted postperiod BMD testing rates.
Because we found a statistically significant interaction between study arm and participant age, the table presents
adjusted rates by study arm and three illustrative ages: 65,
75, and 85 years. As illustrated in the table, the interventions
significantly improved the use of BMD testing, although
differentially by age, with improvements increasing with age.
With the exception of prior fracture and race, other patient
factors controlled in the model were also significantly (p<0.05)
associated with BMD screening use. BMD screening use was
significantly greater among married patients (OR=1.21, 95%
CI 1.08–1.35), those enrolled in the health plan (OR=1.85,
95% CI 1.63–2.10), and those with a history of mammography
use (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.97–2.39). We also found BMD
screening use to increase with increasing primary care visit
frequency (OR=1.19, 95% CI 1.14–1.24) and to decrease with
the number of hospital admissions (OR=0.74, 95% CI 0.68–
0.82). Appendix Table 3 presents full model results.

Unadjusted osteoporosis treatment rates among eligible women with a BMD test were 5.2% in the usual care arm, 8.4% in
the mailed reminder arm, and 9.1% in the mailed reminder in
combination with physician prompt arm. As illustrated in
Table 2, regression adjusted results also indicated that
women receiving their care from one of the 2 active intervention arms were significantly more likely to have been dispensed an osteoporosis medication than those receiving usual
care. We found no significant difference in the likelihood of
treatment between those women receiving the mailed reminder and those receiving it in combination with the physician
prompt. The only other factor significantly associated with
treatment was marital status. Appendix Table 4 presents full
model results.

DISCUSSION
The use of mailed patient reminders appears to hold promise
for improving osteoporosis screening and treatment rates.
Our findings indicate that the use of mailed reminders
significantly increased osteoporosis screening rates among
insured women. Furthermore, such reminders worked particularly well among women of advanced age: Compared to those
receiving usual care, we found 85-year-old women to be 2.5
times more likely to receive BMD testing when receiving mailed
reminders, whereas those aged 75 were just under twice as
likely. The addition of a physician prompt lead to further
improvements in screening use, with women aged 85 being
almost five times as likely to receive testing and those aged 75
just over 3 times as likely compared to usual care. Thus,
whereas we found mailed patient reminders, alone or in
combination with physician prompts, to improve screening
rates, we found this effect increased with patient age—or among
exactly those women at the most risk.
An estimated 8 million women aged 50 and over suffer from
osteoporosis in the United States alone,5,15 with an estimated
50% of postmenopausal women suffering from an osteoporosis-related fracture during their lifetime.16–18 Such fractures
have a significant impact on health status,19,20 and the US
healthcare system.21 Despite such facts, BMD screening rates
for women at risk for osteoporosis are low. Even among women
with a recent fracture, BMD testing rates have been found to

350

JGIM

Lafata et al: Improving Osteoporosis Screening

range from a low of 1% to a high of only 32%.4,14,22 Estimates
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) further reveal that whereas 11% of women report
having osteoporosis, 26% actually test positive for the disease.5
Recent reviews only add to concerns, highlighting the gap between those with disease and those receiving treatment23 Such
findings are particularly troubling, as estimates of the number
needed to screen to prevent an osteoporotic fracture are reasonable (i.e., 248 for vertebral fracture and 741 for hip fracture).24
The need for a more effective approach to osteoporosis
screening is clear. Yet, only 3 previously published efforts have
evaluated osteoporosis screening programs using a randomized design,25–27 and findings from these efforts have been
mixed. Wroe and colleagues found positively stated patient
messages (vs negatively stated ones) to improve BMD screening rates.26 Stock and colleagues found the use of long (vs
short) reports provided to physicians to also improve BMD
screening use.27 However, Solomon and colleagues found
patient mailed reminders to have no effect on self-reported
BMD screening use among Medicare enrollees.25 Rigorous
evaluations of efforts to improve osteoporosis treatment rates
are similarly uncommon and have likewise produced mixed
results.23,28–30
Whereas the use of patient mailed reminders alone led to
increases in BMD testing rates, the addition of physician
prompts further improved testing rates, thereby illustrating
the potential of reminders and prompts combined to improve
osteoporosis screening rates. The interventions evaluated here
also led to significant, albeit small, improvements in treatment
rates among those tested. We, however, did not find an
additional advantage of physician prompts for treatment.
Treatment gaps and the challenges in closing them previously
have been documented.31
Despite our findings that the use of mailed reminders, either
alone or in combination with physician prompts, can improve
osteoporosis screening rates, we found screening rates—even
among those women receiving both interventions combined—
remained far below optimal among this insured population.
Among women receiving patient-mailed reminders in combination with physician prompts, we found under a third of
women were tested and this dropped to just over 10 percent
among those patients in usual care. Thus, the need to develop
and evaluate other programs, either alone or in combination
with reminders and prompts, to improve osteoporosis screening and treatment among at risk populations remains critical.
Care should be taken when generalizing these findings to
other populations. Our findings are among insured women receiving primary care within 2 suburban regions of an integrated delivery system. Although this population is similar in
demographics to the larger population in southeast Michigan,
they may differ from those receiving care in urban areas, those
residing in other geographic areas, or in other unmeasured
ways. Of particular note is the need to be careful generalizing
our findings to non-insured women. Furthermore, the integrated delivery system may afford advantages and opportunities
(such as an electronic medical record and centralized appointment scheduling) that might limit the feasibility of implementing such programs in other settings. Also of note is that at the
time of the study, prescription drug coverage was not commonplace among the elderly. How the new Medicare benefit
will impact osteoporosis treatment in general is not known.
Finally, despite our ability to control for a number of patient

characteristics, patients could have varied in unmeasured
ways (such as health and functional status, health behavior,
or income/education) among the 3 study arms.
As computer technology becomes more available within
health care settings, many primary care practices will be able
to use clinical informatic tools to monitor the receipt of routine
services and facilitate the implementation of automated reminder and prompt systems. The use of such patient-mailed
reminders and in-office prompts previously has been associated with improved screening performance.7–13 This study
demonstrates the benefit of these tools—particularly when
used in combination—to improve BMD screening rates.
