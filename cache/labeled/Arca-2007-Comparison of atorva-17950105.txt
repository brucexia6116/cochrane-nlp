Abstract
Statins and fibrates have different effects on lipid abnormalities of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL); thus, the selection of the
first-line drug is troublesome. We evaluated to what extent monotherapy with a potent statin is more effective than fibrate in reaching the
recommended lipid targets in FCHL. <n>Fifty-six</n> patients were randomized to receive optimal dosage of atorvastatin (n = 27) or 200 mg/d
micronized fenofibrate (n = 29) for 24 weeks. To reach the optimal dosage, atorvastatin was up-titrated at each follow-up visit if low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol N130 mg/dL (N100 mg/dL in patients with coronary or cerebrovascular disease). The effects of fenofibrate and
atorvastatin on lipoprotein fractions as well as on plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and adrenomedullin (AM) were also evaluated. At end
of trial, a greater proportion of patients on atorvastatin (average dosage, 20.8 mg/d) reached lipid targets in comparison with those on
fenofibrate (64% vs 32.1%, P = .02). Atorvastatin was significantly more effective in reducing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
apolipoprotein B, and non–high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Conversely, triglycerides decreased and HDL increased more during
fenofibrate. Nevertheless, atorvastatin produced a marked reduction in very low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein
remnants. Atorvastatin lowered all LDL subtypes, although fenofibrate appeared to be more effective on denser LDL. Compared with
43 normolipemic controls, FCHL patients presented increased baseline plasma levels of ET-1 (P = .007) but not of AM. Fenofibrate, but not
atorvastatin, significantly lowered ET-1 levels by 16.7% (P b .05). Neither drug significantly affected plasma concentrations of AM. In
summary, although fenofibrate showed superiority in raising HDL and reducing ET-1, atorvastatin was more effective in reaching lipid
targets in FCHL so that it can be proposed as the first-line option in the management of this atherogenic hyperlipidemia.

1. Introduction
Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is a common
atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by elevated concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRLs) (mainly
very low-density lipoprotein [VLDL]) and/or low-density
lipoproteins (LDLs) [1-3]. Other features of FCHL are

increased concentration of apolipoprotein (apo) B and the
preponderance of small dense LDL subfractions (sdLDL)
[4]. Current guidelines recommend lowering both LDL
cholesterol (LDL-C) and TGRL to reduce cardiovascular
risk in these patients [5].
The first-line drug for FCHL patients is still uncertain.
Statins are very effective in reducing LDL-C, but do not
always correct increased TGRL [6]; on the other hand,
fibrates markedly lower plasma total triglycerides (TGs), but
modestly lower total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C [7]. Given
that combination therapy with statin plus fibrate confers an
increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [8], a

M. Arca et al. / Metabolism Clinical and Experimental 56 (2007) 1534–1541

possible alternative might be to use more potent statins.
Atorvastatin is one of the most potent statins [9], and its
efficiency in reducing TGRLs has also been demonstrated
[10]. However, the dosage of atorvastatin that is effective in
most FCHL patients has not been clearly established.
Besides their effects on blood lipid levels, the ability of
these drugs to influence additional vascular risk factors may
be relevant for the selection of the optimal treatment. It has
been noted that FCHL patients present abnormalities in the
endothelial function [11,12]. Several factors have been
associated to endothelial dysfunction, the most investigated
of which is the endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) [12,13].
Endothelin (ET-1) acts as the natural counterpart to the
endothelium-derived NO. In fact, ET-1 has been demonstrated to inhibit endothelial NO release, thereby impairing
endothelium-dependent relaxation and promoting atheroma
formation [14]. Few data are available in humans on changes
in plasma levels of ET-1 during atorvastatin or fenofibrate
therapy. More recently, attention has been focused on
adrenomedullin (AM). It is a vasodilator peptide having a
wide range of biological actions such as reduction of
oxidative stress and inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis
[15]. Overexpression of AM suppressed intimal thickening,
fatty streak formation, and perivascular hyperplasia in rodent
models for vascular remodeling or atherosclerosis [16]. No
data about the influence of atorvastatin and fenofibrate on
plasma levels of AM are available.
We designed this study with the primary aim of
comparing the efficacy of fenofibrate vs the optimal LDLlowering dosage of atorvastatin in reaching lipid targets in
patients with FCHL. To identify the optimal dosage of
atorvastatin, its daily dose was titrated up to 80 mg/d
according to attaining LDL-C b130 mg/dL (or b100 mg/dL
in patients with coronary or cerebrovascular disease). As an
additional objective, the ability of these 2 drugs to correct
lipoprotein abnormalities in FCHL was also compared.
Finally, we took the opportunity of this drug trial to evaluate
the effects of fenofibrate and atorvastatin on plasma levels of
ET-1 and AM.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
Patients between 30 and 75 years old with diagnosis of
FCHL were selected for the study. They were enrolled from
FCHL kindreds identified in the framework of a genetic
study on this hyperlipidemia. The FCHL status
was diagnosed according to previously reported criteria
[17-19]. Briefly, FCHL-affected individuals were required to
have TC and/or TG levels greater than or equal to that of ageand sex-specific 90th Italian population percentiles, and/or
hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, defined as isolated elevation
of plasma apo B concentrations (N130 mg/dL corresponding
to the 90th Italian population percentile). Only families with
at least 2 affected members presenting different lipid

1535

phenotypes were enrolled. Individuals with type III hyperlipidemia, diagnosed by the presence of a broad β band on
electrophoretogram and apo E-2/E-2 genotype, were
excluded. Family members were tested twice for plasma
lipids during ad libitum diet and were considered affected
only if both samples were greater than cutoff values. Other
acquired causes of dyslipidemia were ruled out by standard
laboratory tests. Individuals with obesity (body mass index
N30 kg/m2) or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (blood
glucose N120 mg/dL and/or glycosylated hemoglobin
N6.0%) and those taking lipid-affecting drugs were excluded.
2.2. Study design
The study was designed as a randomized, open-label trial.
Eligible patients entered a washout phase where they were
instructed to maintain a standard lipid-lowering diet for
6 weeks before the baseline blood analysis. Thereafter, they
were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg atorvastatin
or 200 mg micronized fenofibrate daily. Follow-up visits that
included clinical assessment, blood drawings, and compliance evaluation were scheduled at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks.
In the atorvastatin group, drug dosage was doubled at each
visit (up to 80 mg/d) if LDL-C levels remained N130 mg/dL
(or N100 mg/dL in patients with coronary or cerebrovascular
disease). Conversely, in the fenofibrate group, the dosage of
200 mg/d remained unchanged throughout the treatment
period. Compliance to drug treatment was evaluated by
counting returned pills and expressed as percentage of taken
over scheduled doses.
Sample size was estimated assuming a 2-sided level of
statistical significance of .05, 80% power, and a betweengroup difference of responders of 100%. This resulted in a
requirement of 30 subjects for each treatment group.
The study was approved by the institutional Ethical
Committee, and all subjects gave written informed consent to
participate into the study.
2.3. Lipid, lipoprotein, and apo measurements
Blood samples were collected early in the morning after
an overnight fast in EDTA-containing tubes. Plasma was
obtained by centrifugation at 4°C and added with EDTA
(0.04%), NaN3 (0.05%), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(0.015%) to prevent lipoprotein modification. Some aliquots
were immediately used, and others were stored at −80°C for
future measurements.
Plasma and lipoprotein fractions were assayed for TC and
TG using enzymatic reagents, and HDL-C was determined
as reported [17]. Total protein content of lipoprotein
fractions was assayed by a modified Lowry's procedure
[20]. Lipoproteins were isolated from fresh plasma by
sequential ultracentrifugation as described [21]. Briefly,
plasma samples (4 mL) were spun at 40 000 rpm at 10°C for
16 hours to isolate VLDL and intermediate-density lipoprotein fraction (density, b1.019 g/mL), for 18 hours for light
LDL (density, 1.019-1.035 g/mL), and for 20 hours for dense

The AM and ET-1 measurements were performed in
duplicate on frozen samples at the end of the study.

LDL (density, 1.035-1.068 g/mL). It has been reported that
light LDL included predominantly LDL-I and LDL-II
particles (N25.5 nm) and dense LDL included predominantly
LDL-III particles (b25.5 nm) [21].
Total plasma apo B, apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I),
apolipoprotein A-II (apo A-II), and Lp(a) were measured
by an immunoturbidimetric method (Kone Instruments,
Espoo, Finland). To avoid assay drift, these measurements
were performed at the end of the study in one assay.
2.4. Plasma ET-1 and AM measurements
Plasma concentrations of ET-1 and AM were determined
in 47 FCHL patients (21 randomized to atorvastatin and 26
to fenofibrate) on blood sample obtained at baseline and after
6 and 24 weeks of treatment. Forty-three normolipemic
subjects were included as controls (mean age, 57.0 ± 5 years;
TC, 149 ± 21 mg/dL; and TG, 138 ± 20 mg/dL). Plasma ET-1
was determined by a specific radioimmunoassay using rabbit
anti-endothelin-1 antibody (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) according to a previously described method
[22]. Interassay and intraassay variabilities of ET-1 measurements were 13% and 9%, respectively. Adrenomedullin was
measured by using commercially available radioimmunoassay (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Mountain View, CA) as
previously described [23]. The intraassay and interassay
coefficients of variation were 5.1% and 12%, respectively.

2.5. Other laboratory methods
Serum creatinine, uric acid, and the other safety
parameters were determined during the lipid-lowering
treatment using the standard laboratory methods. Apolipoprotein E genotype was determined as reported [17].
2.6. Statistical analysis
For the purpose of the present analysis, only baseline, 6week, and 24-week lipid and lipoprotein values are reported.
Data are expressed as mean ± SD or as percentages
where appropriate.
For all efficacy analyses, a modified intention-to-treat
model was used that included all randomized and treated
patients with a baseline and at least one valid on-treatment
measurement. Missing values were replaced using the “last
observation carried forward” technique. Within treatment,
parameters were compared by using Student t test for
paired data; mean changes from baseline and their 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were also calculated. Categorical
variables were analyzed by χ2 test. Comparison between
treatment groups was performed by the analysis of
covariance method, and sums of squares type III were
used. Baseline value of the response variable was
considered as a covariate.
Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney test) were used to
compare parameters showing skewed distribution. To
describe association between variables, correlation coefficients were calculated by using Pearson's test. A logistic
regression analysis including, age, sex, baseline lipid
parameters, apo E genotype, and treatment as independent
variable was carried out to identify factors predicting the
response to therapy.
All analyses were performed using SAS Software (version
8.02, TS level 01M0; SAS, Cary, NC). A probability value of
less than .05 was taken as statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Participant enrollment and characteristics
Four patients withdrew consent during the washout phase;
and therefore, 56 patients were randomized to treatment.
Their clinical characteristics are reported in Table 1.
Twenty-seven patients received atorvastatin and 29
fenofibrate. Their baseline clinical characteristics did not
differ significantly in all tested parameters (data not
shown). Two patients in either group prematurely interrupted the study, one for acute myocardial infarction and
one for creatine phosphokinase increase in the atorvastatin
group, and one for sudden death and one for mild
elevation of hepatic transaminases in the fenofibrate group.
Atorvastatin at the dosage range of 10 to 40 mg/d allowed
reaching LDL-C targets in all FCHL patients so that none

3.2. Effects of treatments on plasma lipids and lipoproteins

Fig. 1. Percentage of FCHL patients reaching the therapeutic goals during
atorvastatin and fenofibrate treatment. Results of the intention-to-treat
analysis in 27 patients on atorvastatin and 29 on fenofibrate. Therapeutic
goal is defined as LDL-C b130 mg/dL (or b100 mg/dL in patients with
coronary or cerebrovascular disease) and TG b200 mg/dL. At week 24, the
average dosage of atorvastatin was 20.8 mg/d and that of fenofibrate was
200 mg/d.

required 80 mg/d. In particular, 10 patients (40.0%)
maintained the starting dose of 10 mg/d, 9 patients
(36.0%) received 20 mg/d, and 6 (24.0%) received a
dose of 40 mg/d. At week 24, the average dose in the
atorvastatin group was 20.8 mg/d. Compliance to test drug
was comparable in the treatment groups (94.6% [range,
73.8%-102%] in the atorvastatin group and 96.5% [range,
83.4%-100.6%] in the fenofibrate group).
Body weight did not change during fenofibrate, whereas
during atorvastatin, it showed a slight but significant increase
at week 24 compared with baseline (74.7 ± 10.7 kg vs 73.8 ±
9.4 kg, P b .05). Plasma creatinine remained unchanged in
the atorvastatin group, whereas it showed a significant
increase in the fenofibrate group (from 1.05 ± 0.2 mg/dL at
baseline to 1.18 ± 0.2 mg/dL at week 24, P b .001).
However, no patients presented values greater than 1.3 mg/
dL (data not shown).

At week 24, 16 patients (64.0%) in the atorvastatin group
and 9 (32.1%) in the fenofibrate group reached the
recommended lipid targets; and this difference was statistically significant (P = .02) (Fig. 1). Compared with
fenofibrate, atorvastatin was more effective in obtaining
therapeutic successes also at 10 mg/d (40% vs 31.2% at week
6); but the difference did not reach statistical significance
(P = .552) (Fig. 1).
Treatment was considered successful when LDL-C b130
mg/dL (or b100 mg/dL in patients with coronary or
cerebrovascular disease) and TG b200 mg/dL. After
applying the LDL-C b100 mg/dL cutoff also to diabetic
patients, a more pronounced difference in the percentage of
responders was seen between treatment groups (64.0% in
atorvastatin vs 28.6% in fenofibrate, P b .01). Moreover,
when patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG
N400 mg/dL; 4 on fenofibrate and 3 on atorvastatin) were
excluded from the analysis, the between-group difference in
responders was only marginally affected (P b .03).
In the logistic regression analysis, the assignments to
atorvastatin (positively at P = .014) and baseline TGs
(negatively at P = .009) were the only variables predicting
the therapeutic response (data not shown). We determined
that baseline TGs b300 mg/dL was associated with the
highest probability (odds ratio = 8.5; 95% CI, 2.3-15.3; P b
.001) to correct lipid profile during treatment.
Table 2 reports the effects of both medications on lipids,
apoproteins, and other biochemical parameters. Total
cholesterol and LDL-C showed a statistically significant
decrease in both treatment groups (P b .001 at any time
point). However, atorvastatin was significantly more effective than fenofibrate in reducing both TC and LDL-C levels.
In fact, the mean percentage changes of TC from baseline to

atorvastatin (P b .001). Both treatments also significantly
improved non–HDL-C (P b .001 at any time point), but the
between-group difference was of borderline significance
(Table 2). Conversely, in the fenofibrate group, HDL-C
showed a significant increase at any time point, whereas no
substantial changes were observed in the atorvastatin group.
After 24 weeks of treatment, the mean percentage changes of
HDL-C were +15.8 ± 25.3% with fenofibrate and +2.0 ±
15.5% with atorvastatin group, resulting in a significant
14.2% treatment difference in favor of fenofibrate (P = .008).
During fenofibrate, TGs showed a significant reduction at
any time point, whereas in the atorvastatin group, the
decreases were smaller and significant only at week 18 (data
not shown) and at week 24. At this time point, mean
percentage changes from baseline were −27.2 ± 26.2% (P =
.001) in the atorvastatin group and −44.1 ± 20.9% (P = .029)
in the fenofibrate group, resulting in an incremental 15.5%
reduction during fenofibrate (P = .013).
Changes in the absolute concentrations of TGRL and LDL
subfractions are reported in Table 3. After 24 weeks of
therapy, TGRLs appeared to be more favorably affected by
fenofibrate than atorvastatin. In fact, TC and TG in the
density fraction b1.019 g/mL were reduced, respectively, by
50.5% and 54.8% with fenofibrate and by 22.8 and 26.2%
with atorvastatin; and the treatment differences were all
statistically significant in favor of fenofibrate (P = .035 for
TC and P b.001 for TG). Although both treatments decreased
large, buoyant LDL (light and intermediate-dense LDL

subtypes), atorvastatin was significantly more effective than
fenofibrate in reducing concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, and total protein in this LDL subfraction. Conversely,
atorvastatin therapy showed only a modest effect on denser
LDL, whereas fenofibrate resulted in a relative reduction of
this LDL subtype. As evaluated in terms of cholesterol
distribution, fenofibrate determined, at week 24, a shift of
LDL subtypes from dense (−21.9%) to large, buoyant LDL
(+4.2%), whereas atorvastatin produced opposite changes
(+33.8% in dense and −5.8% in large LDL).
Both treatments significantly improved plasma concentrations of apo B (P b .001 at any time point). However, the
difference between treatments was not statistically significant (Table 2). In concordance with changes in HDL-C
levels, fenofibrate significantly increased plasma levels of
apo A-I and apo A-II at any time point, whereas atorvastatin
did not determine any significant variation of these
parameters. After 24 weeks of fenofibrate therapy, apo A-I
increased by 5.2 ± 10.1% and apo A-II by 20.0 ± 14.7%
(Table 2). No significant changes were observed in plasma
concentrations of Lp(a) during either atorvastatin or
fenofibrate treatment. Although fibrinogen showed a slight
but significant increase after 24 weeks of treatment with
fenofibrate, no difference was observed when treatments
were compared (Table 2).
3.3. Effects of treatments on ET-1 and AM levels
Baseline levels of ET-1 were significantly higher in
FCHL compared with controls (10.9 ± 8.0 pg/mL vs 7.5 ±
2.6 pg/mL, P = .007). Conversely, no difference was
observed in plasma levels of AM (16.1 ± 19.1 pg/mL vs
11.4 ± 4.4 pg/mL, P = .59). In the group of FCHL patients,
inverse correlations was found between ET-1 and HDL-C
(r = −0.344, P b .05) and between AM and LDL-C

(r = −0.485, P = .001), apo B (r = −0.404, P = .005), and
HDL-C (r= −0.342, P b .05).
During both treatment regimens, no significant changes
were observed in the plasma levels of AM (Fig. 2A). After
24 weeks of therapy, AM was reduced more by fenofibrate
than by atorvastatin (−21.1% vs −9.7%); but this difference
was not significant. Plasma ET-1 levels were marginally, but
significantly, reduced during fenofibrate (−16.7%, P b .05),
whereas these did not change during atorvastatin (Fig. 2B).

4. Discussion
It is still uncertain whether the first-line treatment of
FCHL should consist of statin monotherapy or fibrate
monotherapy. Other studies have compared atorvastatin and
fenofibrate in mixed hyperlipidemia [24-27], but none have
evaluated the effectiveness of these 2 drugs in obtaining lipid
targets. Here we report that monotherapy with atorvastatin at
the average dosage of 20 mg/d is more effective than 200 mg
micronized fenofibrate in reaching recommended lipid
targets in patients with FCHL. After 24 weeks of therapy,
64% of patients taking atorvastatin reached the therapeutic
targets compared with only 32% of those taking fenofibrate.
The superiority of atorvastatin over fenofibrate was found to
be even more pronounced when more selective lipid targets
were used.
This result was certainly due to the fact that atorvastatin,
when compared with fenofibrate, produced an incremental
reduction of TC, LDL-C, and apo B by 9%, 17%, and 5.8%,
respectively. Although fenofibrate was more efficient in
decreasing TGs, the overall better results observed during

1539

atorvastatin can be also attributable to the beneficial effect of
this statin on the metabolism of TGRL. In agreement with
previous observations [10,28], we found that atorvastatin
significantly lowered VLDL and VLDL remnants and
produced an additional 7.6% reduction of non–HDL-C
compared with fenofibrate. Data from in vivo kinetic studies
may provide the explanation for these effects of atorvastatin
on TGRL metabolism in patients with mixed hyperlipidemias [29]. Besides increasing VLDL apo B removal, this
drug has been demonstrated to reduce hepatic production of
VLDL1 and increase the delipidation of VLDL1. It has been
suggested that these effects of atorvastatin can be ascribed to
the reduction of hepatocellular cholesterol and the stimulation of the LDL receptor pathway. In the same study [29], it
was reported that fenofibrate lowered TGs and VLDL
cholesterol by enhancing delipidation of VLDL1 and VLDL2
and increasing VLDL1 catabolism, but not influencing
VLDL production.
The comparison of atorvastatin and fenofibrate on LDL
composition is relevant because patients with FCHL typically
present increased concentration of atherogenic sdLDL [4].
Atorvastatin and fenofibrate similarly decreased all LDL
subfractions, although atorvastatin was more effective in
lowering large, buoyant LDL (light and intermediate-dense
LDL subtypes) and fenofibrate showed a more pronounced
action on sdLDL. These results are in good agreement with a
number of other studies reporting that LDL subfractions
usually fall in concert with little changes in the size
distribution profile during statin [25,30-33], whereas they
shift composition toward larger LDL subclasses during
fenofibrate therapy [34]. It must be noted that if all LDLs
are atherogenic and if small dense LDLs are particularly
atherogenic, it could be hypothesized that atorvastatin, which
decreases all LDL, is more efficient than fenofibrate, which
preferentially affects sdLDL, in reducing the LDL-dependent
risk of atherogenesis. Indeed, clinical trials have demonstrated
that a reduction in total LDL decreased coronary mortality and
morbidity independently of LDL particle size [35].
Consistent with previous reports [25,32], fenofibrate was
demonstrated to be more effective than atorvastatin in
increasing HDL, thus providing a possible advantage in the
management of FCHL. However, a still unanswered question
is whether raising HDL over LDL may be more efficacious
in reducing risk for CAD [36]. Several major prevention
trials demonstrated that fibrate-induced raising of HDL
significantly reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis
and cardiovascular events [36]. However, it must be noted
that the most part of this benefit is confined to subjects
showing baseline low HDL-C associated with high TG [37],
a phenotype resembling atherogenic dyslipidemia (ALP)
more than FCHL [38]. Moreover, with the only exception of
the Helsinki Heart Study [37], none included patients with
characteristics of FCHL. Finally, recent analyses of intervention trials suggested that raising HDL in patients with
persistently elevated LDL may produce only limited benefits
on cardiovascular risk reduction [39].

An interesting result of our study is that about one third of
FCHL patients failed to reach the therapeutic targets even at
the optimal dose of atorvastatin. We may estimate that this
could be the proportion of FCHL patients requiring
combination therapy. We further found that the lack of
success of therapy was strongly related to the baseline levels
of TG greater than 300 mg/dL. Although this finding may be
biased because of the limited TG-lowering effect of
atorvastatin, it strongly supports the notion that FCHL is a
metabolically heterogenous disorder where a significant
proportion of patients may present defects in hepatic TG
metabolism not modifiable by reducing hepatocellular
cholesterol availability with statins [31] or by activating
peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α–mediated
pathways with fenofibrate [7].
In this study, we have examined whether and to what
extent atorvastatin and fenofibrate may affect plasma
concentration of AM and ET-1, 2 poorly investigated
vasoactive peptides. We found that baseline plasma levels
of AM were not increased in FCHL and that neither
fenofibrate nor atorvastatin significantly influenced them.
Conversely, ET-1 levels were elevated in FCHL; and
fenofibrate, but not atorvastatin, significantly reduced them
already after 6 weeks of therapy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report describing increased ET-1
in FCHL; and it is consistent with previous studies showing
impaired endothelial function in these individuals [11,13].
The effect of statins on plasma ET-1 is controversial.
Previous in vitro studies have shown that statins reduce the
expression of ET-1 in endothelial cells [40]. However,
atorvastatin decreased ET-1 levels in normolipemic diabetic
patients but not in subject at risk of diabetes [41]; and
pravastatin did not change plasma ET-1 in well-controlled
hypertensive individuals [42]. Although these discrepancies
might be due to differences in patients' characteristics, in our
comparison study, we found that only fenofibrate significantly lowered ET-1 levels in FCHL, supporting previous
observations in patients with hypertriglyceridemia [43].
In summary, the results of the present study proved that
atorvastatin is more efficient than fenofibrate in reaching the
recommended lipid targets in FCHL and thus can be
proposed as the first-choice drug in the therapy for this
atherogenic hyperlipidemia. Whether the superiority of
fenofibrate in influencing HDL metabolism and reducing
ET-1 could translate into clinical benefits in FCHL patients
deserves further investigation.
