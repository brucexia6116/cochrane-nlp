Summary:

Patients and methods

The prognosis of metastatic malignant mesenchymal
tumors (MMT) remains poor. Given the chemosensitivity of these neoplasms, a phase II study of high-dose
thiotepa (HDT) was performed to evaluate the efﬁcacy
of this drug in this particular subset of pediatric tumors.
Between 1986 and 1998, <n>18</n> patients, previously treated
with conventional therapy for metastatic or refractory
MMT, entered the study. Thiotepa was administered at
a daily dose of 300 mg/m2 for 3 consecutive days. Hematopoietic stem cell rescue, consisting of bone marrow
transplantation or peripheral stem cell transplantation,
was performed 2 days after completion of HDT. A
response exceeding 50% was observed in 6/18 patients
(response rate 33%). Toxicity was severe but never led
to death. HDT used at a dose of 900 mg/m2 yields
measurable anti-tumor activity in previously treated
patients. The next step in these particularly poor prognosis metastatic MMT will be to investigate HDT combined with other drugs, known to be efﬁcient at high
doses. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2000) 26, 627–632.

Patient characteristics

Metastatic malignant mesenchymal tumors are rare but
have a notoriously poor outcome. In stage IV rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), for example, conventional chemotherapy
combined with local treatment yields a cure rate of approximately 20%. As RMS is a chemosensitive tumor, it was
thought that high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could potentially improve the outcome of patients afﬂicted by these
tumors. The dose–effect relationship is essentially effective
in chemosensitive malignancies. High-dose thiotepa has
yielded signiﬁcant anti-tumor activity in a variety of pediatric solid tumors.1,2 The purpose of this phase II study was
to evaluate the anti-tumor effect of this molecule in pediatric MMT and to describe its potential role in the future
treatment of high-risk MMT in children.

From 1986 to 1998, 18 children treated for a malignant
mesenchymal tumor, entered a phase II study of high-dose
thiotepa (HDT) followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), in four different SFOP centers. All
patients had recurrent disease or lesions that were refractory
to ﬁrst-line conventional chemotherapy. The sex ratio was
11 boys/7 girls. The median age at diagnosis was 10.5 years
(range 2–18.5).
The histologic types were six alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), eight embryonal RMS, two desmoplastic
sarcoma, and two undifferentiated sarcoma.
At the time of diagnosis, disease was classiﬁed as stage
IV in nine patients, stage III in four, stage II in two
and stage I in three (Table 1) according to the TNM
classiﬁcation.3
Before entering this HDT phase II study, all patients had
received conventional chemotherapy with three to 10 different drugs (median six), according to SIOP protocols MMT
75, MMT 84, MMT 89, MMT95.4–7 The primary tumor
(PT) had been resected in seven patients. Three of the seven
excisions had been considered microscopically complete.
In one patient (No. 16) pulmonary metastases had been
resected. Surgery had not been performed when tumors
were unresectable after chemotherapy or when there was
no macroscopic tumor, depending on the protocol applied.
In eight patients, local treatment had also comprised radiotherapy to the primary tumor bed at a median dose of 45.Gy
(range 39–50).
After ﬁrst-line chemotherapy, six patients (Nos 2, 3, 8,
10, 11, 17) had shown no signs of response and were
considered to have primary disease refractory (RD) to
chemotherapy (radiologically evaluated response Ͻ25%).
A partial remission (PR) had been obtained in two patients
with metastatic lesions (Nos 6, 7). The 10 remaining
patients had developed recurrent lesions (from one to six),
after having achieved complete remission (CR) (details for
each patient are given in Table 2).
Treatment of recurrent disease had consisted of secondline chemotherapy for all 10 relapsing patients, surgical
excision of a local recurrence in one patient (No. 9), radiotherapy to the PT in two others (Nos 15, 18) (45 Gy) and
both surgical excision and radiotherapy to the PT in six
patients (Nos 1, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16) (45 Gy). One patient had

(No. 4). Of the 10 relapsing patients, two (Nos 4, 9) had a
refractory recurrence and in two, the sensitivity of the
relapse had not been tested and HDT was the ﬁrst treatment
proposed (Nos 12, 15). The other six patients had sensitive relapses.

Finally, at the time of HDT, four patients were in partial
remission and 14 had progressive disease (progression over
25% at any sites of the disease).
All patients had measurable disease, at the primary site
(ﬁve patients), at metastatic sites (six patients) and at both
sites (seven patients). Metastases were located in the lungs

(seven patients), bone (one patient), lymph nodes (six
patients), central nervous system (one patient), and the
pleura (one patient).
Drug administration and transplantation procedures
Thiotepa was administered at a daily dose of
300 mg/m2/day as a 1-h infusion, for 3 consecutive days
(total dose of 900 mg/m2).
HSCT was performed 2 or 3 days after the end of chemotherapy. Seven patients had an autologous bone marrow
transplantation (ABMT), eight had a peripheral blood stem
cell (PBSC) graft and three patients received both ABMT
and PBSC. PBSC were obtained by leukaphereses and
mobilized using G-CSF administered to patients in steady
state or at recovery following myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
Supportive care
All patients were isolated in a laminar air-ﬂow room and
were ﬁtted with a right atrial catheter on admission to the
transplantation unit. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed, as previously described.8 Platelet and packed red
blood cell transfusions were prescribed to maintain the platelet count Ͼ20 × 109/l and hemoglobin Ͼ70 g/l. All blood
products were irradiated at a dose of 25 Gy before transfusion and CMV-negative products were given to CMVseronegative patients.
Evaluation of response
Tumor response was evaluated 4–6 weeks after transplantation. The aim of the evaluation, using CT scan or MRI,
and/or scintigraphy and/or medullogram, was to measure

changes in the tumor volume at all disease sites, primary
tumor and measurable metastases included. Complete
remission (CR) was deﬁned as no detectable disease, whatever the investigation. A partial response corresponded to
shrinkage of previous volumes exceeding 50%. No
response (NR) denoted an objective effect (OE) which was
deﬁned as a reduction of between 25% and 50%, stable
disease (SD) corresponding to tumor shrinkage of less than
25% and progressive disease (PD).
Results

Tumor response
All patients were evaluable for tumor response (Table 3)
and toxicity.
Of the 18 patients, one achieved CR (No. 18), ﬁve achieved PR (Nos 1, 2, 13, 15, 17), and all the others were
considered as NR (Table 3). Six of 18 patients responded
following HDT attaining a response rate of 33% (95% CI
11% to 55%).
Twelve of the 18 patients received further treatment after
HDT. The patient who entered CR (No. 18) after HDT
relapsed locally 7 months later and is now alive with PD.
Among the ﬁve patients who achieved PR, one (No. 17)
received a second course of HDT with HSCT. In spite of
this treatment, he died of progressive disease 2 months
later. Another patient (No. 13) had resection of lung metastases followed by thoracic radiotherapy and is still considered to have stable disease 16 months later. The three
others (Nos 1, 2, 15) died of progressive disease despite
further surgery in two cases and radiotherapy in one.
Among the 12 non-responders, 10 died of progressive

disease after HDT despite various post-transplantation
treatments over a median of 4 months (range 2–31). Two
patients (Nos 7, 8) are still alive with NED, 63+ and 50+
months post HDT. One received radiotherapy to the primary tumor and the other had additional chemotherapy
including cyclophosphamide and carboplatin and surgical
resection of lung metastases. Thus, four patients are
currently alive, two of them with NED and a duration of
follow-up of 16+, 22+, 50+ and 63+ post HDT.
The overall median time to relapse post HDT was 4
months (range 1–21) with a median follow-up of 8 months
(range 2–63).

Toxicity
No patient died of HDT-related toxicity. Although the toxicity of thiotepa was signiﬁcant, overall tolerance was
acceptable in this study. Myelosuppression was the most
common toxicity observed. The median duration of neutropenia (Ͻ0.5 × 109/l) and thrombocytopenia (Ͻ50 × 109/l)
was 9.5 days (range 2–37) and 30 days (6–140), respectively. According to the current protocol at time of BMT,
12 of 18 patients received G-CSF systematically after the
transplantation procedure: all PBSC recipients, two ABMT
recipients and two patients who received both grafts. The
median duration of G-CSF administration was 13 days
(range 8–20).
The median number of red blood cell and platelet transfusions was two (range 1–4) and four (range 2–13), respectively.
All patients experienced fever during neutropenia for a
median duration of 6 days (range 1–18). In the majority of
cases, its origin remained unknown. A bacterial isolate was
identiﬁed in three cases. Two patients had septicemia due
to Enterobacter cloacae in one case and to Staphylococcus
aureus in the other. One patient had a urine infection due
to Enterococcus. These infections resolved easily with no
complications. The median duration of antibiotic therapy
was 17 days (range 8–35).
No severe hemorrhagic complications occurred during
hospitalisation post SCT. One case of mild hemorrhagic
cystitis was reported that resolved completely.
Two patients experienced acute renal toxicity (tubular
pathology and a decrease in creatinine clearance). These
complications were transient and recovery was complete
and rapid.
Mucositis was observed in 12/18 patients. In seven cases,
this side-effect exceeded grade 2 according to the Bearman classiﬁcation.9
Fourteen of 18 patients experienced vomiting despite
regular prophylactic ondansetron.
Diarrhoea occurred in 13/18 patients and was severe in
eight (three grade III and ﬁve grade II). Treatment led to
anorexia in 15/18 children which was severe in four.
Weight loss was severe (Ͼ10% of body weight) in three
cases.
Four cases of skin toxicity were documented, one of
which was described as lobster syndrome. The patient recovered from this toxicity slowly and there were no late
effects.

Discussion
Although the prognosis of localized RMS has improved
over the last 20 years, with overall survival reaching 60%
to 70%,10 the prognosis of metastatic or recurrent RMS
remains very poor (15–30% according to studies).11–13 The
cure rate of high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma, namely primary
or secondary metastatic disease, parameningeal and
localized tumors refractory to conventional therapy, is
evaluated at around 20%.14 Since RMS is a chemosensitive
tumor, dose escalation is considered a valid option in
attempts to improve the prognosis.
It is well established that cytotoxicity with thiotepa, an
alkylating agent similar to nitrogen mustard, correlates with
the dose administered.15
Geyer et al16 concluded that thiotepa was inefﬁcient in
recurrent malignant pediatric tumors using the maximum
conventional dose (65 mg/m2). High-dose thiotepa, used as
a single agent or combined with other cytotoxics and supported by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),
has been tested in various solid pediatric tumors and the
response rates were encouraging.2,17,18,19 However, no
homogeneous large series has adequately evaluated the
activity of thiotepa in MMT. We previously reported a
phase II study of HDT in various pediatric solid tumors
and some of the patients (Nos 1–7, 9) in the present study
were included in that previous publication.2 The results
obtained were encouraging but the limited size of the population prohibited any ﬁrm conclusions regarding response
rate.
This is the ﬁrst large series evaluating the anti-tumor
activity of HDT in MMT. Response in 6/18 patients (33%)
conﬁrms previous data and demonstrates the efﬁcacy of the
drug used at a high dose in this type of childhood tumor.
Given the small size of the population, no difference in
response rate could be demonstrated in terms of histologic
types. All children who achieved a signiﬁcant response had
metastatic disease at the time of HDT and half of the
responding patients were experiencing a second or further
relapse when they received HDT. The responses observed
are noteworthy since these patients had particularly poor
prognosis disease.
HDT has most often been included in multi-agent highdose chemotherapy regimens.20–22 The main drawback of
such a combination is that drug doses have to be attenuated
to avoid cumulative toxicity.23 Furthermore, these combinations were designed empirically and it has not been
possible to analyse the efﬁcacy of each single agent.
A few other phase II studies using high-dose single
agents in MMT have been reported. Pinkerton et al24 used
HD melphalan and achieved a response rate of 44% in
MMT. Hartmann et al25 also reported a response rate of
44% for RMS with HD melphalan in a phase II study of
pediatric solid tumors. Nevertheless, HD melphalan failed
to have an impact on survival in MMT 4–91 study.13
A phase II study of high-dose methotrexate was conducted in high-risk unresectable or metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and a response rate of 33% (4/12) was
obtained. This study,26 however, investigated ‘up-front window therapy’ and included only previously untreated chil-

dren whose tumors should have been more sensitive to
chemotherapy.
In the present study, thiotepa was used at 900 mg/m2.
This is the maximum tolerated dose,15 but there are no data
available indicating whether a lower dose would yield the
same anti-tumor efﬁcacy or not.
Extra-hematological toxicity of HDT was essentially severe mucositis, that was never life-threatening, but necessitated frequent use of opiates to relieve severe pain. This
side-effect has been well described and is known to be
dose-dependent and to become problematic as soon as the
900 mg/m2 dose is used.15 Despite severe mucositis, no
cases of severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in
this series.
Conversely, cutaneous toxicity was less frequent than
expected. Saarinen et al19 reported the occurrence of
erythroderma in practically every patient at a dose of
1125 mg/m2.
In conclusion, the present series indicates that thiotepa is
an active agent in pediatric malignant mesenchymal tumors
when used at a high dose. Although this HD schedule was
not life-threatening, toxicity remained severe and necessitated intensive care monitoring and adapted supportive
care.
HDT could be used in combination with other agents
demonstrated to be efﬁcient as single agents in phase II
studies. Consolidation therapy of CR patients could therefore be investigated prospectively using combined highdose chemotherapy in patients with particularly poor prognosis stage IV MMT, namely, subjects older than 10
years at diagnosis and/or with bone or bone marrow
metastases.27
