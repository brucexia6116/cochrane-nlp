Abstract
Objective To determine whether patient–physician communication in obstetrics and gynaecology can be improved
by a training program and to investigate if physicians with
poorer performance before the training show greater
improvement in communication skills scores over the
course of the study.
Design Intervention study with randomisation in training
(n = 16) and control group (n = 16) and patient satisfaction
and communication skills of physicians as outcome variables. Physicians’ communication skills were assessed by
independent raters using a standardised evaluation instrument
(adapted version of the MAAS-R) to analyse video recorded
interviews before and after the training. Patient satisfaction
was assessed with a patient satisfaction questionnaire.
Results Using general linear model (GLM) for repeated
measures no group £ time interaction nor time eVects were
found for physicians’ communication skills. No group £
time interaction was found for patients’ satisfaction scores;
however the signiWcant time eVect was mostly attributable
to positive changes in patients’ rating of the training group.
Physicians with poorer performance at the beginning
showed greater improvements over the course of the study,
especially in the training group.

Conclusions In this randomized controlled trial marginal
intervention eVects for the improvement of communication
skills and only partial changes in patient satisfaction scores
from pre to post training were shown. However, physicians
with poorer performance at the beginning showed greater
improvements, suggesting that competence levels were
already relatively high at the beginning of the study. Also,
formation of communication training groups should be
based on speciWc skill deWcits rather than being implemented unspeciWcally for an entire team of physicians.

Introduction
Patient–physician communication in general encompasses
a wide range of interactions, whose quality and content
have been shown to have important eVects on both participants. “Good” communication with patients has been associated in studies of general practitioners and internists with
improved patient adherence, lowered risk of malpractice litigation, improved health outcomes (emotional health,
symptom resolution, function, physiologic measures and
pain control) [1–5]. Quantifying and measuring communication skills has therefore become an important instrument
of quality development in diVerent services especially in
general and internal medicine and teaching communication
skills has become an important part of medical students
training in many countries [6–9]. The patient–gynaecologist communication is characterised by several speciWc features placing great demand on the communication
behaviour of the physician: the health problems presented

123

606

are frequently of intimate nature and have a high emotional
impact. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions inXuence
body image, sexuality and self esteem. Gynaecologists
have to respond to these emotions and personal beliefs and
values of their patients [10].
Reproduction and sexuality are issues that encompass
the patient’s whole life, involving speciWc life cycles and
psychosocial issues. Gynaecologists have to be able to take
a psychosocial, biographical and systemic perspective to
understand their patients [11].
Many healthy women consult with concerns regarding
health maintenance, promotion and health behaviour. They
are not patients in a traditional sense but partners with an
interest in informed decision-making, autonomy and
enhancement of their health related interests and objectives.
Gynaecologists need therefore a speciWc competence in
patient education, information exchange, behavioural change
and negotiation.
These high demands are in rather sharp contrast to the
limited studies on the quality of communication in obstetrical and gynaecological services and the eVect on patient’s
satisfaction [12, 13]. Furthermore the speciWc communicative demands in women’s health care have not yet been
clearly deWned and operationalised and there is a lack of
training programs that take into consideration the needs of
this speciality as described above [14]. Reasons for this discrepancy can be manifold. The daily work load in obstetrics
and gynaecology does not permit to develop a special focus
on communication, because the priority lies on medical or
surgical interventions. Obstetrics and gynaecology being
traditionally a surgical speciality has been less focused on
psychosocial approaches. Communication skills are diYcult to quantify and evaluate and it is therefore diYcult to
obtain scientiWc evidence about possible eVects.
We have therefore developed a research program to
study the possibility to implement a brief communication
skills training program for staV members of a department of
obstetrics and gynaecology, which can be integrated into
the daily work schedule. The eVects of the communication
training on physicians’ communication skills and its eVect
on patient satisfaction were investigated. In addition, it was
investigated if physicians with poorer performance before
the intervention would beneWt more from the training. The
study addressed these questions by means of a controlled
randomised intervention.

Methods
Design
The study was designed as a randomised intervention
study. As outcome variables, communication skills and

123

patient satisfaction were assessed before and after the training by the analysis of videotaped medical consultations and
by questionnaire. The study has been approved by the Ethical Committee of Basel
Sample
Physicians
Power analysis was computed to assess the required sample
size of physicians in order to detect pre- and post intervention diVerences ( -level of 5%, level of power 80%) in
patient satisfaction and in a change of communication skills
scores. Based on the results reported by Kravitz et al. [15],
the required group-size to detect an intervention-eVect in
the patients’ satisfaction scores, the required sample size in
each group was n = 16. To detect a given interventioneVect on the MAAS-R sub-scores, sample size was calculated on the basis of the results reported by Langewitz et al.
[16], and was estimated to be between n = 5 and n = 17 for
the diVerent subscores. Therefore, we planned a total of 32
physicians to participate in the training and control group.
All physicians of the department of obstetrics and gynaecology of the University Women’s Hospital of Basel, Switzerland were recruited for the study with the exception of the
head of department and one of the authors (JB) who participated as a trainer. Participants were randomised to training
group (n = 18) and control group (n = 18) stratiWed for position and gender. Over the course of the study, seven physicians (3 training group, 4 control group) left the department
due to job reasons. Considering the time plan of the study, it
was possible to enter the Wrst three new colleagues in the
study, two of them randomised to control and one to training
condition. However, this resulted in changes in the composition of the study groups: The Wnal training group (n = 16)
consisted of 56.25% of residents and 43.75% staV members
with a mean of years of experience of 6.9 years. The control
group (n = 16) consisted of 50% of residents and 50% of
staV members and their mean of years of experience was
4.6 years. Training and control group therefore did diVer in
years of professional experience (T = 2.7, P < 0.05).
Patients
Interviews were recorded with real patients recruited from
the outpatient department and with simulated patients. Real
patients were asked for participation as they came for their
regular appointment to the clinic. Twenty-two (15.2%) of
the videotapes were made with real patients before the
intervention and 11 (8.6%) were made with real patients
after the intervention.
Simulated patients were trained in their patient roles by
an external trained trainer. Patient scripts were derived

Arch Gynecol Obstet (2007) 276:605–612

from clinical examples described by an experienced clinician and one of the authors (JB).
Description of the intervention
Teaching objectives
Participants should learn to conceive and practice the consultation as a problem solving process with the following
tasks:
• Practice patient centred communication
• Establish and maintain a therapeutic relationship
• Understand the problem of the patient from a biopsychosocial perspective
• Exchange information and educate patients
• Encourage shared decision making.
Structure of the course
The communication skills training was held by three of the
authors. Training literature served as the basis of the development of the intervention while the content was adapted to
the setting of obstetrics and gynaecology. The training program consisted of three diVerent elements: workshops, practice seminars and progress assessment meetings. An initial
one-day workshop aimed at giving the participants the
theoretical background for the consultations and the communicative and interpersonal processes. The theoretical
background of physician–patient communication, diVerent
communication models, general and speciWc communication skills were discussed and summarised in the training
handout containing the relevant elements of the theoretical
background and communication examples. Three half-day
practice seminars were held for 4–5 participants where the
acquired knowledge and speciWc communication skills were
practised (with videofeedback). Role plays and modelling
were used as additional teaching strategies. The last part of
the intervention consisted of Wve to six 1 h supervision sessions for each participant (single setting and small groups)
over a 3-month period. Trainees discussed problems related
to types of communication they have encountered in their
clinical work, and were supervised by the group and the
trainer. Short communication sequences were practised.
Data collection
Communication skills were assessed before (T1) and after
(T2) the training program for the training group while in the
control group skills were assessed at T1 and T2 with no
intervention. Each physician at T1 and T2 performed in
four videotaped Wrst medical encounters. The percentage of
simulated patients was the same in both groups and there

607

were no diVerences in communication skills and patient satisfaction scores in real and simulated patients.
Digital video cameras were installed in the consultation
rooms and videotape sessions were supervised by one of the
authors. Videotaping of real medical encounters was comparable to that of simulated patients. Physicians being videotaped with simulated patients received a prepared “patient
Wle” before the consultation which contained the relevant
patient data comparable to real patient Wles. Training and control group did not diVer regarding length of the consultation.
After the consultation, patients were asked to Wll out a
satisfaction with the consultation questionnaire. Real and
simulated patients were blinded as to whether the physician
belonged to the intervention or the control group.
Instruments
MAAS-R (the revised Maastricht history-taking
and advice checklist)
The MAAS-R [17] consists of diVerent sections, where the
occurrence or quality of certain behaviour is rated: entry,
overall orientation, exploration of reasons for the encounter, structure of diagnostic plan, history taking (medical and
psychosocial), evaluation and giving information, management
plan, and evaluation of the consultation and general evaluation.
The instrument was chosen as an appropriate interview
measure given that it is based on a model of medical interviewing and that it is reproducible in another cultural and
institutional context and has satisfactory inter-rater reliability [18].
MAAS-R provides global scores (mean and SD) that rate
speciWc behaviours or the quality of, e.g., data gathering.
Sum scores result from checklists where the occurrence of
certain behaviour or the mentioning of speciWc information
is marked. The original structure of the instrument was
slightly adapted for the speciality Weld of the study (obstetrics and gynaecology) clustering the original categories in
the sections entry, history taking, mutual problem deWnition, information giving, shared decision making and feedback/termination of the consultation. For data analysis,
single categories were summarized according to the teaching objectives (see Table 1).
In total, six independent raters (advanced psychology
students), blinded for group aYliation were trained to evaluate videotapes of physician–patient interactions at T1 and
T2. Kappa coeYcient was calculated to determine the
degree of agreement between two raters for nominal scaled
items. The coeYcient ranged from 0.57 (moderate agreement) to 1.0 (excellent agreement). Spearman Rho was calculated for the inter-rater agreement of ordinal and interval
scaled items. The coeYcient ranged from 0.69 to 0.94
which again can be classiWed as moderate to very good.

Patient satisfaction
Patients’ perspective of the consultation was assessed by
using an adapted version of the Kravitz questionnaire
focusing on satisfaction [15]. Questions regarding satisfaction with technical skills of the physician were ignored in
the questionnaire which was used in the current study while
three items were added addressing satisfaction with
patient–physician relationship and Wve items additionally
focusing at satisfaction with received information, thus
resulting in a questionnaire of 13 items.
Questions were answered on a Wve-point Likert scale
ranging from “does not apply at all” to “applies very
much”. The scale used in this study showed to have satisfactory reliability criteria with a Cronbach’s Alpha of

123

0.93. For analysis of validity a factor analysis was conducted which provided three factors explaining 75% of
the total variance (KMO-value .89): satisfaction with consultation and patient–doctor relationship (7 items),
expected compliance (3 items) and patient understanding
(3 items).
Statistical analysis
For each physician of the training and the control group,
mean scores were calculated on the basis of the performance in the four videotaped consultation types. This
resulted in one communication score per domain and physician at T1 and T2. In addition, mean patient satisfaction
scores were calculated on the basis of the satisfaction ratings

(pre- to postintervention) £ group (intervention and control
group) interaction are shown in the last column reXecting
no signiWcant interactions in communicative scores. In
addition, inner subject contrasts for the factor time and
post-hoc t tests for group comparison did not reXect any
time or group diVerences in the dependent variables.

in each of the four medical encounters resulting in one
patient satisfaction score per physician.
Means of satisfaction and communication skills scores
were normally distributed. Pre- to post-training eVects were
analysed using a general linear model (GLM) for repeated
measures with a two-folded factor group (training and control group) and a two-folded factor time (pre and post intervention) and innersubject contrasts were calculated to look
for pre–post diVerences in communication and patient satisfaction scores.
In order to investigate if physicians with poorer performance at T1 will show higher improvement in communication skills, in a linear regression analysis communication
skills scores at T1 served as predictors for T2–T1 communication score diVerences.
P values were two-tailed and the level of statistical signiWcance was 0.05. Calculations were performed with the
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 13.

Patient satisfaction scores before and after the training
Table 3 shows satisfaction questionnaire sum scores for the
factors satisfaction with consultation and doctor–patientrelationship, compliance and patient understanding as well
as overall sum score.
In none of the satisfaction scores time £ group interaction was signiWcant, even though the factor time (pre- to
post-intervention) for satisfaction with consultation and
doctor–patient-relationship, (F = 9.33, P < 0.01), compliance (F = 16.16, P < 0.01) and patient understanding
(F = 7.15, P<0.05) showed signiWcant results. The pre- to
post-test changes were mostly attributable to higher satisfaction scores in the training group at post-intervention
(satisfaction with consultation and doctor–patient-relationship: T ¡ 2.50, P < 0.05; compliance: T = ¡3.40, P < 0.01;
patient understanding: T = ¡2.30, P < 0.05) and to a lesser
degree to higher satisfaction scores in the control group at
the second time point of assessment (compliance: T ¡ 2.20,
P < 0.05).

Prediction of improvement in communication skills
by pre-intervention score levels
In a Wrst step, mean scores of pre-to-post training diVerences in communication scores according to the teaching
objectives were calculated for both groups to reXect
changes in communication skills. In a second step, communication scores at T1 served as independent variables to
predict pre-to-post training diVerences in communication
scores in linear regression analysis.
Table 4 displays those variables where a lower performance at T1 was predictive for higher pre–post diVerences
in communication skills scores.
In the training group, lower levels of performance were
followed by higher skill improvements from T1 to T2 in all
of the communication domains indicating that physicians
with poorer performance tended to proWt more from the
training. In the control group poorer performance at T1 predicted higher improvements only in the domains establish
therapeutic relationship, problem understanding and shared
decision making, reXecting intervention independent learning processes in these categories. On the other hand, performances at T1 were not predictive for improvements in the
domains patient centred communication and give information and educate the patient.

Discussion
EVectiveness of the intervention
In this randomised trial only an indirect eVect of a communication skills training for gynaecologists was observed:
while observer based ratings of communicative skills did
not diVer between training and control group from pre to
post intervention, a greater increase in patient satisfaction
scores was noted for the patients of the training group.
Whether the implementation of the training program could
have had an impact on the culture of the institution leading
to model learning, seminal eVects, and cross contamination
among physicians [19, 20] can not be answered because we
would have had to use a control group outside the institution which was not feasible.
Table 4 Linear regression analysis for lower performance at T1
predicting higher improvements
in communication skills scores

Communication domain

The results are in line with the conclusions of the systematic review of Hulsman et al. [21], where studies with
the most appropriate study designs (randomized, controlled), showed the least training eVects. This can partly be
due to the eVect that in randomized controlled trials quality
of pre-intervention communication skills in general is not a
selection criterion, thereby leading to heterogeneous group
compositions.
Improvement of communication skills related
to baseline performance
Therefore, in a second step, we investigated if baseline
communicative skills prior to the intervention are related to
improvements over the course of the study period. The
analysis suggests that physicians with poorer performance
at baseline showed greater improvements over time and this
was especially more pronounced for trainees compared to
controls. This Wnding is inline with the observation of Gunn
et al. [22], who found no improvements in communication
skills in general practitioners with excellent performance
prior to an intervention to detect postnatal problems. In our
study, especially deWcits in the domains patient centred
communication and giving information and educate the
patient were sensitive to training induced changes.
From these results, two basic principles for communication skills trainings can be suggested. First, prior to an
intervention, baseline communication skills should be
assessed leading to an individual proWle of strengths and
weaknesses. Second, interventions should focus at training
speciWc skills more individually rather than being oVered as
a standardized package to a with regard to their communicative competence heterogeneous group of physicians.
Principles of communication skills trainings
So far, three central aspects for the planning and evaluation of training programs for communication skills have
been described: Which aspects of patient–physician communication should be trained, how should they be trained,
and how should training be evaluated [15, 16, 23–25]. In
the literature, there is a considerable number of partially
contradictory skills which are related to the quality of

physician–patient communication [5, 26–28]. However, so
far widely accepted guidelines for communication behaviour only exist for speciWc clinical situations such as
breaking bad news [29, 30].
We chose for our training program teaching objectives
which on the one hand represent the most frequently studied skills and on the other hand seemed to us speciWc for the
needs of patients in obstetrics and gynaecology [31–33].
Communication skills training programs in medicine introduce various teaching techniques and use diVerent didactic
strategies [16, 34–37]. Besides the transmission of declarative knowledge, learning how to communicate is mostly
acquired over procedural learning and only a few teaching
strategies have so far been evaluated in their eVectiveness
for such learning processes [38]. For procedural knowledge
acquisition the trainee optimally is actively involved in the
training situation and is confronted step by step with more
complex problems and techniques. It is central that the
trainee learns when to intervene how [39].
With regard to the issue of evaluating the training program, a wide variety of instruments have been developed
including questionnaires and rating instruments [18]. The
appropriateness of the use of the MAAS-R in this study for
the detection of training eVects in the specialty of gynaecology and obstetrics has to be questioned. In OB/GYN a substantial amount of consultations focus on preventive care,
health counselling, and non-disease related questions. Thus,
the MAAS-R which looks in a large proportion on more
technical rather than interpersonal skills might not have been
the right measure to look for eVects in our training program.
As another limitation of the study, employment Xuctuations lead to group diVerences regarding years of professional experience. Also, even though power analysis
expected a total sample size of N = 32 to have suYcient
power to detect group diVerences, further trials with larger
sample sizes are needed. As one of the results of the present
investigation, studies should focus more extensively on
trainee selection prior to an intervention and provide more
individualized communication skills training. Thus, training research should aim to answer the question of who
should be trained by whom with what intervention to produce which eVects.
