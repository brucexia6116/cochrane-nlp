Previous studies have shown that the regular administration of
short acting ␤-agonists can be associated with adverse effects on
airway caliber and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and that
this may occur through a proinflammatory mechanism. The aim
was to explore possible adverse effects of high-dose ␤-agonist
therapy and to assess any adverse interaction with corticosteroids. We undertook a randomized, crossover study to investigate
the effects of 6 wk of treatment with regular terbutaline (1 mg
four times a day), regular budesonide (400 ␮g twice a day), combined treatment, and placebo in subjects with mild to moderate
asthma. Major endpoints were PD15 saline, PD20 methacholine,
and induced sputum differential cell counts. <n>Thirty-four</n> subjects
were randomized and 28 completed the study. PD15 saline decreased on terbutaline alone compared with placebo treatment
and on combined treatment compared with budesonide alone
(mean fold decrease of 0.57 [95% CI ϭ 0.36, 0.90] and 0.65 [95%
CI ϭ 0.43, 0.97], respectively). PD20 methacholine was not affected by the use of terbutaline either alone or in combination
with budesonide. The percentage of eosinophils in induced sputum increased during terbutaline treatment alone compared with
placebo (median 8.3% versus 4.4%, p ϭ 0.049). The addition of
terbutaline to budesonide did not affect the percentage of eosinophils compared with budesonide treatment alone. These findings support the hypothesis that short-acting ␤-agonists have a
permissive effect on airway inflammation and that when used in
high dose there may be an unfavorable interaction with inhaled
corticosteroids.

Inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting ␤-agonists are very
widely used in the treatment of patients with asthma. The beneficial effects of corticosteroids, which include improvement
in airway caliber, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), and
airway inflammation, are well documented (1). Although shortacting ␤-agonists are undoubtedly safe when used as required
for the relief of acute symptoms, their regular use has been
shown to have adverse effects (2). Continuous use of shortacting ␤-agonist has been associated with deleterious effects
on peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), spirometric values, and
BHR to methacholine, histamine, and allergen (3, 4). The clinical significance of these effects has been widely debated (3, 5).
The adverse changes in BHR have been more readily demonstrated when bronchoconstriction involves indirect cellular
mechanisms (adenosine monophosphate [AMP], allergen) rather
than stimulation of smooth muscle directly (histamine, methacholine) (6–10). These findings have generated the hypothesis

that the regular administration of short-acting ␤-agonist may
have a permissive effect on underlying airway inflammation (4).
The effects of regular short-acting ␤-agonist on airway inflammation have only been investigated in three studies to our
knowledge. In one study, an increase in the total number of
eosinophils and their activation status in bronchial biopsies was
demonstrated (11). In another, no change in bronchoalveolar
lavage cell count or eosinophil cationic protein level (12) was
observed. In contrast, in a third study short-acting ␤-agonist
treatment resulted in a reduction in lymphocyte number with
no change in eosinophil numbers in bronchial biopsies (13).
The combination of short-acting ␤-agonist with inhaled
corticosteroid has not been extensively investigated; however,
there is some evidence to suggest that ␤-agonists may impair
the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids (8, 14, 15).
Clinical interactions between short-acting ␤-agonists and corticosteroids have recently been studied by our group (16). We
found that morning PEFR, FEV1, and BHR to methacholine
were improved with corticosteroid, and that the addition of
regular terbutaline improved clinical indices.
This new study was designed to extend our observations on
the effect of combining short-acting ␤-agonists with corticosteroids, particularly in light of the proposed negative interaction between these two drugs at a molecular level (14). We
wished to examine the effects of short-acting ␤-agonists and
corticosteroids on inflammatory indices in induced sputum,
and to compare the effect of treatment on BHR to hypertonic
saline and methacholine. We hypothesized that regular shortacting ␤-agonist treatment would be associated with increased
airway inflammation and that any such adverse effects would
be more readily detected by assessing BHR to hypertonic saline (indirect cellular mechanism) than to methacholine (direct smooth muscle mechanism).

METHODS
Subjects
Subjects age 16 to 64 yr with mild to moderate asthma for more than
1 yr were recruited. All subjects were atopic (positive skin test to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, mixed grass pollen, or cat pelt), and
demonstrated BHR to methacholine (provocative dose causing a 20%
fall in FEV1 [PD20] or provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in
FEV1 [PC20] Ͻ 8 ␮mol or Ͻ 12 ␮mol if taking inhaled corticosteroid),
but had an FEV1 Ͼ 50% predicted. They also needed to be able to
produce sputum after induction with 4.5% hypertonic saline. Subjects
were excluded if they had any other serious concurrent medical illness, if they had a smoking history of more than 5 pack-years, or if
they had smoked tobacco in the preceding year. Subjects taking more
than 1,500 ␮g of inhaled corticosteroid per day, or who had required
oral corticosteroids during the previous 3 mo, were also excluded. All
subjects gave written informed consent and the study was approved by
the Canterbury and Otago Ethics Committees.

Study Design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, doubledummy, crossover study. During a prerandomization run-in period,
all asthma medications were withdrawn except short-acting bron-

chodilators, together with any intranasal corticosteroid treatment. For
the following 4 wk subjects recorded their peak flow rates and symptoms twice daily in a diary. Provided they did not become clinically
unstable, subjects were then randomized to receive the following
treatments, each for 6 wk: (1) terbutaline Turbuhaler 500 ␮g 2 puffs
four times a day and placebo Turbuhaler 1 puff twice a day; (2) placebo Turbuhaler 2 puffs four times a day and budesonide Turbuhaler
400 ␮g 1 puff twice a day; (3) terbutaline Turbuhaler 500 ␮g 2 puffs
four times a day and budesonide Turbuhaler 400 ␮g 1 puff twice a
day; (4) placebo Turbuhaler 2 puffs four times a day and placebo Turbuhaler 1 puff twice a day.
The trial medication and matching placebos were supplied by Astra Draco, Lund, Sweden. During the treatment periods, subjects
were instructed to use ipratropium bromide 40 ␮g via metered-dose
inhaler (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) for relief of symptoms but
no other asthma medication was permitted except in the event of a severe asthma attack. At the end of each 6-wk period, subjects underwent a combined hypertonic saline challenge/sputum induction procedure. Three to 7 d later, they underwent a methacholine challenge
test. At this visit, study medication for the next period was issued to
the subjects. Whenever possible, the challenge tests were performed
at the same time of day. Study medication and ipratropium were withheld either overnight (for subjects whose challenge tests were conducted in the morning), or for at least 6 h before each challenge test
performed late in the day.
Subjects were monitored closely throughout the study and had 24-h
access to a medical investigator together with an emergency supply of
prednisone tablets and a salbutamol inhaler. In the event of a subject
experiencing an exacerbation sufficiently severe to warrant additional
treatment, they were temporarily withdrawn from the study. Thereafter, if considered clinically appropriate, subjects were reentered
into the next treatment period once their asthma had restabilized.
Subjects had to have discontinued oral and inhaled corticosteroids for
at least 4 wk before they could rejoin the study. Treatment periods interrupted by asthma exacerbations were not repeated.

Measurements
Airway caliber. PEFR were measured twice daily using a mini-Wright
peak flow meter (Clement Clarke Int. Ltd, Harlow, UK) as the highest of three values taken prior to morning and evening study medication. FEV1 was measured using a rolling seal spirometer (Spirotech;
Graseby, Smyrna, GA) and was taken as the highest of three reproducible maneuvers recorded at the end of each treatment period immediately before the saline challenge.
Symptom diary. The following daytime symptoms were documented daily in a diary on a score of 0 to 3: wheeze, breathlessness on
activity, cough, and sputum production. Similarly nighttime symptoms
of nocturnal wakening, wheeze, and cough were recorded. The use of
ipratropium was recorded twice daily.
Hypertonic saline challenge/sputum induction procedure. Baseline
FEV1 was recorded. Nebulized 4.5% saline was generated from an ultrasonic nebulizer (Ultra-Neb 2000; DeVilbiss, Somerset, PA) using
large bore tubing, a large two-way nonrebreathing valve (2700; Hans
Rudolph Inc., Kansas City, MO) and rubber mouthpiece (mean nebulizer output to subjects ϭ 1.6 ml/min). The saline was inhaled for the
following time periods: 0.5, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4 min (modified version of
Iredale and coworkers [17]). FEV1 was measured 1 min after each period of inhalation. Between each inhalation period, subjects rinsed
their mouth with water and were encouraged to cough sputum into a
plastic container. The challenge procedure was stopped if the FEV1
fell more than 20% from baseline, and subjects were given salbutamol
200 ␮g from a metered-dose inhaler via spacer. Spirometry was repeated after 5 min. At this point the inhalation regimen was restarted
in order to collect more sputum, provided the subject’s FEV1 was
greater than 90% of baseline value. The procedure was stopped after
20 min or after an adequate sputum sample had been obtained. The
nebulizer output was calculated by weighing the nebulizer canister before and immediately after the challenge test. The cumulative dose of
saline causing a 15% decrease in FEV1 (PD15 saline) was calculated
by linear interpolation on the log dose response plot.
Methacholine challenge test. BHR to methacholine was measured
using a modified version of the rapid challenge procedure (18). After

measurement of the baseline FEV1, subjects inhaled nebulized 0.9%
saline as a control, followed by a series of doubling doses of methacholine (0.044 to 44 ␮mol taken in one or two breaths), from a Nebicheck dosimeter (P.K. Morgan Ltd, Gillingham, Kent, UK). FEV1
was measured 1 min after each dose, and immediately after this the
subjects inhaled the next dose of methacholine. The test was stopped
when the FEV1 had fallen by greater than 20% from the postsaline
value or when the highest dose had been administered. The cumulative provocation dose of methacholine causing a 20% reduction in
FEV1 (PD20 methacholine) was calculated by linear interpolation between the last two readings on the log dose response plot.
Sputum processing and analysis. The entire expectorated sample
was homogenized by the addition of 1% dithiothreitol (the volume of
1% dithiothreitol added equating to 3 times the weight of the sputum
sample) (Sputolysin; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) (19). The mixture
was then placed in a rocking waterbath at 37Њ C for 30 min to ensure
complete dispersion before being filtered through a 48-␮m nylon
mesh (B&SH Thompson, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The total cell
count, percentage squamous cells, and percentage cell viability (trypan
blue exclusion) were determined using a hemocytometer. An aliquot
was diluted to obtain a concentration of approximately 1 ϫ 105 cells/ml
from which cytospins were prepared (Shandon 2; Shandon Southern
Products Ltd, Runcorn, Cheshire, UK). The remaining sputum mixture was centrifuged at 1,350 ϫ g for 5 min, the supernatant decanted
and frozen at Ϫ80Њ C for future analysis.
Sputum cell counts. Cytospins were stained with May Grunwald
Giemsa and a 400 differential cell count (excluding squamous cells)
was determined in duplicate.

Statistical Analysis
Results were analyzed for all subjects who completed two or more
treatment periods (n ϭ 28). Diary data from the first 2 wk of each
treatment period were excluded to minimize the influence of any
carry-over effect and to remove the need for a washout period. Each
symptom was analyzed as the percentage of symptomatic days or
nights reported during the treatment period. Similarly, the use of ipratropium was analyzed as the percentage of days and nights during
which it was taken.
Normally distributed data (FEV1, PEFR, log PD15 saline, and log
PD20 methacholine) were initially assessed for an overall treatment
effect using a general linear model repeated-measures analysis. If a
significant treatment effect was revealed, further analysis of each of
the six pairwise comparisons using the paired t test was undertaken.
Nonparametric data (percentage of days with each symptom and in
which ipratropium was used and the percentages of each cell type in
sputum) were initially assessed with Friedman’s test, and if appropriate,
analyzed in pairs using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A p value of
Ͻ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Parametric data are plotted as the mean with the least significant difference, nonparametric
data as the median with the interquartile range. All statistical tests were
performed using SPSS version 8.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

RESULTS
Fifty-two subjects were initially recruited to the study. Eighteen of these were withdrawn before randomization because
of deteriorating asthma (11), the inability to produce sputum
(4), social reasons (2), or because a PD20 methacholine was
not achieved (1). The clinical characteristics of the 34 randomized subjects are shown in Table 1. Of these, 28 (82%) completed the study, with four subjects withdrawn on account of
poor asthma control and two for social reasons. As these subjects all withdrew during the first or second treatment periods,
treatment comparisons were only performed on the 28 remaining subjects. During the study proper, six exacerbations
occurred in five of the 28 subjects. Three of these occurred in
the terbutaline alone treatment period, and three in the placebo period. One subject withdrew in the placebo period after
completing the saline challenge test but before the methacholine challenge was performed.

nighttime wakening, cough, sputum production, or breathlessness on activity. The percentage of days and nights with wheeze
decreased on budesonide treatment, when given alone or in
combination with terbutaline (Table 2). The addition of terbutaline to placebo or budesonide did not result in any significant changes. The percentage of days on which ipratropium
was used fell for all three treatments compared with placebo
(p Ͻ 0.04).

FEV1

FEV1 data are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2. FEV1 was higher
on budesonide treatment compared with terbutaline or placebo treatment (ϩ0.31 L, p Ͻ 0.001, and ϩ0.26 L, p ϭ 0.002,
respectively). Similarly, FEV1 was higher on the combined
treatment compared with terbutaline or placebo treatment
alone (ϩ0.17 L, p ϭ 0.019, and ϩ0.12 L, p ϭ 0.042, respectively). FEV1 was lower on combined treatment compared
with budesonide alone (Ϫ0.14 L, p ϭ 0.030). There was a
trend toward a lower FEV1 on terbutaline compared with placebo but this did not reach statistical significance.

* Beclomethasone and budesonide regarded as equivalent.

PEFR

Analysis of the PEFR data on a week-by-week basis revealed
no time trends. Morning PEFR (Table 2 and Figure 1) was significantly higher on budesonide than on terbutaline or placebo
treatment (ϩ19 L/min, p ϭ 0.043 and ϩ17 L/min, p ϭ 0.001,
respectively). Morning PEFR was further increased on combined treatment compared with budesonide alone (ϩ22 L/min,
p ϭ 0.001). There was no significant difference in morning
PEFR between terbutaline and placebo. Evening PEFR (Table 2) was significantly higher on budesonide compared with
placebo treatment (ϩ15 L/min, p ϭ 0.005), and significantly
higher on terbutaline versus placebo treatment (ϩ30 L/min,
p Ͻ 0.001). There was no significant difference in evening
PEFR between budesonide and terbutaline. Combined treatment resulted in a higher evening PEFR than any of the other
treatments (p Ͻ 0.001).

Hypertonic Saline PD15

A PD15 saline was achieved in 88 (82%) of the 107 saline challenge tests conducted during the randomized periods. Linear
extrapolation, equivalent to a further 4 min of saline administration, allowed an additional two cases to be included in the
analysis. For the remaining challenges an arbitrary value of 30
ml (Ͼ maximal calculated PD15 value) was assigned. PD15 saline data are shown in Table 2 and Figure 3. PD15 saline was
higher on budesonide treatment compared with terbutaline or
placebo treatment: 3.99-fold increase (95% confidence interval [CI] ϭ 2.32, 6.88) and 2.32 (95% CI ϭ 1.48, 3.63), respectively. PD15 saline was lower on terbutaline compared with

DISCUSSION
The results of this investigation provide additional data concerning the proinflammatory as well as the anti-inflammatory
effects of the two drug therapies most commonly used in the
management of chronic asthma, namely inhaled ␤-agonists and
corticosteroids. Although it is no longer recommended that
short-acting ␤-agonists be taken regularly, many patients use
short-acting agents frequently in addition to their anti-inflammatory medication. For this reason investigating possible interactions between the two drugs is clinically relevant, and the
design of our study reflected this objective.
The principal finding was that high-dose terbutaline alone
resulted in a significant increase in sputum eosinophils and
BHR to saline when compared with placebo. There were no
significant changes in symptoms, BHR to methacholine, morning PEFR, or FEV1. These data indicate that when given as
monotherapy in our patients, ␤-agonist alone had a proinflammatory effect although no major impact on lung function was
observed.
The effects of regular short-acting ␤-agonists on measurements of lung function and BHR to methacholine, histamine,
and allergen have been reviewed previously (3), although not
all published studies have reported negative effects consistently. The adverse effects of ␤-agonist on more specific measures of airway inflammation have not been studied as extensively. The increase in sputum eosinophils seen in the present
study is in keeping with the results of a previous investigation
in which an increase in both the total number of eosinophils
and their activation status was observed with regular shortacting ␤-agonist (11). Similarly, short-acting ␤-agonist has been
shown to augment the increase in sputum eosinophils and eosinophilic cationic protein observed after allergen challenge (20).
Moreover, the administration of regular short-acting ␤-agonist
to subjects with an early asthmatic response to allergen has
been shown to increase the likelihood of developing a dual
asthmatic response, suggesting a proinflammatory action (21).
In vitro, exposure of blood eosinophils to short-acting ␤-agonist
resulted in a dose-dependent increase in their respiratory burst,
suggesting that short-acting ␤-agonists may affect eosinophil
activation status directly (22).
Terbutaline treatment resulted in increased BHR to saline
but not to methacholine. A similar difference between saline
and methacholine has been observed previously in a study
which examined the effects of regular inhaled salbutamol in
nonasthmatic atopic subjects (23). Short-acting ␤-agonists have
been shown to have a greater effect on BHR when the mechanism of induced bronchoconstriction involves indirect pathways such as allergen rather than direct stimulation of bronchial smooth muscle (6–10). Moreover, the loss of the acute
protective effect of short-acting ␤-agonists during regular
treatment is more obvious using indirect provocation stimuli

such as AMP, than with directly acting nonspecific stimuli
such as methacholine (6). Hypertonic saline is thought to
cause bronchoconstriction via indirect cellular mechanisms,
notably stimulation of mast cells and local sensory nerves (24).
Our data suggest that saline challenge may be a more sensitive
measurement of airway inflammation.
Our study was also designed to test the hypothesis that the
benefits of inhaled corticosteroid might be compromised when
inhaled ␤-agonist was given in combination. When given as
monotherapy, budesonide treatment resulted in a reduction in
sputum eosinophils, a reduction in BHR to hypertonic saline
and methacholine, and improved lung function. These effects
are well-documented in the literature (25–28). The combination of budesonide with terbutaline, however, provided contrasting outcomes. On the one hand, there was no significant
difference in sputum eosinophils with combined treatment
compared with budesonide alone. On the other, combined
treatment appeared to negate the improvement in BHR to saline—but not to methacholine—obtained with budesonide:
PD15 saline on combined treatment was not significantly different from placebo. This pattern of differential effects on
BHR has been noted previously. In a crossover study in 13
asthmatics, Cockcroft and coworkers demonstrated that compared with treatment with budesonide alone, BHR to allergen
but not methacholine was increased when salbutamol was simultaneously administered (8). Similarly, in a parallel group

study of 41 patients, Wong and colleagues found that the protective effect of 2 to 4 wk treatment with budesonide against
allergen challenge was reduced in patients receiving regular
terbutaline (15). In our study, we also observed that FEV1 was
significantly lower on combined treatment than with budesonide alone. This pattern is different from that for mean
morning PEFR, an observation which has been made previously (15, 29). The explanation for these differential effects on
measurements of lung function is unclear.
The clinical relevance of our findings remains uncertain.
Our earlier crossover study did not reveal any adverse changes
in asthma control with terbutaline treatment, either as monotherapy or in combination with budesonide (16). In fact, the
combination of terbutaline and budesonide was ranked best of
the four treatments using a hierarchy of relevant clinical endpoints. In this study, despite the proinflammatory effects of
terbutaline, no clinically important negative effect has been
identified. However, patients recruited into these two studies
were necessarily required to tolerate the withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroid during the run-in period, and thus only
patients with mild asthma were enrolled. It is possible that
the proinflammatory actions of short-acting ␤-agonists may
counterbalance the benefits of inhaled corticosteroid treatment when subjects with more severe asthma are studied, or
when different dose combinations of the two drugs are used,
or when subjects are investigated over longer periods of time.
This might explain the adverse effect on asthma control which
has been observed in some studies despite the use of anti-inflammatory treatment (30, 31). Certainly, our observations reinforce current guidelines that short-acting agents should be used
only “as required,” and ought to prompt clinicians to carefully
review patients whose asthma is poorly controlled and whose
use of ␤-agonist as “reliever” is excessive.
