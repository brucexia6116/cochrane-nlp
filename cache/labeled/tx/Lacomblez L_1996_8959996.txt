Article abstracb-ALS is a progressive motor neuron disease with no effective treatment. The anti-excitotoxic drug
<tx>riluzole (100 mg/day)</tx> has been shown to decrease mortality and muscular deterioration in ALS patients. To confirm and
extend the therapeutic effect of <tx>riluzole</tx>, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international,
dose-ranging (50,
100,200mglday), stratified study in 959 ALS outpatients treated for up to 18 months. Primary efficacy
criterion was survival and the effect of treatment was analyzed before (Wilcoxon and log rank tests) and after adjustment
on prognostic factors (Cox model). Secondary efficacy criterion was disease progression assessed through change in
functional measures. Tracheostomy-free survival rates were: 50.4% (placebo), 55.3% (50mg riluzole) (p = 0.23,
Wilcoxon
test; p = 0.25,log-rank test), 56.8% (100 mg riluzole) (p = 0.05,Wilcoxon test; p = 0.076,log-rank test), and 57.8%
(200 mg riluzole) (p = 0.061,Wilcoxon test; p = 0.075,log-rank test). At the end of the 18-month study, there was a
significant dose-related decrease in risk of death or tracheostomy (p = 0 0 ) Adjustment for baseline prognostic factors
.4.
showed a 35% decreased risk of death with the 100-mg dose compared with placebo (p = 0.002). No significant treatment
effects were detected for the functional assessments. The most frequent dose-related adverse events included nausea,
asthenia, and elevated liver enzyme levels. This study confirms the therapeutic effect of riluzole in a large representative
ALS sample, over an 18-month period. Riluzole is well tolerated and decreases the risk of death or tracheostomy in ALS
patients.

ALS is characterized by a progressive loss of motor
neurons, which generally leads to death within 2 to 5
years after onset of first symptoms.' The cause of
ALS is unknown but glutamate toxicity is one of the
many hypotheses that have been put forward t o
explain the progressive neuronal
<tx>Riluzole
(2-amino-G-(trifluoromethoxy)benzothiazole</tx>, RP
54274) demonstrated neuroprotective properties during preclinical
This activity is thought to
be related to the inhibitory effect of <tx>riluzole</tx> on glutamate neurotransmission.5~8-11
The first clinical trial with <tx>riluzole</tx> in ALS12enrolled
155 patients in a stratified randomized, double-blind,
<tx>placebo</tx>-controlled study. Results of this first trial
showed that riluzole (100 mg/day) significantly improved survival and decreased the deterioration rate of
muscle function over 15 to 21 months follow-up, as
compared with placebo. The aim of the second study
was to confirm the benefit of the 100-mg daily dose of
<tx>riluzole</tx> and to determine whether the benefithisk ratio
could be enhanced by using either 50 or 200 mg/day. In
the following we present a brief outline of the main
report13with complementary aspects of the design and
results of the study.
Methods. The trial design was similar to the first
study.13 This was an international randomized, double-

blind, dose-ranging, <tx>placebo</tx>-controlled, stratified, parallelgroup study. Patients aged 18 to 75,diagnosed as having
probable or definite ALS according to the El Escorial criteria,I4 were eligible. To prevent interference with the main
outcome measures, patients were not eligible if the following characteristics applied: (1) more than 5 years had
elapsed since first symptom; (2)vital capacity was less
than 60% of the predicted value; (3) tracheostomy had
occurred or was pending; (4)serum hepatic enzyme levels
were greater than twice the upper limit of normal (2 X
ULN);(5)incapacitating or life-threatening diseases were
present; or (6) the patient was pregnant. Patients were
also excluded if they had signs of conduction blocks of
motor nerves, renal dysfunction, paraproteinemia, substantial lesions accounting for the clinical signs on imaging
studies (CT or MRI), or signs of dementia.
Patients had to be free from treatments that could possibly interfere with the assessment of therapeutic effect or
possibly potentiate hepatic toxicity at least 4 weeks prior
to entry. To this end a prospective list of allowed and
contraindicated medications was set up (table 1).All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the
study. The study was granted approval by Institutional
Review Boards according to the rules of each country.
Randomization and treatment. Randomization was
stratified according to site of disease onset (bulbar or limb)
and center (n = 3 ) Patients were given placebo or 50 mg,
1.
100 mg, or <tx>200 mg riluzole/day</tx> as identical tablets. Tablets

were taken orally twice daily (morning and evening), before meals. Each patient was required to continue doubleblind <tx>therapy</tx> for 18 months or until the administrative
cut-off date, whichever was the sooner. At the end of that
period, patients were offered the opportunity to receive
<tx>riluzole (100 mg/day)</tx> in an open-label study. The tablets

of <tx>riluzole</tx> and <tx>placebo</tx> were provided by Rhbne-Poulenc
Rorer (Antony, France).
Efficacy criteria. The primary efficacy outcome was defined prospectively as survival during the 18 months
double-blind period or until the final cut-off date. Endpoints for survival were defined as death (from any cause),
tracheostomy, or intubation with artificial ventilation.
Rates of functional deterioration were secondary efficacy criteria. Disease progression was assessed with use of
functional evaluations (muscle testing, modified Norris
limb and bulbar scales)16,16 symptom assessments for
and
fasciculations, cramps, stiffness, and tiredness were based
on the patients’ subjective evaluation using 100-mm
visual-analog scales (table 2). Respiratory function was
monitored with tests of vital capacity and expressed as a
percentage of the expected normal value. Overall clinical
assessment was done with the Clinical Global Impression
of Change scale.
All clinical evaluations were scheduled at entry and a t
2-month intervals except for respiratory function, which
was assessed at entry and every 6 months thereafter.
Safety and off-treatment criteria. Safety assessments
were done through clinical examination and laboratory
findings. Special attention was given to hepatic function
and hematologic evaluations, which were carried out every
2 weeks during the first 8 weeks of treatment and then
every 2 months. If the serum alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) level increased above three times the normal value,

serologic studies for evidence of viral hepatitis (A, B, and C
subtypes) were performed.
Reasons for withdrawal from treatment included the
occurrence of a serious adverse event, an increase in serum
ALT to more than five times the upper limit of the normal
range (>5 x ULN), and withdrawal of the patient’s consent. For the intent-to-treat survival analysis, the status of
withdrawn patients was checked a t regular time points
until their planned end in the study. Patients who withdrew from treatment were not required to continue functional assessment.
Statistical analyses. Relevant demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient population in each group
at entry were assessed for significant imbalance.
For efficacy outcomes, the primary statistical analysis
was performed on the intent-to-treat population, including
all randomly assigned patients followed for 18 months or
until the cut-off date or death. Additional preplanned analyses included: a per protocol analysis (excluding the patients for whom protocol was violated, defined before unblinding), analysis with death as the endpoint (excluding
assisted ventilation as an endpoint to measure survival),
and censoring a t treatment discontinuation (considering
only events that occurred during continuous therapy
within 1month after treatment discontinuation).
Analyses of the drug effect upon survival were done
before (stratified log-rank and Wilcoxon tests) and after
adjustment for prognostic factors (Cox proportionalhazards analysis). Candidate prognostic variables (table 3)
in the model were a priori defined from previous
reports. 12~17-20 The significant variables in the Cox model
were combined in a prognostic score to allow graphic representation. l3 The dose-effect relationship to survival was
also assessed before and after adjusting for the prognostic
factors selected in the model.
Drug effect upon functional measures was evaluated

with the unweighted least-squares method.21For each patient, the repeated measures of the functional scores (muscle testing, limb and bulbar Norris scores) over time were
summarized into slope of change in score, and betweentreatment group differences were compared with variance
analysis.

Results. <n>Nine hundred fifty-nine</n> patients from 31 centers in seven countries (Belgium, n = 22; Canada, n = 68;
France, n = 422; Germany, n = 95; Spain, n = 24; UK, n =
208; USA, n = 120) were enrolled between December 1992
and October 1993. The median double-blind follow-up was
548 days (range, 442-548 days).
There was no statistical difference between the four
treatment groups for any demographic and clinical variable a t entry, both as a whole and within the stratified
groups of site of onset or center.13 Significant differences
between bulbar-onset and limb-onset strata were as expected12:compared with limb onset, patients in the bulbar
onset group were older, had a lower male-to-female ratio, a
shorter disease duration, a lower vital capacity and bulbar
score, but a higher limb and muscle testing score (table 4).
Concomitant medications a t entry and prior participation in therapeutic trials were well balanced among the
four treatment groups (table 5).
For the evaluable population analysis, a total of 37 protocol violations led to the exclusion of 35 patients (3.6%).
Two hundred five patients (21.4%) prematurely discontinued treatment. These patients were evenly distributed
across all treatment groups (20.7% in the placebo group,
20.3% in the 50-mg group, 22.9% in the 100-mg group, and
21.7% in the 200-mg <tx>riluzole</tx> group). For the survival analysis, nine patients were lost to follow-up a t 18 months.
The primary analysis for the effect of the 100-mg <tx>riluzole</tx> dose on survival during the double-blind period
showed a significantly better survival of the treated group

compared with <tx>placebo</tx> (figure 1)(p = 0.05, Wilcoxon test;
p = 0.076, log-rank test). An increased survival in the
<tx>riluzole</tx>-treated patients was apparent after 3 months, significant at 12 months (p = 0.016, Wilcoxon test; p = 0.019,
log-rank test), and the difference remained throughout the
study. The greatest difference in survival was seen a t 9 to
12 months, when 17.5% more <tx>riluzole</tx>-treated patients
were likely to be alive and tracheostomy-free compared
with patients receiving <tx>placebo</tx>. The 200 mglday dose of
<tx>riluzole</tx> showed a similar effect a t 12 months (p = 0.027,
Wilcoxon test; p = 0.021, log-rank test) and 18 months
(p = 0.061, Wilcoxon test; p = 0.075, log-rank test). Results for <tx>riluzole</tx> a t 50 mglday showed a trend in significance at 12 months (p = 0.10, Wilcoxon test; p = 0.089,
log-rank test) and were not significant a t 18 months (p =
0.23, Wilcoxon test; p = 0.25, log-rank test).
When all <tx>riluzole</tx> doses were pooled compared with <tx>placebo</tx> there was a significant effect at 12 months (p = 0.009,
Wilcoxon test; p = 0.006, log-rank test) and 18 months

(p = 0.038, Wilcoxon test; p = 0.048, log-rank test) showing an increased survival in the treated groups (figure 2).
Comparisons of all four treatment groups showed that
there was a significant dose effect on survival a t 12
months (p = 0.005, trend test) and 18 months (p = 0.04,
trend test) (figure 3).
There was no significant treatment by site-of-disease
onset interaction, meaning that the treatment effect was
similar in both groups of patients. An improved survival
rate was seen for the <tx>riluzole</tx>-treated patients in both the
bulbar-onset and the limb-onset groups (see figure 2). Test
of treatment by group-of-countries interaction effect was
not statistically significant, meaning that the drug effect
on survival was homogeneous across groups of countries.
There was no treatment by duration-of-therapy interaction
effect, meaning that the <tx>riluzole</tx> effect was constant over
the 18-month treatment period. Analysis with death as the

Elevated ALT levels (>5 X ULN) accounted for the
majority of treatment discontinuations based on laboratory
adverse events. The frequency and time to onset of elevated ALT was dose-related (table 8). Patients with serum
ALT levels greater than 5 x ULN represented less than
4% in any treatment group. ALT levels returned to less
than 2 X ULN within 2 months of treatment discontinuation. For patients with ALT levels elevated 3 to 5 x ULN,
serum levels decreased within 2 to 6 months under continuous treatment.
During the trial, virtually all patients took a t least one
concomitant medication. The highest frequency of concomitant drug was related to alimentary tract and metabolism
(72.2%),while drugs used for depression, musculoskeletal
system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, or pain
were used by more than 40% of the patients. As a rough
indicator of the high frequency of concomitant medication,
the mean number of concomitant treatments per patient
during the trial period was 6.6 in the overall population
(6.7 in the placebo group, 6.5 for 50 mg <tx>riluzole</tx>, 6.7 for 100
mg <tx>riluzole</tx>, and 6.6 in the 200-mg <tx>riluzole</tx> group). There
was no apparent difference between treatment groups with
regard to concomitant medications in any of the therapeutic subclasses considered (see table 5).

for the 100-mg dose over the trial period was 35% (confidence interval: 15-50%; p = 0.002).13
No statistically significant difference between <tx>riluzoleand placebo</tx>-treated patients was demonstrated on the rate
of deterioration in functional score for manual muscle testing and the bulbar and limb Norris scales.
The number of patients reporting adverse experiences,
and the number of treatment discontinuations related to
either clinical or laboratory adverse experiences, are reported in table 7. Clinical adverse experiences that occurred more frequently in the <tx>riluzole-treated</tx> patients
than in the placebo group were: nausea, asthenia, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, and circumoral paresthesia. Nausea was reported by 12 to 21% of <tx>riluzole-treated</tx> patients
compared with 12% in the placebo group and resulted in
13 patients (1.4%)discontinuing treatment. Asthenia was
reported by 15 to 20% of <tx>riluzole-treated</tx> patients, compared with 12%for <tx>placebo</tx>. Only nine (0.9%)patients with
asthenia discontinued treatment, as these patients were
encouraged to remain in the trial. Dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, and circumoral paresthesia occurred more frequently with 200 mg/day riluzole.

Discussion. Our results confirm the therapeutic
effect of riluzole in ALS patients. Riluzole demonstrated a dose-dependent positive effect on survival.
Results for the present trial were identical to those
reported in the previous study.12 After adjustment
for significant prognostic factors, both studies demonstrated a 35% decrease in risk of death or trache1.0 -

ostomy over an 18-month period for patients given
100 mg/day compared with placebo.
In both studies, broad inclusion criteria were used
to allow a sample of patients representative of the
majority of ALS patients. This study identified the
same prognostic factors as in the previous study.
After adjustment on significant prognostic factors,
the estimate of treatment efficacy was highly significant for all doses of riluzole at both 12 and 18
months. The lack of significance for interaction effects between treatment factor and either time or
site of onset factors means that the efficacy of the
treatment was stable over the 18-month period and
similar in patients with bulbar and limb onset.
A statistically significant 35% decrease in rate of
muscle strength deterioration was observed in the
first study, but the present study could not confirm
this result. The discrepancy between the first and
second studies might have been caused by differences in the duration of drug-induced asthenia in the
two trials. In the first study, many patients discontinued treatment because of asthenia, but their assessment after withdrawal was included in the
intent-to-treat analysis. In our study, patients were
informed that asthenia could be induced by riluzole
and should not be interpreted as disease worsening
or lack of efficacy. As a consequence, asthenia did
not lead to treatment withdrawal. Because this adverse event obviously interferes with functional assessments, this might explain the discrepancy on
functional measures between the two studies.
Overall, the drug was well tolerated and adverse
events did not outweigh the therapeutic effect of riluzole on survival. Gastrointestinal disorders, asthe-

nia, and dizziness were more frequent in the 200-mg
dose. Aminotransferase elevations were more frequent in the 100- and 200-mg groups and were reversible after treatment discontinuation. In the placebo group, 2% of the patient population experienced
more than 5 X ULN transaminase elevation. These
may be related t o the high frequency of unavoidable
concomitant treatments having an hepatic effect.
The high frequency of concomitant medications
during the study, as compared with those at inclusion, reflects the progression of the disease but also
the quality of patient care, which might have been
improved by the trial itself. With regard to the consistency of results, concomitant medication seemed
well balanced between groups. However, for none of
the therapeutic classes prescribed during the trial do
we have information on possible interference with
trial outcomes nor with riluzole efficacy or safety.
Our study unambiguously confirms the therapeutic effect of riluzole in ALS patients on a hard endpoint of survival. Significantly decreased risk of
death or tracheostomy was observed for all doses,
and the 100-mg dosage presented the best benefit-torisk ratio.
