ABSTRACT. Background. Despite growing evidence
of the benefits of prolonged breastfeeding for mother
and infant health, the rate of breastfeeding at infant age
of 6 months remains below the Healthy People 2010 goal.
The greatest decrease in the breastfeeding rate occurs
during the first 4 postpartum weeks. Mothers who discontinue breastfeeding early are more likely to report
lack of confidence in their ability to breastfeed, problems
with the infant latching or suckling, and lack of individualized encouragement from their clinicians in the early
postdischarge period. Observational studies suggest that
primary care physicians can increase breastfeeding rates
through specific advice and practices during routine preventive visits. However, robust scientific evidence based
on randomized, controlled trials is currently lacking.
Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether attending an <tx>early, routine, preventive,
outpatient visit delivered in a primary care physician’s
office</tx> would improve breastfeeding outcomes.
Design. The study was a prospective, randomized,
parallel-group, open trial.
Setting. Participants were recruited at a level 3 maternity facility, with an average of 2000 births per year, in
France.
Participants. A total of <n>231</n> mothers who had delivered a healthy singleton infant (gestational age: >37 completed weeks) and were breastfeeding on the day of
discharge were recruited and randomized (116 were assigned to the intervention group and 115 to the control
group) between October 1, 2001, and May 31, 2002; 226
mother-infant pairs (112 in the intervention group and
114 in the control group) contributed data on outcomes.
Intervention. Support for breastfeeding in the control
group included the <tx>usual verbal encouragement provided by the maternity ward staff members, a general
health assessment and an evaluation for evidence of successful breastfeeding behavior by the pediatrician working in the obstetrics department on the day of discharge,

provision of the telephone number of a peer support
group, mandatory routine, preventive, outpatient visits at
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months of infant age, and 10 weeks of
paid maternity leave (extended to 18 weeks after the birth
of the third child). In addition to the usual predischarge
and postdischarge support, the mothers in the intervention group were invited to attend an individual, routine,
preventive, outpatient visit in the office of 1 of the 17
participating primary care physicians (pediatricians or
family physicians) within 2 weeks after the birth. The
participating physicians received a 5-hour training program on breastfeeding, delivered in 2 parts in 1 month,
before the beginning of the study.
Outcome Measures. The primary outcome was the
prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding reported at 4
weeks (defined as giving maternal milk as the only food
source, with no other foods or liquids, other than vitamins or medications, being given). The secondary outcomes included any breastfeeding reported at 4 weeks,
breastfeeding duration, breastfeeding difficulties, and
satisfaction with breastfeeding experiences. Classification into breastfeeding categories reported at 4 weeks
was based on 24-hour dietary recall.
Results. Ninety-two mothers (79.3%) assigned to the
intervention group and 8 mothers (7.0%) assigned to the
control group reported that they had attended the routine, preventive, outpatient visit in the office of 1 of the
17 primary care physicians participating in the study.
Mothers in the intervention group were more likely to
report exclusive breastfeeding at 4 weeks (83.9% vs
71.9%; hazard ratio: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
1.01–1.34) and longer breastfeeding duration (median: 18
weeks vs 13 weeks; hazard ratio: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.03-1.92).
They were less likely to report any breastfeeding difficulties (55.3% vs 72.8%; hazard ratio: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.620.93). There was no significant difference between the 2
groups with respect to the rate of any breastfeeding at 4
weeks (89.3% vs 81.6%; hazard ratio: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.981.22) and the rate of mothers fairly or very satisfied with
their breastfeeding experiences (91.1% vs 87.7%; hazard
ratio: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.95-1.14).
Conclusions. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that findings might differ in other health care
systems, this study provides preliminary evidence of
the efficacy of <tx>breastfeeding support through an early,
routine, preventive visit in the offices of trained primary
care physicians</tx>. Our findings also suggest that a short
training program for practicing physicians might contribute to improving breastfeeding outcomes. Multifaceted interventions aiming to support breastfeeding
should involve primary care physicians. Pediatrics 2005;

T

he benefits of prolonged breastfeeding for
mother and infant health are documented in a
vast scientific literature.1 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, continuing to Ն1
year with the addition of complementary foods at ϳ6
months of age.2 In its Healthy People 2010 recommendations, the US Department of Health and Human Services sets goals of 75% of mothers breastfeeding exclusively in the early postpartum period
and 50% continuing to breastfeed for at least 6
months.3
The hospital has been a particular focus of efforts
to promote initiation of breastfeeding in the past
decade.4 As a result, large-scale national surveys
indicated that the in-hospital breastfeeding rate
reached the highest level recorded to date in the
United States (69.5% in 2001) and would meet or
exceed the Healthy People 2010 goal of 75% for the
early postpartum period if increases in breastfeeding
continued at the current rate (ϳ2% per year).5 However, the estimates of any breastfeeding at 6 months
of age (from 27.0% to 32.5% in 2001) still fall significantly short of the Healthy People 2010 goal.5,6 The
largest decreases in breastfeeding rates occur during
the first 4 postpartum weeks among different subgroups of mother-infant pairs.7,8 Reasons for early
breastfeeding discontinuation are complicated.
Mothers who discontinue breastfeeding early are
more likely to report a lack of confidence in their
ability to breastfeed,7,8 problems with the infant
latching or suckling,8,9 breast pain or soreness,8,9 perceptions of insufficient milk supply,8,9 or a lack of
individualized encouragement from their clinicians8
in the early postdischarge period.
Many interventions directed at early preventable
breastfeeding problems and relying on peer counselor or nurse follow-up visits at home or in the clinic
have attempted to increase breastfeeding rates. These
interventions occur as an adjunct to routine preventive visits, rather than within them, and have had
generally limited success.10–13 In contrast, the results
of observational studies suggest that support with
breastfeeding problems and promotion of breastfeeding provided by clinicians during routine preventive visits in office settings are associated with
higher rates of exclusive breastfeeding.14 However,
randomized trials testing the efficacy of interventions delivered through existing primary health care
services are currently lacking.8 Such trials are challenging to conduct in the United States because
mothers, health care providers, managed care organizations, and insurance companies have vested interests in early discharge, home or clinic postpartum
follow-up visits, and specific breastfeeding support.
The French health care system differs to some
extent from the US health care system.15 In 2001, the
mean length of stay after normal vaginal delivery
e140

was 4.8 days in France. Newborns benefit from routine, preventive, outpatient visits delivered by a pediatrician or a family physician in an office setting
during the first 6 months of life (ie, at 8 days, and 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months of infant age). The period of
paid maternity leave is 10 weeks after the birth,
extended to 18 weeks after the birth of the third
child. Despite these legal conditions, the prevalence
of breastfeeding was 70.8% in our hospital and 58.1%
at 1 month of infant age.16 The decrease in breastfeeding rates during the first 1 month of life is likely
to be related to a lack of early adequate breastfeeding
support after discharge. Most mothers do not attend
the mandatory preventive outpatient visit at 8 days
of infant age, because it is usually anticipated in the
maternity ward before discharge, for various practical reasons.
The objective of this prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open trial was to determine whether attending <tx>a routine, preventive, outpatient visit delivered in a primary care physician’s office</tx> within 2
weeks after the infant’s birth would improve breastfeeding outcomes. Our primary hypothesis was that
the exclusive breastfeeding rate at 4 weeks would be
increased among mother-infant pairs attending the
routine, preventive, outpatient visit (ie, the intervention group), in comparison with those receiving the
usual postnatal support (ie, the control group). Our
secondary hypotheses were that the rate of any
breastfeeding at 4 weeks, breastfeeding duration, the
proportion of mothers who experienced no breastfeeding difficulty, and the rate of satisfaction with
the breastfeeding experience would be increased
among mother-infant pairs in the intervention
group, in comparison with those in the control
group.
METHODS
Setting
Mother-infant pairs were recruited in the maternity section of
the department of obstetrics and gynecology of the Chambery
Teaching Hospital (Chambery, France), a level 3 maternity facility
where an average of 2000 deliveries per year have taken place in
the past 5 years.

Participants
The study population consisted of mothers who had delivered
a healthy singleton infant (gestational age: Ն37 completed weeks)
and were breastfeeding on the day of discharge. Mother-infant
pairs were considered ineligible and were not enrolled in the
study if the infant was admitted to a neonatal unit or if the mother
was transferred to an intensive care unit, was Յ18 years of age,
was living outside Chambery and its suburbs, refused or was
unable to give consent, was unable to speak French, or was unlikely to complete follow-up monitoring because of psychosocial
problems such as homelessness.

Enrollment and Interventions
Consecutive mother-infant pairs were screened for eligibility
by 2 residents 7 days per week. Eligible mother-infant pairs were
recruited on the day of discharge. They were randomly assigned
either to receive the usual postdischarge support (control group)
or to attend a routine, preventive, outpatient visit in a primary
care physician’s office within 2 weeks after the birth (intervention
group).

Control Group
The mothers in the control group received <tx>the usual verbal
encouragement</tx> to maintain breastfeeding, provided by the maternity ward staff. On the day of discharge, the infant was examined
by the pediatrician working in the department, for a general
health assessment and an evaluation for evidence of successful
breastfeeding behavior. The mothers were also provided with the
telephone number of a peer support group that they could call to
ask questions and request help. They were not required to attend
the mandatory, preventive, outpatient visit at 8 days of infant age,
because it was anticipated in the maternity ward before discharge.
The postdischarge follow-up monitoring consisted of <tx>routine, preventive, outpatient visits in a primary care physician’s office at 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months of infant age</tx>.

Intervention Group
In addition to the usual predischarge and postdischarge support, the mothers in the intervention group were invited to attend
<tx>an individual, routine, preventive, outpatient visit in the office of
1 of the 17 participating primary care physicians, within 2 weeks
after the birth</tx>. The participating physicians were pediatricians or
family physicians practicing in Chambery and its suburbs. They
had attended a 5-hour training program delivered in 2 parts in 1
month before the beginning of the study. We had developed the
training program on the basis of guidelines and review arti-

cles.17–19 It was intended to improve the physicians’ breastfeedingrelated knowledge and counseling skills. The topics covered were
general health assessment, lactation physiology, feeding position
and latch-on assessment, management of common lactation problems (nipple pain, nipple cracks, sore nipples, mastitis, and maternal concern regarding low milk supply), management of infant
problems (insufficient weight gain, breastfeeding jaundice, diarrhea, and dehydration), maternal medication use while breastfeeding, and sources of support. The training program was delivered through lectures, panel discussions, role-playing exercises,
and printed educational materials. It was delivered as a standalone intervention and did not contain any postcourse measures to
change health professionals’ performance.

Randomization
The allocation sequence was generated by the statistical adviser
of the study with random permuted blocks with a block size of 8.
The randomization assignments were unknown to any of the
investigators and were concealed in consecutively numbered,
sealed, opaque envelopes. The 2 residents opened the envelopes
sequentially after the mothers signed the consent forms.

Data Collection
Baseline data on demographic characteristics, clinical variables,
and in-hospital breastfeeding experiences were collected by the 2

residents through chart review and enrollment interviews. The
participating physicians were asked to complete and return a
questionnaire after each routine, preventive, outpatient visit
within 2 weeks after the birth. The data included breastfeedingrelated problems and management of those problems (counseling,
prescribed medications, or additional visits). Mothers in the control and intervention groups were sent a postal questionnaire
when the infants reached 4 and 26 weeks of age, respectively. As
described previously,20,21 we used a postal questionnaire to assess
breastfeeding outcomes and satisfaction with breastfeeding experiences, to limit the risk of observer bias. A stamped addressed
envelope was enclosed with a cover letter encouraging the mother
to complete and return the questionnaire. A second questionnaire
was sent to nonrespondents 10 days later. Nonrespondents to the
second questionnaire were interviewed by telephone by 1 of the
authors.

Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding reported at 4 weeks. Exclusive breastfeeding was defined
as giving maternal milk as the only food source, with no other
liquids (other than vitamins or medications) or foods being given.22 The secondary study outcomes were prevalence of any
breastfeeding reported at 4 weeks, median duration of breastfeeding, breastfeeding difficulties, and maternal satisfaction with the
infant feeding experience, rated on a 4-point, single-item scale.
Breastfeeding was defined as receipt by the infant of any breast
milk. Classification into breastfeeding categories, as reported at 4
weeks, was based on 24-hour dietary recall. Breastfeeding duration was equal to the infant age when the mother completely
stopped breastfeeding and was censored at the time of 26 weeks
for mothers who reported that they were still breastfeeding at that
time.

Sample Size
On the basis of the results of a previous study,16 we expected an
exclusive breastfeeding rate of 70% at 4 weeks among motherinfant pairs in the control group. We estimated that a sample of
108 mother-infant pairs in each group would have 85% power
with a 2-tailed ␣ error of Ͻ.05 to detect a 25% relative increase in
the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 4 weeks (corresponding to a
17.5% absolute increase from 70% to 87.5%). We assumed that
ϳ5% of mothers would be lost to follow-up monitoring; therefore,
we planned to include 115 eligible mother-infant pairs in each
group.

Statistical Analyses
Analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat
principle. Comparisons were performed by using the Student’s t
test for continuous variables and the ␹2 test or Fisher’s exact test,

TABLE 1.

where appropriate, for categorical variables. In the multivariate
analysis, we used a logistic regression model to estimate the odds
ratio of exclusive breastfeeding at 4 weeks associated with the
intervention, after adjustment for maternal age, white-collar employment status, education status, smoking history, parity, prenatal class attendance, epidural anesthesia, gestational age at delivery, infant birth weight, breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth
status, postpartum length of stay, and expected breastfeeding
duration. The risks of breastfeeding continuation over time were
estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared between the 2 groups with the Cox proportional-hazards
model. A 2-tailed P value of Ͻ.05 was considered to indicate
statistical significance. Hazard ratios were reported with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were performed
with Stata 6.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
The study protocol was approved by the Grenoble University
Hospital Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human
Subjects (Comite Consultatif de Protection des Personnes pour la
Recherche Biomedicale), the French Data Protection Agency
(Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertes), and the
Medical Board of Savoie County (Conseil de l’Ordre des Medecins
de Savoie). Written informed consent was obtained from all enrolled mothers.

RESULTS
Study Patients

Between October 1, 2001, and May 31, 2002, a total
of 1080 mother-infant pairs were assessed for eligibility; 231 were eligible, were approached, provided
informed consent, and were randomized (Fig 1). Of
these, 116 were assigned to the intervention group
and 115 to the control group. The baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were similar (Table 1).
Attendance at the Routine, Preventive, Outpatient Visit

Ninety-two mothers (79.3%) assigned to the intervention group and 8 mothers (7.0%) assigned to the
control group reported that they had attended the
<tx>routine, preventive, outpatient visit</tx> in the office of 1
of the 17 primary care physicians participating in the
study (Fig 1). Eighty-seven questionnaires were completed and returned by 13 physicians (range: 1–26
questionnaires per physician). The questionnaires involved 86 mothers in the intervention group and 1
mother in the control group. The mothers attended
the physician’s office visit at 15.2 days of infant age,

on average (SD: 4.2 days). The most frequent breastfeeding-related problems reported by the physicians
were breast pain or soreness (26 cases, 29.9%), jaundice (15 cases, 17.2%), nipple cracks (14 cases, 16.1%),
latching difficulties (6 cases, 6.9%), desire to discontinue (5 cases, 5.7%), oral thrush (3 cases, 3.4%),
mastitis (1 case, 1.1%), insufficient weight gain (1
case, 1.1%), and colic (1 case, 1.1%). The most frequent behaviors reported by the physicians were
counseling (25 cases, 28.7%), providing information
on a peer support group (15 cases, 17.2%), prescribing medications (10 cases, 11.5%), scheduling a subsequent office visit (8 cases, 9.2%), and prescribing a
breast pump (5 cases, 5.7%). No mother-infant pair
was prescribed laboratory tests.
Outcomes

Outcomes were unknown for 4 mother-infant
pairs in the intervention group and 1 mother-infant
pair in the control group (Fig 1). Therefore, data for
112 mother-infant pairs in the intervention group
and 114 in the control group were available for analysis.
At 4 weeks of infant age, the rate of exclusive
breastfeeding was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (Table 2). In
the multivariate analysis, the association between the
intervention and exclusive breastfeeding at 4 weeks
remained significant after adjustment for potential
confounding (adjusted odds ratio: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.18 –
5.03) (Table 3). No first-order interaction terms for
interactions between the intervention group and the
predictors entered in the model were statistically
significant. With the assumption that missing data
were negative outcomes in the intervention group
(n ϭ 4) and a positive outcome in the control group
(n ϭ 1) in the sensitivity analysis, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 4 weeks remained higher, although not significantly different, in the intervention
group, compared with the control group (94 of 116
cases [81.0%] vs 83 of 115 cases [72.2%]; hazard ratio:
1.12; 95% CI: 0.97-1.30). There was no significant
difference between the 2 study groups with respect
to the rate of any breastfeeding at 4 weeks. The
median breastfeeding duration was higher in the
intervention group (18 weeks) than in the control
group (13 weeks) (Fig 2). The mothers in the intervention group were less likely to report any breastfeeding difficulties (Table 2). The main breastfeeding
difficulties reported were breast pain or soreness
(28.6% in the intervention group vs 31.6% in the
control group), not enough milk (23.4% vs 37.7%),
lack of motivation (20.5% vs 30.7%), infant refused

breast (4.5% vs 16.7%), mastitis (2.7% vs 2.6%), and
other or unspecified difficulties (24.1% vs 38.6%).
The rates of mothers reporting fair or high satisfaction with breastfeeding experiences did not differ
significantly between the 2 groups.
DISCUSSION

This prospective randomized trial demonstrates
that, compared with <tx>usual care</tx>, <tx>attending a routine,
preventive, outpatient visit in the office of a primary
care physician by 2 weeks of infant age</tx> is associated
with a significant increase in the rate of exclusive
breastfeeding at 4 weeks (83.9% vs 71.9%) and longer
median breastfeeding duration (18 weeks vs 13
weeks). The benefits of exclusive breastfeeding for
infant health are documented in a vast scientific literature,23 and exclusive breastfeeding is also widely
considered to be a strong predictor of longer breastfeeding duration. Our findings were robust, because
the increase in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding
persisted after controlling for potential confounding
factors in the multivariate analysis (adjusted odds
ratio: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.18 –5.03). The improvements in
breastfeeding outcomes were logically paralleled by
a decrease in the rate of mothers reporting any
breastfeeding difficulties in the intervention group
(55.3% vs 72.8%). This was likely related to the high
level of attendance at the routine, preventive, outpatient visit in the intervention group (79.3%). This
outpatient visit gave the physicians the opportunity
to screen and manage early breastfeeding difficulties
and to prevent early discontinuation. One surprising
finding was that the satisfaction rates were equally
high for the 2 groups, despite a significant difference
in breastfeeding duration (18 weeks vs 13 weeks).
Satisfaction with breastfeeding experiences is probably not entirely determined by the discrepancy between baseline expectations and final outcomes, and
unmeasured psychologic factors may affect baseline
expectations during breastfeeding experiences, a
phenomenon that is called maturation bias.
Evidence-based data suggest that exclusive breastfeeding rates are increased by support for motherinfant pairs.24 Most interventions aiming to support
breastfeeding are time-intensive interventions that
rely on specifically trained nurses or peer counselors
and that occur as adjuncts to routine preventive visits.8 However, offering support in addition to routine
preventive visits has a limited impact on breastfeeding outcomes in developed countries.12,13,25–27 In
contrast, our findings are in accordance with the
results of prior observational studies showing that
support provided by clinicians through specific ad-

regarding breastfeeding, a lack of confidence in their
counseling skills, difficulties in advising mothers
with lactation problems, and limited time to address
breastfeeding issues during preventive visits.14,28
Moreover, substantial gaps in communication between clinicians and mothers regarding breastfeeding may occur during preventive visits.29 Therefore,
we developed a training program on breastfeeding
for pediatricians and family physicians who participated in the study. The successful implementation of
our training program depended on many factors,
including the clinical content, the use of interactive
techniques, and the limited amount of time required
for its delivery within the constraints of busy practices (5 hours, delivered in 2 parts).
Despite the encouraging findings of our study, it
should be noted that the median duration of breastfeeding in the intervention group (18 weeks) was still
less than the Healthy People 2010 goal. Breastfeeding
support provided by the primary care physician during routine preventive visits is likely to have limited
impact, compared with the effects of various barriers
that affect breastfeeding duration negatively, such as
psychologic factors, cultural factors, and return to
work.30 By 18 weeks, only 33.8% of the mothers in
our study had returned to work or school, although
maternity leave ranges from 10 to 18 weeks in
France. This was in accordance with the results of a
prior study conducted in the same area, which suggested that some mothers benefit from extended
leave.20 Specific counseling regarding methods of
breastfeeding after the return to work has been recommended,29 although robust evidence of the effects
of such counseling on breastfeeding outcomes is currently lacking.20 Other approaches, such as part-time
work, are also thought to help mothers combine
breastfeeding and employment.30
The findings of the current study need to be interpreted in the context of its limitations. First, selfselection of motivated clinicians participating in this
study was likely an important factor contributing to
the improvements in breastfeeding outcomes in the
intervention group. Although this trial demonstrates
the efficacy of support for breastfeeding delivered by
the primary care physician through an early, routine,
preventive visit, the effectiveness of this type of support is probably less in daily practice. This issue
deserves additional study, although implementation
trials of breastfeeding support during routine preventive visits would be challenging to conduct in
developed countries.
Second, it was not possible to blind observers in
this randomized, open trial, because of interactions
with mothers during the outpatient visit and assessment of breastfeeding outcomes. Therefore, we used
a postal questionnaire to assess breastfeeding outcomes, to limit the risk of observer bias. Some mothers might have given erroneous information regarding their breastfeeding status at 4 weeks or the
duration of breastfeeding. However, it was unlikely
that misclassification bias in reporting breastfeeding
outcomes differed according to the study group. The
4-week exclusive breastfeeding estimate was based
on 24-hour dietary recall, as in most clinical trials.23

Some mothers who were exclusively breastfeeding at
4 weeks might not have maintained that status since
birth.31 It is interesting to note that these mothers
who did not maintain exclusive breastfeeding since
birth returned to exclusive breastfeeding at 4 weeks,
which is a positive behavior change. Breastfeeding
duration was assessed retrospectively, on the basis of
data obtained at 26 weeks. It has been shown that
reported breastfeeding duration can be considered
accurate, with a long recall period.32 We did not
assess exclusive breastfeeding duration, however,
because 6-month exclusive breastfeeding duration
recall has been shown to be inaccurate.33
Third, our study was conducted in a single setting
and focused on a socioeconomically low-risk population living in a medium-sized city. Moreover, the
organization of health services has been recognized
as a major factor contributing to breastfeeding initiation and continuation.34 These facts may limit the
applicability of our results to other settings or health
care systems. In addition, the mean length of stay
after normal vaginal delivery is much longer in
France than in other Western countries, including the
United States. However, the mean postpartum
length of stay did not differ between the control
group and the intervention group in the current
study, and the mothers enrolled in each group were
still breastfeeding at discharge, a point that supports
the effectiveness of our intervention in improving
breastfeeding outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS

The current study provides preliminary evidence
of the efficacy of breastfeeding support through an
early, routine, preventive visit in the offices of
trained primary care physicians. These findings support the American Academy of Pediatrics policy
statement calling for pediatricians to promote and
support breastfeeding.2 Our findings also suggest
that a short training program for practicing physicians may contribute to improving breastfeeding
outcomes. We recommend that multifaceted interventions aiming to support breastfeeding involve
pediatricians and family physicians in developed
countries with low or intermediate breastfeeding
prevalences.
