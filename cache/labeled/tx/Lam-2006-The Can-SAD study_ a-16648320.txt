Objective: <tx>Light therapy</tx> and <tx>antidepressants</tx> have shown comparable efficacy in
separate studies of seasonal affective disorder treatment, but few studies have directly compared the two treatments. This
study compared the effectiveness of <tx>light
therapy</tx> and an <tx>antidepressant</tx> within a
single trial.
Method: This double-blind, randomized,
controlled trial was conducted in four Canadian centers over three winter seasons.
Patients met DSM–IV criteria for major depressive disorder with a seasonal (winter)
pattern and had scores ≥23 on the 24item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.
After a baseline observation week, eligible patients were randomly assigned to 8
weeks of double-blind treatment with either 1) <tx>10,000-lux light treatment and a
placebo capsule</tx>, or 2) <tx>100-lux light treatment (placebo light) and fluoxetine, 20
mg/day</tx>. <tx>Light treatment</tx> was applied for
30 minutes/day in the morning with a <tx>fluorescent white-light box</tx>; <tx>placebo</tx> light
boxes used neutral density filters.
Results: A total of <n>96</n> patients were randomly assigned to a treatment condition.
Intent-to-treat analysis showed overall

improvement with time, with no differences between treatments. There were
also no differences between the <tx>light</tx> and
<tx>fluoxetine</tx> treatment groups in clinical response rates (67% for each group) or remission rates (50% and 54%, respectively).
Post hoc testing found that <tx>light-treated</tx>
patients had greater improvement at 1
week but not at other time points. <tx>Fluoxetine</tx> was associated with greater treatment-emergent adverse events (agitation,
sleep disturbance, palpitations), but both
treatments were generally well-tolerated
with no differences in overall number of
adverse effects.
Conclusions: <tx>Light treatment</tx> showed
earlier response onset and lower rate of
some adverse events relative to <tx>fluoxetine</tx>, but there were no other significant
differences in outcome between <tx>light
therapy</tx> and <tx>antidepressant medication</tx>.
Although limited by lack of a double-<tx>placebo</tx> condition, this study supports the effectiveness and tolerability of both treatments for seasonal affective disorder and
suggests that other clinical factors, including patient preference, should guide selection of first-line treatment.

S

easonal affective disorder is the term applied to a clinical subtype of mood disorder that consists of recurrent episodes of major depression occurring with a seasonal pattern (1). The most common type of seasonal affective
disorder is winter depression in which patients experience
symptoms of clinical depression during the fall and winter,
with full remission to normal mood (or a switch into mania
or hypomania) during the spring and summer seasons.
Symptoms of seasonal affective disorder include depressed
mood, profound lack of energy, hypersomnia, hyperphagia
with carbohydrate craving, and weight gain (2). Seasonal
affective disorder is also associated with significant impairment in occupational and social functioning (3, 4). Epidemiological studies from Canada and the United States, using diagnostic interviews conducted among random
community samples, have reported winter seasonal affective disorder rates of between 0.4% and 2.7% in the general
population (5–7). There is considerable evidence that seaAm J Psychiatry 163:5, May 2006

sonal affective disorder is effectively treated by daily exposure to bright artificial light, known as <tx>light therapy</tx> or <tx>phototherapy</tx>, and by antidepressant medication.
More than 70 controlled studies of <tx>light therapy</tx> for seasonal affective disorder have been conducted. An early
pooled analysis of over two dozen studies found that
bright <tx>light treatment</tx> was superior to control conditions
(usually dim light) but primarily in less severely ill patients
(8). However, these findings were criticized for methodological limitations, including small sample sizes and
short treatment durations (1–2 weeks) of the included
studies. Subsequently, two randomized controlled trials
with larger sample sizes and longer durations found that
bright light therapy using fluorescent light boxes was superior to plausible placebo control conditions (9, 10). Terman et al. (9) studied 144 patients with seasonal affective
disorder randomly assigned to one of four treatments for
2–4 weeks: 1) morning or 2) evening bright light (exposure

to 10,000-lux <tx>fluorescent light</tx> for 30 minutes) or 3) highdensity or 4) low-density negative ions emitted from a
negative ion generator (the <tx>placebo</tx> condition). Eastman
and colleagues (10) studied 96 patients randomly assigned
to 5 weeks of treatment with morning or evening bright
light (consisting of a 6,000-lux fluorescent light box for 1.5
hours), or morning use of a deactivated negative ion generator (the <tx>placebo</tx> condition). In both studies, bright light
was superior to the <tx>placebo</tx> condition in producing clinical remissions, and morning <tx>light exposure</tx> was superior
to evening on some measures. In addition, three systematic reviews incorporating meta-analyses have also supported the efficacy of <tx>light therapy</tx>, although it was noted
that the treatment duration of included studies remained
relatively short (5 weeks or less) (11–13). This evidence resulted in the recommendation of <tx>light therapy</tx> as a firstline treatment for seasonal affective disorder in expert and
consensus clinical guidelines (14–17).
Antidepressant medications have not been studied as
extensively as light therapy in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) have the best-demonstrated evidence for medication efficacy. In one study, patients with seasonal affective
disorder (N=68) were randomly assigned to treatment
with <tx>fluoxetine, 20 mg/day</tx>, or <tx>placebo for 5 weeks</tx> (18).
The improvement in overall depression scores was not significantly different, but the effect size of 0.5 for fluoxetine
was similar to that found in other antidepressant trials for
nonseasonal depression. In addition, the clinical response

806

ajp.psychiatryonline.org

rate (greater than 50% improvement in depression scores)
for <tx>fluoxetine</tx> was significantly higher than <tx>placebo</tx> (59%
versus 34%, respectively). In the subset of patients who
were more severely ill at baseline, <tx>fluoxetine</tx> did show statistical superiority in improving the overall depression
scores. In a larger study (N=187), <tx>sertraline in a flexible
dose (50–200 mg/day) for 8 weeks</tx> was superior to <tx>placebo</tx>
both in improving depression scores and in the clinical response rate (63% versus 46%, respectively) (19). In both
studies, the SSRI drugs were well tolerated, with few dropouts in any condition (between 3.1% and 7.5%).
Smaller controlled studies have shown that other medications, including moclobemide, L-tryptophan, and hypericum (St. John’s wort), may be effective treatments for
seasonal affective disorder. There have also been case series suggesting that <tx>bupropion, citalopram, reboxetine,
and tranylcypromine</tx> are beneficial (reviewed by Lam and
Levitt [15]).
In summary, both light therapy and antidepressants
have evidence showing efficacy in seasonal affective disorder treatment and are considered first-line therapies. An
important clinical question remains: How does <tx>light therapy</tx> compare with <tx>antidepressant treatment</tx>? There are
few systematic comparisons of <tx>light therapy</tx> versus <tx>antidepressant drugs</tx> in seasonal affective disorder. A singlecase study suggested that <tx>citalopram</tx>, an <tx>SSRI antidepressant</tx>, was as effective as <tx>light therapy</tx> (20). A small randomized controlled trial (N=35) compared bright <tx>light
therapy</tx> (3,000 lux, 2 hours/day) combined with <tx>placebo</tx>
capsules versus <tx>fluoxetine (20 mg/day)</tx> combined with
<tx>placebo light (100 lux, 2 hours/day)</tx> for 5 weeks in patients
with seasonal affective disorder (21). Both conditions produced significant response, with no difference in final depression scores and no difference in clinical response
rates (>50% reduction in depression scores: <tx>light therapy</tx>,
70%; <tx>fluoxetine</tx>, 65%). However, when strict criteria for
clinical remission were used (>50% reduction in depression scores and a posttreatment score within the normal
range), <tx>light therapy</tx> showed a superiority over <tx>fluoxetine</tx>
(50% versus 25%) that approached significance (p=0.10).
In addition, post hoc testing showed that light therapy resulted in significantly lower depression scores after 1 week
of treatment. There were no differences between treatments at other time points. The limitations of this study
were its small size (hence low power to detect differences)
and that the timing of exposure to light (morning, evening,
or morning and evening) was chosen by the patient. In
fact, there was some suggestion that morning light was
more effective, since 10 of 12 patients responded to morning light, compared with two of five for evening light, and
two of three for morning and evening light. Using the
more optimal morning timing of light exposure for all patients may have further added to the superior response
rate of light therapy over <tx>fluoxetine</tx>.
Important questions that remain to be answered for the
clinical treatment of seasonal affective disorder are 1)

whether <tx>light therapy</tx> is effective over longer treatment
periods, since controlled treatment studies have only
been 1–5 weeks in duration, and 2) how light therapy compares with antidepressant drugs, especially for more severely ill patients. To help answer these questions, we conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial that
compared the effectiveness of light therapy to the SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine. We randomly assigned depressed
patients with seasonal affective disorder recruited from
four Canadian cities to 8 weeks of treatment during the
winter. To balance potential expectation effects, each patient received both a light box and a pill, but only one
treatment was active in each condition.

Method
Protocol
This randomized, double-blind study was approved by a clinical research ethics board at each center. After giving written informed consent, eligible subjects entered a 1-week baseline
phase without treatment to regularize their sleep-wake schedule
(patients were instructed to sleep only between the hours of 10:00
p.m. and 8:00 a.m.) and to identify spontaneous responders. Patients who were significantly improved after the baseline week
(defined as 25% or greater improvement in depression scores)
were dropped from the study. Otherwise, they were randomly allocated to one of two treatment conditions for 8 weeks: active
light therapy plus placebo capsules, or placebo light therapy plus
active drug. Randomization codes were centrally computer generated and stratified by site in random blocks of 3–5. Allocation
concealment used opaque envelopes at each site that could only
be opened after the unique subject number was entered in a master log. Patients returned to the clinic for outcome assessments at
weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 or at unexpected termination.

Subjects
Subjects were recruited by referral and advertisements at mood
disorders clinics in 1) Vancouver, 2) Winnipeg, 3) Toronto, and 4)
Am J Psychiatry 163:5, May 2006

Saint John, New Brunswick. The inclusion criteria for the study
were male and female outpatients 18–65 years of age who had
major depressive episodes with a seasonal (winter) pattern as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)
modified to include criteria for seasonal pattern (5). In addition,
subjects were required to have a score of 20 or higher on the 17item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or a score of 14 or higher
on the 17-item version if the score on a 24-item version (subsequently described) was 23 or higher. Patients had to meet these
criteria, which indicate moderate to severe depression, both at
initial assessment and at the end of the baseline week.
Subjects were excluded from the study if they 1) were pregnant
or lactating (or were sexually active women of childbearing potential not using medically accepted means of contraception); 2)
were at serious suicidal risk in the judgment of the investigator; 3)
met DSM-IV criteria for organic mental disorders, substance use
disorders (including alcohol) within the last year, schizophrenia,
paranoid or delusional disorders, other psychotic disorders, bipolar I disorder, panic disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder not
concurrent with major depressive episodes; 4) had a serious unstable medical illness; 5) had retinal disease that precluded the
use of bright light; 6) had a history of severe allergies or multiple
drug adverse reactions; 7) were currently using other psychotropic drugs including lithium, L-tryptophan, St. John’s wort, or melatonin; 8) were currently using beta blocking drugs; 9) had used
antidepressants or mood-altering medications within 7 days of
baseline; 10) had been treated previously with fluoxetine or light
therapy; 11) had undergone formal psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive
behavior or interpersonal psychotherapy) in the 3 months preceding the study or initiated it during the study itself; or 12) performed shift work or traveled south during the protocol.
Subjects were entered into the study during the autumn and
winter months starting from Sept. 15. Enrollment was stopped by
Feb. 15 in order to reduce the possibility of spontaneous spring
remission. The study was conducted over three winter seasons
(2000/2001–2002/2003).

<tx>Light Treatment</tx>
The active light treatment consisted of daily exposure to a
white fluorescent light box (Uplift Technologies Inc. [Dartmouth,
N.S.], Model Daylight 10000, fitted with an ultraviolet filter and
rated at 10,000 lux at a distance of 14 in from screen to cornea) for

Repeated measures ANOVA examining within-subject factor of time and between-subject factors of treatment condition and site. Significant
effects were seen only for time; no main effects of treatment or site or interaction effects were found.
b The 17-item version of the Hamilton depression scale is the most widely used measure of depression severity in clinical trials. The Hamilton
total score comprises the score from the 17-item “typical symptom” version plus seven items that assess severity of atypical symptoms that
predominate in seasonal affective disorder.
30 minutes as soon as possible after awakening, between 7:00
a.m. and 8:00 a.m. A suitable <tx>placebo</tx> condition for bright light is
problematic and controversial (23). In this study, the <tx>placebo light
treatment</tx> was an identical light box fitted with a neutral density
gel filter to reduce light exposure to 100 lux. Deception was used
to enhance the plausibility of the light control condition by explaining to patients (using a structured script) that the objective
of the study was to examine different wavelengths of light and
light boxes, without mentioning the different intensities. After being shown the assigned light box, pretreatment ratings of expectations for light therapy (and separately for medication) were measured with a modified Expectation of Response questionnaire
(24) used in other seasonal affective disorder studies (25). On
study completion, the patients were debriefed and allowed to
continue receiving active light treatment if they wished.
Patients were given verbal and written instructions on the use
of the light box and a measurement tape was used to ensure
proper positioning. Illumination intensities were confirmed by
digital photometer. Adherence was measured by using daily logs
of treatment times that were completed by subjects and reviewed
at each visit. Patients were also instructed to avoid spending an
excessive or unusual amount of time outdoors during the entire
study period.

Medication Treatment
The active medication treatment was a daily, fixed dose of <tx>fluoxetine, 20 mg/day</tx>, taken between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. while the
placebo was an identical capsule containing inert filler. Adherence
was measured by pill counts at each visit. In addition, blood samples were taken at the completion of the study, and a random subset of samples were assayed for serum fluoxetine levels.

Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was the 24-item Hamilton depression scale score obtained by board-certified psychiatrists
blind to treatment assignment (the blind was maintained by having a separate research assistant managing the light device treatment and asking patients not to discuss side effects or specifics of
treatment with the rater). A semistructured interview, the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale,
Seasonal Affective Disorders Version (SIGH-SAD) (22) was used to
increase reliability. The SIGH-SAD generates scores for several
versions of the Hamilton depression scale, including the 17-item
version, the 21-item version, and an eight-item atypical symptom

808

ajp.psychiatryonline.org

addendum. This atypical addendum was included because the
original Hamilton scale does not rate symptoms such as hypersomnia, increased appetite, and weight gain, which predominate
in seasonal affective disorder. Some seasonal affective disorder
studies report the total 29-item SIGH-SAD score, which consists
of the 21-item Hamilton scale plus the eight-item atypical symptom addendum. However, the 17-item Hamilton scale is the most
widely used measure of depression severity in clinical trials because the 21-item measure includes four items (diurnal variation
of mood, paranoid thoughts, obsessive-compulsive symptoms,
depersonalization) originally added to subtype the depressive episode, not to measure severity. Similarly, the eight-item atypical
symptom addendum includes one comparable subtyping item
reflecting diurnal mood variation (afternoon slump). Therefore,
like other seasonal affective disorder studies (10), we used the
Hamilton measure that best reflects severity of depression in seasonal affective disorder, namely the 24-item Hamilton depression
scale (comprising 17 “typical symptom” items plus seven “atypical symptom” items). Interrater reliability of the SIGH-SAD was
assessed using videotaped interviews with an intraclass correlation of 0.95 for the 24-item Hamilton scale.
Clinical response was defined as 50% or greater reduction from
baseline in 24-item Hamilton depression scale scores at the last
visit, while clinical remission was defined as clinical response
plus a score of 8 or less. Other outcome measures included Clinical Global Impression rating and score on the patient-rated Beck
Depression Inventory II, which includes items for atypical symptoms. Adverse effects were monitored using the Adverse Events
Scale (unpublished scale from the Canadian Network for Mood
and Anxiety Treatments available on request). This self-rated
scale assesses both frequency and severity (rated as none, mild,
moderate or severe) of 32 adverse events (including a category for
“other”) and provides a more comprehensive and systematic
evaluation of adverse events than is usually conducted in antidepressant clinical trials. A treatment-emergent adverse event was
defined as any increase in rating during treatment to a score of
moderate or severe.

Statistical Analysis
All patients randomly assigned to a treatment condition were
included in the intent-to-treat analysis, with missing data handled using the last observation carried forward method. Sample
size was estimated on the basis of a power analysis using endpoint change scores on the main outcome variable. Assuming a

standard deviation of 6 points, a study with 45 patients per condition would allow 80% power to detect a mean difference of at least
3.6 points or an effect size of 0.6, regarded as a medium-sized
treatment effect in behavioral studies.
All treatment variables remained coded, and the analysts and
investigators were blind to variable identity during the primary
analysis and interpretation. The continuous outcome scores were
analyzed by using repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA), with one within-subject factor (time) and two betweensubject factors (treatment condition and site). A Greenhouse-Geisser correction was conducted to adjust for degrees of freedom if
the Mauchly Test of Sphericity was significant. In this analysis,
differences between treatment conditions would show as significant condition-by-time or condition-by-time-by-site interaction
effects. This analysis also assumes compound symmetry, which,
if violated, may lead to type I errors greater than the nominal values. Post hoc t tests were done to examine differences between
conditions on change scores at each visit. Dichotomous variables
were tested by using chi square tests with Fisher’s exact tests as
appropriate. All analyses were done by using SPSS v.11.

Results
Figure 1 shows the patient numbers through the phases
of the study. A total of 96 patients were randomly assigned
to a treatment condition. Table 1 shows clinical information on the patients in the two groups. There were no significant differences noted for any of the clinical variables.
The analysis of expectation ratings showed a main effect
for modality, in that higher expectations were recorded for
the light treatment compared with <tx>fluoxetine</tx> (F=9.8, df=1,
75, p=0.003), but there were no main or interaction effects
with treatment condition, so that there were no differences in expectations for light or drug between patients
assigned to either treatment.

no main effects were seen for treatment condition or site.
There were no significant interaction effects for conditionby-time or condition-by-time-by-site. The same findings
held for the patient-rated measure, the Beck Depression
Inventory II. These analyses show that both groups improved on all measures over time but that there were no
differences in the responses to the two conditions or between the four sites. Another analysis showed no differences in outcome measures with month of entry into the
study (data not shown).
There were no significant differences between light
treatment and fluoxetine in the clinical response rate (67%
for both conditions) (χ2=0, df=1, p=1.00) or the clinical remission rate (50% versus 54%, respectively) (χ2=0.04, df=1,
p=0.84). Similarly, there were no significant differences between conditions in the CGI improvement rating at last
visit (mean=1.90 [SD=1.15] versus 1.92 [SD=1.09], respectively) (t=0.09, df=94, p=0.93). Another measure of clinical
response is the percentage of patients with “much improved” or “very much improved” CGI ratings; again, there
were no differences between conditions on this measure
(73% for both groups) (χ2=0, df=1, p=1.00).
Figure 2 shows the changes in 24-item Hamilton depression scale scores from baseline for each week of treatment.
Post hoc t tests showed that patients in the bright light
condition improved more in the first week of treatment
relative to those in the fluoxetine condition. However, the

study for the 24-item Hamilton change score between
treatments at the final visit was 0.03 in favor of light treatment, indicating a trivial difference between conditions.
A subset of patients (N=49) was identified as being more
severely depressed at baseline (24-item Hamilton depression scale scores ≥30). In this more severely ill subgroup,
there were no significant differences in the 24-item Hamilton depression scale scores between the light-treated patients (N=27) and the fluoxetine-treated patients (N=22).
The results again showed a significant main effect for time
(F=49.2, df=2.9, 39, p<0.0005), but no other significant
main effects or interaction effects were found. Similarly, in
these more severely ill patients, there were no significant
differences between light treatment and fluoxetine in the
clinical response rates (70% versus 73%, respectively) (χ2=
0, df=1, p=1.00) or the remission rates (48% versus 50%, respectively) (χ2=0, df=1, p=1.00).
The percentage of patients experiencing at least one
treatment-emergent adverse event was 77% for light treatment and 75% for fluoxetine. Table 3 shows the treatmentemergent adverse events reported in more than 5% of pa-

tients for either condition. Significant differences in treatment-emergent adverse events, all higher in the fluoxetinetreated patients, were found for agitation, sleep disturbance, and palpitations. There were no switches to hypomania with either treatment. The percentage of patients reporting at least one treatment-emergent adverse events
self-rated as “severe” at least once during treatment was
33.3% for bright light and 35.4% for fluoxetine (χ2=0, df=1,
p=1.00). Similarly, there were no significant differences between light and fluoxetine treatment in overall dropout
rates in the study (8 versus 7, respectively; χ2=0, df=1, p=
1.00) or in dropouts due to treatment-emergent adverse
events (N=1 and 2, respectively; χ2=0, df=1, p=1.00).

Discussion
The main results of this study showed that there were no
differences in the primary or secondary outcomes for patients with seasonal affective disorder who received active
light therapy versus those who received fluoxetine. The
clinical response and remission rates for light therapy and
fluoxetine were very similar throughout the study. The benefits of treatment were apparent in both interviewer-rated
and patient-rated outcome scales and in the typical and
atypical symptom subscales. The light-treated patients had
a greater improvement after 1 week of treatment (a finding
which, given the post hoc nature of the analysis, needs to be
regarded with caution), but thereafter there were no differences between conditions. Another caveat is that the study
was only powered to detect medium-sized or larger effects.
However, the actual differences between treatments in this
study were so small that a huge sample (numbering in the
thousands of patients) would be required to detect these effect sizes. Even if statistically significant, these small effect
sizes would not be clinically meaningful.
This trial is the longest controlled study of light therapy.
At 8 weeks, it is the only one of similar duration to the standard antidepressant clinical trial. Given the natural course
of seasonal affective disorder with spontaneous clinical
remission in the spring/summer, it is important for a
longer-duration study to start treatment well before the
time of spontaneous remission (18). In this study, there
were no differences in outcome with month of entry, indicating that spontaneous remissions were avoided with patients entered in the later months. We also used a higher
entry score on the 24-item Hamilton depression scale
than other seasonal affective disorder studies, ensuring
that patients were at least moderately depressed before
treatment assignment.
Comparing light therapy and antidepressant medication is difficult because of differences in procedure and expectations with the two treatments. Light therapy has a
behavioral component in that patients must wake up and
spend 30 minutes in quiet activity while receiving light.
The finding that expectation ratings were higher for light
therapy than for medication confirms that it was also imAm J Psychiatry 163:5, May 2006

portant to control for positive expectation effects of light
treatment. We chose to use the “double dummy treatment” method to control for these nonspecific effects by
having patients use both a light device and a pill. “Dim”
light of 100 lux is still plausible to patients but is no
brighter than ordinary kitchen lighting that patients might
experience in their own homes. The deception was effective because there were no differences in pretreatment expectations for light between the groups even after patients
were shown their assigned light box. Regardless, because
100-lux light may have some biological activity under certain conditions (26), we cannot exclude the possibility that
the dim light may have some active antidepressant effect.
Another limitation of this study is that a “double placebo” was not used, so we cannot rule out placebo effects
(or the effects of waking up early) in the overall responses
to both treatments. Given that both light therapy and fluoxetine have evidence for efficacy versus placebo, we believed that an effectiveness study (comparing two active
treatments) would be adequate to answer the clinical
questions. Reassuringly, the response and remission rates
for light and fluoxetine in this study were similar in magnitude to those reported in placebo-controlled trials.
Of interest is that the response to light therapy in this
study was not as rapid as reported in other shorter-term
light studies. Patients showed steady improvement during
the course of the 8 weeks, a pattern more similar to a medication effect. A possible explanation is that different expectation effects for a shorter-term study may contribute
to the rapid response (27).
This study was a comparison of fixed-dose strategies. It
is possible that the response rates would be higher if
higher dosing was used. However, fluoxetine has a flat
dose-response curve so that studies comparing higher fluoxetine doses do not show greater response (28–30). As for
light therapy, there have been few studies of optimal “dosing” of light (31). The morning timing of light therapy followed standard practice based on results from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. However, one
meta-analysis found that morning plus evening light exposure was more effective than exposure at a single time
of day (32). Another study suggested that light therapy is
most effective if applied at an optimal time in the circadian phase of the patient (33), which may be at different
external clock times for individual patients. Although this
latter finding has yet to be replicated, if true, then the
morning timing of light in this study may not have been
optimal for every patient.
Some previous studies have suggested that fluoxetine is
more effective than placebo in more severely ill patients
(18), while light therapy is more effective in less severely ill
patients (8). In our study, just over half of the patients were
considered to be more severely depressed, i.e., with a baseline score ≥30 on the 24-item Hamilton depression scale. In
Am J Psychiatry 163:5, May 2006

the post hoc analysis for this subset of patients, there was a
good response to both treatments, but no differences were
seen between treatments in improvement in depression
scores or in clinical response or remission rates. Therefore,
both light therapy and fluoxetine are comparably effective,
even in more severely ill outpatients.
Fluoxetine was associated with a greater frequency of
some treatment-emergent adverse events (agitation, sleep
disturbance, palpitations) than light therapy, but both
treatments were generally well tolerated, and there were
no differences in severe treatment-emergent adverse
events or dropouts due to adverse events. The higher rate
of treatment-emergent adverse events reported in this
study is likely related to the use of a self-rated adverse
events scale instead of relying on unsystematic and spontaneous reports of adverse events as per usual in clinical
trials. Despite this more intensive approach, the rates of
many treatment-emergent adverse events, such as sexual
dysfunction, were low (less than 5%) for both light therapy
and fluoxetine. Adherence to treatment was also good in
this study, as evidenced by patient logs and pill counts.
However, studies have suggested that objective measures
of adherence with light therapy usually show lower adherence rates than subjective patient reports (34).
In summary, light therapy and fluoxetine are comparably effective treatments for patients with seasonal affective disorder, although light treatment may have a slightly
faster onset of effect and slightly fewer treatment-emergent adverse events. The choice of treatment always depends on individual assessment of risks and benefits (15),
but in the absence of clear superiority for either treatment,
patient preference should be a major factor in treatment
selection. Predictive factors (symptoms, personality traits,
circadian measures) of response to light or medication,
and differences in quality of life and cost-benefit of treatments, also should be of interest; analyses of other data
from this study addressing these issues are in progress. Future seasonal affective disorder studies should also examine the combination of light therapy and antidepressants
for nonresponders to monotherapy.
