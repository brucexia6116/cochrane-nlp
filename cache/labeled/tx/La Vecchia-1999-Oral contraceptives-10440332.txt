Authors’ reply
Sir—In our trial, the total number of
days in hospital was 18% lower in
patients from the co-trimoxazole
group than in those from the <tx>placebo</tx>
group (758 vs 924). This reduction
was more important for the total
number of days at the day-hospital
(–34%, 205 vs 309) than for the
number of inpatient days at the
university hospital (–10%, 553 v s
615).
The
total
number
of
unscheduled consultations was 12%
lower in the <tx>co-trimoxazole</tx> group than
in the <tx>placebo</tx> group (3744 vs 4265).
There were 348 days in hospital and
1717 unscheduled consultations per
100 person-years in the <tx>co-trimoxazole</tx>
group, versus 430 and 1984 in the
<tx>placebo</tx> group. Thus, in our
population and under our standard of
care, <tx>co-trimoxazole prophylaxis</tx> could
be roughly estimated to have saved 82
days in hospital and 267 consultations
per 100 person-years, in addition
with
all
related
unscheduled
complementary examinations and
curative treatments. The overall cost
of these two latter factors was about
eight times higher than that of hospital
admissions.
Accurate cost-effectiveness analyses
should take into account other factors
(eg, numbers of unemployed days).
Our trial did not have the best designs
to allow such analyses, because our
conditions of care (consultations,
medications,
examinations
and
hospitalisations free of charge, and
examinations not routinely used in
other community clinics) differed from
the usual conditions of Côte d’Ivoire
where patients have to pay for all
services. We thus fully agree with
Christopher Hudson and Timothy
Roach that cost-effectiveness analysis
still needs to be done in resourcepoor settings where <tx>co-trimoxazole</tx>
prophylaxis could be recommended.
These analyses, which need to

THE LANCET • Vol 354 • July 24, 1999

document the number of hospital
admissions
and
consultations
according to diagnostic category,
could also help establish whether to
recommend the large-scale use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis at early stages
of HIV-1-infection, at more advanced
ones, or not to recommend it,
depending on the local spectrum of
HIV-1-related infections.
In Côte d’Ivoire, a recent national
consensus statement recommended
that co-trimoxazole prophylaxis should
be systemically proposed to all HIV-1infected adults at WHO clinical
stages 2, 3, or 4, and that these
recommendations should be adapted
in the future, depending on the
evolution of bacterial susceptibility to
c o - t r i m o x a z o l e . 1 If resistance of
pneumococci
and
non-typhi
salmonella becomes as frequent in
Côte d’Ivoire as in Malawi, future
statements will be likely to favour an
advanced co-trimoxazole chemoprophylaxis, to focus on parasitic
infections that are common in patients
with low CD4 cell counts. The results
of our early prophylaxis trial should
not mask the efficacy of cotrimoxazole in the prevention of
toxoplasmosis at more advanced
stages. Although Richard Brindle
argues that “the choice of cotrimoxazole seems to have been based
more on its historical use . . . than on
the microbiology of HIV-1-associated
infections
in
Africa”,
the
“historically”-proven efficacy of cotrimoxazole against toxoplasmosis,
together with the spectrum of severe
morbidity related to HIV-1-infection
in Côte d’Ivoire, were part of our
decision to chose co-trimoxazole.
Trimethoprim alone cannot be
considered
as
the
first-line
toxoplasmosis primary prophylaxis.
We share the concerns of Richard
Brindle, and Martin Boeree and their
colleagues about the spread of
bacterial and parasitic resistance.
However, <tx>co-trimoxazole</tx> has been
widely used in Africa for a long
time, and both bacterial resistance to
<tx>co-trimoxazole</tx> and P falciparum
resistance
to
<tx>sulphadoxinepyrimethamine</tx> exist in African
settings
where
<tx>co-trimoxazole</tx>
prophylaxis is not introduced. Thus,
it is likely that <tx>co-trimoxazole</tx> will
continue to be widely prescribed,
and that susceptibility will continue
to drop, even if <tx>co-trimoxazole</tx>
prophylaxis is not recommended
widely. Before this resistance becomes
widespread, should <tx>co-trimoxazole</tx>
be reserved for a non-HIV-related
use in Africa? We believe that this
question should be carefully discussed,

together with the risk of “therapeutic
nihilism” mentioned by Motasim
Badri and colleagues.

Oral contraceptives and
risk of hip fractures
Sir—Karl Michaëlsson and colleagues’
data (May 1, p 1481)1 from a large
case-control study from Sweden
indicate an inverse relation between
use of <tx>oral contraceptives</tx> and the risk
of hip fractures, which, if confirmed,
would have major public-health
implications.
We examined this issue with data
from a case-control study of hip
fractures undertaken in Italy between
1983 and 1992.2,3 Cases were 279
women aged 29–74 years (median age
62), admitted to a network of teaching
and general hospitals in the greater
Milan area. Controls were 1861
women, aged 25–74 (median age 55)
admitted for non-traumatic conditions
to the same network of hospitals.
Ever use of oral contraceptives was
reported by ten (4%) cases and 167
(9%) controls, corresponding to a
multivariate odds ratio of 0·98 (95%
CI, 0·47–2·03). The odds ratio was
1·04 (0·42–2·55) for women who had
used <tx>oral contraceptives</tx> for 2 years or
longer. Among ever users of hormone
replacement therapy the odds ratio
was 0·53 (0·23–1·19).
Our study does not lend support to
the existence of a consistent relation of
hip-fracture risk with use of oral
contraceptives. Given the low
frequency of users, our study had
limited power to detect a potential
association
between
exogenous
oestrogens
and
hip
fractures.
Nevertheless our risk estimates accord
with a reduced risk in users of
hormone replacement therapy.4,5 This
finding is consistent with a short-term
influence of <tx>oestrogen</tx> on bone mass. 4,5

Mannose-binding lectin and
meningococcal disease
Sir—Martin Hibberd and colleagues
(March 27, p 1049)1 report that genetic
variants of mannose-binding lectin
(MBL) are associated with increased
susceptibility to meningococcal disease
in two separate studies, one with
controls admitted to hospital with noninfectious disorders and the other with
healthy controls recruited in the
community.
Further analysis of the data reveals
two additional interesting results. The
first is the hospital and community
control groups differ in allele frequency
for the codon 52 MBL variant (0·024 vs
0·045) and codon 54 variant (0·066 vs
0·141). Combining the two variants
gives an odds ratio of 0·43 (p=0·0002).
The second result is that the codon 57
variant, measured only in the hospital
study, seems to have a protective rather
than a harmful effect (allelic odds ratio
0·36, p=0·04). If these differences do
not reflect ethnic biases in the control
group (racial differences in MBL
variants are well described), 2,3 they
suggest that: codon 52 and 54 variants
may protect against the non-infectious
disorders in the hospital controls; and
that the codon 57 variant, which is
most common among Africans,2,3 has
an opposite effect on meningococcal
disease outcome to codon 52 and 54
variants. Are Hibberd and colleagues
able to shed any light on these
observations?

Sir—Martin Hibberd and colleagues1
report an increased frequency of MBL
variant alleles causing dominant
decrease in the MBL serum
concentration in English patients with
meningococcal disease. In 1993, we
reported a lack of association with low
serum concentrations of MBL and
tendency to meningococcal serogroup
B (n=74) or serogroup C (n=25)
disease in Norwegian patients (52
females) aged 12–21 years compared
with controls.2 These patients also took
part in a national, randomised trial of
vaccine efficacy against serogroup B
meningococcal
disease,
which
comprised 171 800 students in
Norwegian secondary school3 and
54 000 military recruits. 119 individuals
of the study population developed
meningococcal disease during the 3year observation period. Serum samples
from 13 fatal cases were not available
for the investigation. Among the 106
survivors, serum samples were taken
from the 99 included patients, which
were collected at least 6 months after
the onset of disease.
Because of the complexity of the
MBL polymorphisms, 4 our serum
measurement may not adequately
reflect the MBL polymorphisms in the
patients, which could explain the
discrepancy between our results and
those of Hibberd and colleagues.
Therefore, our patients were asked to
donate an additional blood sample for
DNA analysis; 75 of the previously
included patients agreed to take part in
the genetic study. The overall
frequency of MBL variant alleles in the
patients with meningococcal disease
was almost identical to that found in
Norwegian controls (0·19 and 0·21,
respectively,* which lends support to
the conclusion in our earlier study.2
There were an excess of MBL-variantalleles homozygotes, in the English
patients, but no excess in the
Norwegian patients (1·3% vs 3% in the
controls). In addition, no association
was found with an MBL promoter allele
in position Ϫ221 (X/Y), which is also
associated with low MBL serum
concentrations. Stratification in receipt
of active vaccine versus placebo did not
change the overall conclusion.
The discrepancies between the
English and the Norwegian studies are
not clear. It may be argued that we
studied only survivors and, thus, missed

fatal cases who might have been
deficient in MBL. However, in the
English study, the patients homozygous
for MBL variant alleles had a lower
mortality rate and less use of intensive
care than their MBL competent
counterparts, which argues against such
a bias in our patients.
The English study comprised one
hospital-based study (n=194, mean age
3·5 years) and one community-based
study (n=72, mean age 15 years). In
the Norwegian study the median age
was 16 years. However, with
stratification according to genotype,
carriers of MBL variant alleles tended
to be younger when they contracted
meningococcal disease than those
homozygous for the normal allele
(median age 15 years and 17 years,
respectively; Mann-Whitney, p=0·05).
The MBL variant allele frequency in
those below 16 years was 0·25,
compared with 0·15 in those 16 years
or older (Fisher’s p=0·06). This result
indicates that MBL may have an
immune protective role against
meningococcal disease in young
patients, whereas it is less important in
the older patients. This could partly
explain the differences between the
English and Norwegian findings.
Thus, the MBL variant alleles did
not contribute to the overall protection
against meningococcal disease in
Norwegian patients, but an agedependent effect seems possible and
needs to be further investigated, for
example, in the community-based part
of the study by Hibberd and colleagues.
