Letter to the editor

An observational study of red cell
transfusion in specialist palliative care
Dear Sir – We wish to report our findings of an observational study of red cell transfusion practice in specialist
palliative care.
This was conducted in two specialist palliative care
inpatient units in the United Kingdom. The combined
catchment population was one million and, in the period
analysed, there were 944 admissions.
One hundred transfusion episodes occurred and
<n>73</n> individual patients received transfusions. Fifty-four
(73.9%) patients received a single transfusion with the
remaining 19 (26.1%) receiving multiple transfusions.
Thirty-five (47.9%) patients were male and the mean age
was 66.5 years (range 37–102 years, SD 13.56). Seventytwo (98.6%) patients had a malignant diagnosis. Prostate
cancer was the most common primary tumour and
occurred in 19 (26.3%) patients. There was a high proportion of patients with gastrointestinal cancer and lung cancer; 13 (17.8%) and 11 (15.1%) respectively. The most
common site of metastases was bone, present in 32
(44%) patients.
Low haemoglobin (Hb) level was documented as a trigger, either solely or in conjunction with other reasons, in
73 (73%) transfusions. Anaemia was deemed the only reason for transfusion in 26 (26%) cases. Haematinics (B12,
folate, ferritin or combination) were checked in nine (9%)
transfusions. The mean pre-transfusion Hb was 7.9 g/dL
(range 4.3–11.4, SD 0.95) and mean post-transfusion Hb
was 10.0 g/dL (range 7.2–13.0, SD 1.29). The mean number of units transfused was 2.2 (range 2–4 units).
A response to transfusion was recorded in 38 (38%)
transfusion episodes with 31 (31%) having a positive
response. The transfusion decision was not documented
as being discussed with either patients and/or relatives in
the majority of cases (78%). The mean number of days
between the last transfusion and death was 47 days
(range 2–293 days, SD 57.1). Ten (13.7%) patients died
within seven days of transfusion.

Discussion
Most studies examining cancer-related anaemia include a
large spectrum of disease and disease stages, but there is a
paucity of data regarding transfusion in a hospice setting.

This study focuses on a population who are in the
advanced stages of cancer, with most patients in the last
two months of life.
The British Society of Haematology (BSH) guidelines
for the clinical use of red cell transfusions recommend that
the cause of the anaemia be established, with red cell
transfusions reserved for situations where no other effective alternative exists.1 Of the 73 patients included in our
study, only six patients had had their haematinics
checked. Cancer-related anaemia is often multi-factorial
in origin (e.g., secondary to surgery, marrow infiltration,
chemotherapy or radiotherapy, haemorrhage, malnutrition); however, deficiencies in folate and/or B12 can exist
and should be investigated. Our findings suggest that
investigation into the possible causes of anaemia does
not occur as frequently as it should.
The BSH guidelines acknowledge that there is no ‘haemoglobin trigger’ for red cell transfusion, instead describing the multiple factors and symptoms that should be
considered when assessing the need for a red cell transfusion. The principal factor on which a decision to transfuse
was made was based on Hb in 26% of cases. Traditionally,
the Hb trigger for transfusion has been influenced by postoperative data.2 Although post-operative patients often
have a defined cause of anaemia and the ability to recover,
anaemia in cancer patients is multi-factorial and is not
going to spontaneous recover.
A Hb of <12 g/dL can affect adversely cognitive function, quality of life and induce fatigue.3 It has also been
shown that a Hb >12 g/dL improves fatigue and quality
of life, and even in mild anaemia (10 < Hb < 12 g/dL),
there is a marked increase in fatigue.4,5 These studies were
performed in patients receiving active cancer treatment and
whether or not these findings can be extrapolated to patients
in the latter stages of cancer is uncertain. In the advanced
cancer population, however, fatigue and quality of life are
extremely important. Therefore, a Hb of 12 g/dL or above
may be the target that should be achieved when transfusing.
In the majority of cases, transfusion was not documented as being discussed with either the patients and/or relatives. There is no legal requirement for written consent to
transfusion in the United Kingdom and the nature of
implied consent would entail that all patients agreed to
the transfusions. Nevertheless, the BSH state that patients
should be given information about both the risks and benefits of red cell transfusions in advance whenever possible.
The importance of documented patient discussion cannot
be over emphasized.

Letter to the editor 875
Anaemia, in the setting of advanced cancer, is a complex problem that affects individuals in different ways.
Investigation into the underlying cause is imperative and
will help direct treatment appropriately. Haemoglobin
level is an important factor, possibly with an optimum
lower level of 12 gd/L or above. The decision to transfuse
should be based upon symptoms, have clear goals and the
response should be ascertained.
