BACKGROUND: This study was designed to assess whether the use of ganirelix in women undergoing stimulated
IUI could prevent the occurrence of premature LH rises and luteinization (LH + progesterone rises). METHODS:
Women of infertile couples, diagnosed with unexplained or male factor infertility, were randomized to receive either
ganirelix (n = 103) or placebo (n = 100) in a double-blind design. All women were treated with an individualized, lowdose rFSH regimen started on day 2–3 of cycle. Ganirelix (0.25 mg/day) was started if one or more follicles Ն14 mm
were visualized. Ovulation was triggered by HCG injection when at least one follicle Ն18 mm was observed and a single IUI was performed 34–42 h later. The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of premature LH rises (± progesterone rise). RESULTS: In the ganirelix group, four subjects had a premature LH rise (value Ն10 IU/l), one LH
rise prior to the start of ganirelix and three LH rises during ganirelix treatment, whereas in the placebo group 28
subjects had a premature LH rise, six subjects prior to the start of placebo and 22 subjects during placebo treatment.
The incidence of LH rises was significantly lower in ganirelix cycles compared to placebo cycles (3.9 versus 28.0%;
P = 0.003 for ITT analysis). When excluding subjects with an LH value Ն10 IU/l before the start of ganirelix/placebo
the incidence of LH rises was also significantly lower in ganirelix cycles compared to placebo cycles (2.9 versus
23.4%; P = 0.003 for ITT analysis). Premature luteinization (LH rise with concomitant progesterone rise Ն1 ng/ml)
was observed in one subject in the ganirelix group and in 17 subjects in the placebo group of which three subjects had
a premature spontaneous ovulation. Ongoing pregnancy rates per attempt were 12.6 and 12.0% for the ganirelix and
placebo groups respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ganirelix effectively prevents premature LH rises,
luteinization in subjects undergoing stimulated IUI. Low-dose rFSH regimen combined with a GnRH antagonist may
be an alternative treatment option for subjects with previous proven luteinization or in subjects who would otherwise
require insemination when staff are not working.

Introduction
At present, controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) treatment
combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI) is widely used
in unexplained or male factor infertility. The use of IUI with
COS (as compared to COS alone) may result in improved cycle
fecundity (Dodson and Haney, 1991; Cohlen et al., 2000). In

several studies comparing the results of IUI with or without
COS, it became evident that the use of COS with IUI may result
in higher success rates (Hannoun et al., 1998; Guzick et al.,
1999), but this improvement should be weighed against the
increased risk for complications. The combination of IUI with
gonadotrophin treatment also resulted in higher pregnancy

Ganirelix effectively prevents premature LH surges in stimulated IUI

Materials and methods
Subjects
A total of 204 women, scheduled for stimulated IUI, were randomly
assigned (described below) to receive ganirelix (n = 104) or placebo
(n = 100). They were recruited from 10 centres in four European
countries and in Canada. The number of selected subjects per centre
ranged from three to 44. Selection criteria were: healthy females of
infertile couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility or mild malefactor infertility, aged 18–39 years at screening, a body mass index
(BMI) of 18–29 kg/m2, a body weight of 50–90 kg, a regular menstrual cycle with a range of 24–35 days, bilateral tubal patency confirmed by a laparoscopy or hysterosalpingogram, a total motile sperm
count ≥10×106 /ml, no (history of) endocrine abnormality, no serum
FSH and/or LH >10 IU/l during the early follicular phase (cycle days
2–7), no abnormal cervical smear, not more than three previous IUI
attempts, no use of hormonal preparations within 1 month prior to
treatment and willing to give written informed consent.
Study design
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, multicentre trial designed to assess whether the use of ganirelix
would reduce the incidence of LH rises during ovarian stimulation
treatment. Subjects who complied with all selection criteria were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups by giving them a code
number from a randomization list in the order of enrolment. Recombinant (r) FSH treatment (follitropin beta, Puregon®/Follistim®; NV
Organon, The Netherlands) was started from day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle (equals day 1 of the treatment cycle) onwards by a oncedaily s.c. injection in the abdominal wall, injected by the patient using
Puregon Pen (Follistim AQ Cartridge). The rFSH starting dose was
determined by the investigator based on patient’s characteristics and
history. On day 6, the dose of rFSH could be adjusted, depending on
the individual ovarian response as assessed by ultrasound. The dose
increments of rFSH were not predefined. Ganirelix (0.25 mg per day,
Orgalutran®; NV Organon, The Netherlands) or placebo treatment
was given by a daily s.c. injection as soon as one or more follicles ≥14 mm
were seen on transvaginal ultrasound. Unlike the rFSH, the ganirelix
or placebo was administered by the investigator or a nurse. Both the
rFSH and the ganirelix/placebo treatments were continued until (and
including) the day of ovulation induction. On the day when at least
one follicle ≥18 mm was observed by ultrasound, ovulation was triggered by means of a single i.m. injection of 5000 or 10 000 IU HCG
(Pregnyl®; NV Organon, The Netherlands). A single IUI was performed 34–42 h after HCG administration, and luteal phase support
was started in all patients according to the preference of the treatment
centre. The cycle was cancelled if more than three follicles ≥14 mm were
observed on ultrasound. In such cases, the cycle could be converted
into an IVF cycle. All subjects gave written informed consent. The
study was approved by the Ethics Committee of each participating
centre and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, the
ICH guidelines, and Good Clinical Practice.
Assessments
Prior to the treatment cycle, a pregnancy test was performed, ultrasonography of the ovaries was assessed and a blood sample was taken
for hormone assessments (by the local laboratory). From day 1 of
rFSH treatment, the subjects returned to the clinic at least every 2 days
for ultrasonography. When one or more follicles ≥14 mm were seen
by ultrasound until and including the day of ovulation induction,
blood samples were taken daily for hormone assessments. All blood
samples were drawn prior to daily drug administration. Serum LH,
FSH, estradiol (E2) and progesterone values were determined by a

rates when compared to IUI cycles with clomiphene citrate
stimulation (Hannoun et al., 1998; Matorras et al., 2002). In
comparison with the more expensive and invasive IVF, COS
with IUI appears to have a similar cumulative pregnancy rate
(Goverde et al., 2000; Hughes, 2003; Pandian et al., 2003).
Therefore, the balance between benefits and costs often
favours COS. However, the use of COS for IUI is associated
with an increased risk of multiple pregnancies and ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Therefore, new low-dose
treatments with recombinant FSH (rFSH) combined with IUI
have been studied for treatment of unexplained or male factor
infertility (Hughes et al., 1998; Sengoku et al., 1999; Ragni
et al., 2004). The results of these studies indicate that a daily
low dose of FSH (50 or 75 IU) could reduce the incidence of
OHSS and multiple pregnancy rates while retaining comparable pregnancy rates (Sengoku et al., 1999; Ragni et al., 2004).
The main drawback of COS regimens is the frequent occurrence of premature LH rises and luteinization (Loumaye,
1990). This may interfere with the adequate timing of IUI or
result in cycle cancellation, thus impairing the pregnancy
rate. In IVF it is well known that the combination of GnRH
agonist (Barlow, 1998) or antagonist (Shapiro and MitchellLeef, 2003) with COS treatment improves the reproductive
outcome by preventing premature LH surges and synchronizing the development of follicles. Some previous studies on
COS/IUI treatment in unexplained infertility have demonstrated that the addition of a GnRH agonist suppresses
the occurrence of premature luteinization (Dodson et al.,
1991; Sengoku et al., 1994). However, these studies did not
find an enhanced cycle fecundity with the addition of a
GnRH agonist.
Ganirelix (Orgalutran®) is a GnRH antagonist developed for
the prevention of an endogenous LH surge in women undergoing COS for assisted reproduction techniques. Studies have
demonstrated the benefits of ganirelix treatment in IVF regimens (Out and Mannaerts, 2002).
Recently one small open-labelled, randomized study
(Gomez-Palomares et al., 2005) showed more mature follicles
and clinical pregnancies in IUI patients treated with rFSH and
ganirelix than in patients treated with rFSH alone (clinical pregnancy rate 38 versus 14%); however, this improved clinical outcome was thought to be related to the longer stimulation
resulting in more mature ovulatory follicles, which also
increases the risk of multiple gestations.
In another small controlled IUI study, no significant differences for these parameters (Williams et al., 2004) were found
and clinical pregnancy rates were 12% in the ganirelix group
versus 7% in the control group. However, neither of these
two studies basically investigated the potential of combining
these treatments to inhibit premature LH and progesterone
rises.
To date, no placebo-controlled data are available on the
use of a GnRH antagonist in COS combined with IUI.
Therefore, the present study was designed to assess whether
the use of ganirelix (as compared to a placebo) in women
undergoing treatment with recombinant FSH (rFSH) for IUI
could reduce the incidence of premature LH rises and luteinization.

central laboratory (ABL BV, Assen, The Netherlands). A pregnancy
(HCG) test was performed in the second week after the day of IUI. If
the HCG test result was positive, ultrasonography was performed at
5–6 weeks after IUI to confirm intrauterine pregnancy. To establish
ongoing pregnancy, ultrasonography was done 12–16 weeks after IUI.

injection or did receive an HCG injection after switching to IVF. For
all of these main outcome measures, summary statistics were calculated for the intent-to-treat (ITT) group defined as all randomized subjects who received one dose of rFSH.

Statistical analysis
This study was designed to test whether ganirelix is superior to placebo in preventing premature LH rises in women undergoing mild
COS for IUI. For this purpose, a double-blind, placebo-controlled
design was chosen. Given a premature LH rise in 3% of the ganirelix
group (European Ganirelix Study Group, 2000) versus 15% of the placebo group (Sengoku et al., 1994), 89 evaluable subjects per treatment
group gave a power of 80% to detect a difference at P < 0.05. To
allow for a 10% rate of premature discontinuation, ∼100 subjects per
treatment group were considered to be sufficient.
The primary efficacy outcome measure was the incidence of premature LH rises (with or without a progesterone rise). A premature LH
rise was defined as a serum LH value ≥10 IU/l during the period of
ganirelix or placebo treatment, but not within 4 h after the first administration of the investigational product. Premature luteinization was
defined as a premature LH rise, as defined above, with a serum progesterone value ≥1 ng/ml (≥3.18 nmol/l). To establish a significant
treatment difference in incidence of premature LH rises, the exact
method of Berger and Boos (1994) was used, with P < 0.05. All tests
were two-sided. The other main efficacy outcome measures were
serum LH values, treatment failure rate, and ongoing pregnancy rate.
A treatment failure was recorded if the subject did not have HCG

Figure 1 presents the subject disposition, including the number
of subjects who discontinued in each stage of the study and the
reasons for discontinuation. Of 204 patients randomized, one
subject did not start treatment because of a spontaneous pregnancy. As a result, in total 203 women started rFSH treatment
(ITT group). Of these, 193 subjects received treatment with
either ganirelix (n = 98) or placebo (n = 95). The main reasons
for discontinuation before HCG injection were too many
follicles (n = 8) and an insufficient ovarian response (n = 5).
Among the HCG-treated patients (n = 187), nine women (three
in the ganirelix group and six in the placebo group) had more
than three follicles ≥14 mm and were converted to IVF. In
total, 93 subjects in the ganirelix group and 85 in the placebo
group underwent an IUI. None of the patients discontinued
because of an adverse event or serious adverse event.

women who started treatment. No clinically relevant differences were observed between the two groups.

>14 mm and lasted for 3 days in each group. In most subjects,
the starting dose of rFSH was 50, 75 or 100 IU. The percentages of subjects starting with these doses were similar for both
treatment groups, i.e. about 27, 45 and 16% respectively. The
total median dose of rFSH was 550 IU in the ganirelix group
and 600 IU in the placebo group.

As can be seen from data in Figure 1, 96 out of 103 subjects of
the ganirelix group and 91 out of 100 subjects of the placebo
group received an HCG injection. As three (ganirelix group)
and six (placebo group) of these HCG-treated subjects
switched to IVF, 10 subjects (9.7%) of the ganirelix group and
15 subjects (15.0%) of the placebo group can be considered to
have had a treatment failure. The main reason for treatment
failure was the development of too many follicles, occurring in
seven and 10 subjects of the ganirelix and placebo groups
respectively.

Table III presents the frequency of subjects with LH values
≥10 IU/l prior to and after start of ganirelix/placebo treatment.
Individual LH rises (with and without a concomitant progesterone rise) are shown in Figure 2. A total of four LH rises (with
or without a concomitant progesterone rise) were observed in
the ganirelix group versus 28 LH rises in the placebo group. In
one subject of the ganirelix group and six subjects of the placebo group, these LH rises were already observed before the
start of ganirelix/placebo treatment. A statistical comparison
between the two groups showed a statistically significant difference for both the total number of LH rises during the treatment cycle as well as the number of LH rises that occurred
during ganirelix/placebo treatment (P = 0.003 and P = 0.005
respectively). Comparing the incidence of LH rises with concomitant progesterone rises, the difference was significant for
the total number of LH + progesterone rises during the treatment cycle and for the number of these rises during ganirelix/
placebo treatment (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively, see
Table III).
One subject in the ganirelix group (1%) and 17 subjects in
the placebo group (17%) had an LH rise with a concomitant
progesterone rise (value ≥1 ng/ml). In the placebo group, three
subjects with LH values between 30 and 50 IU/l and concomitant progesterone rises ovulated spontaneously prior to HCG.
Among the 32 subjects who had an LH rise, one subject’s cycle
was cancelled because of insufficient ovarian response, two
subjects’ cycles were cancelled because of risk of OHSS, and
three subjects’ cycles were cancelled because of premature ovulation. Among the 26 patients who had premature LH rises and IUI,
there were two miscarriages and three ongoing pregnancies, all in
the placebo group. None of the 17 subjects with both an LH and
progesterone rise became pregnant in the placebo group.
The incidence of premature LH rises prior to the start of
ganirelix or placebo treatment was 1 and 6% respectively
(P > 0.06), which distribution was likely to have been caused
by chance. After excluding subjects with a premature LH rise
prior to the start of drug administration, the difference in the

incidence of LH rises and the incidence of LH + premature LH
rises and luteinization rises was significantly lower in the
ganirelix group. No cases of premature luteinization occurred
during ganirelix treatment whereas 13% of the subjects showed
premature luteinization during placebo treatment.
Serum LH, FSH, E2, and progesterone values
Figure 3 shows the serum hormone profiles during stimulation in
women who received HCG. Both treatment groups had a similar
decrease in the median LH serum values during the first 6 days
of stimulation: from 4.7 and 4.2 IU/l respectively to 2.0 and 2.2
IU/l respectively. After day 6, LH values remained low in subjects treated with ganirelix, whereas those treated with placebo
showed an increase to 4.7 IU/l on the day of HCG. The profiles
for the median values for serum levels of FSH, E2 and progesterone profiles were similar between treatment groups. However,
the placebo group tended to a slightly higher E2 level at day 8
and to a higher progesterone level at the end of stimulation.
Follicle growth
In the patients who received HCG, the number of follicles ≥11,
≥14 and ≥18 mm on the last ultrasonography before HCG
injection was comparable between treatment groups. The mean
± SD number of follicles ≥11, ≥14 and ≥18 mm was respectively
4.0 ± 2.4 versus 3.8 ± 3.5, 2.6 ± 1.3 versus 2.5 ± 2.0 and 1.3 ±
0.6 versus 1.2 ± 1.0 in the ganirelix group and placebo group.
636

Ongoing pregnancies
There were in total 15 biochemical pregnancies and two miscarriages in the ganirelix group and 16 biochemical pregnancies
and four miscarriages in the placebo group. The clinical pregnancy rate (with heart activity) per started cycle was 13.6%
(95% CI: 7.6–21.8) and 13.0% (7.1–21.2) and the ongoing pregnancy rate per started cycle was 12.6% (6.9–20.6) and 12.0%
(6.4–12.0) in the ganirelix and placebo groups respectively. The
ongoing pregnancy rate of subjects with IUI was 14.0% in the
ganirelix group and 14.1% in the placebo group. In each group,
two patients carried twins, thus the incidence of twin pregnancies was 15.4 and 16.7% in the ganirelix and placebo groups
respectively. There were no higher-order multiple pregnancies.

Discussion
This study demonstrates that treatment with ganirelix during
mild stimulation with rFSH for IUI significantly reduces the
number of premature LH rises and premature luteinization (LH
rises + progesterone rises) that may result in spontaneous
ovulation, from 17% in the placebo group to 1% in the ganirelix group and 13 and 0% respectively after exclusion of the
subjects with elevations before ganirelix or placebo had been
given. The incidence of premature LH rises prior to the start of
ganirelix or placebo treatment was 1 and 6% respectively,
which difference is mainly caused by chance. When excluding

Ganirelix effectively prevents premature LH surges in stimulated IUI

subjects with a premature LH rise prior to the start of drug
administration, the difference in the incidence of LH rises
and the incidence of LH + progesterone rises was still substantially lower in the ganirelix group. No cases of premature luteinization occurred during ganirelix treatment whereas 13% of
the subjects showed premature luteinization during placebo
treatment.
These differences in number of LH and progesterone rises
are reflected in the median serum LH and progesterone values,
which reached higher values in the placebo group at the end of
the stimulation period. In studies investigating the effects of
GnRH agonist treatment in HMG/IUI (Dodson et al., 1991;
Sengoku et al., 1994), a similar suppressive effect of the GnRH
analogue on premature luteinization has been observed.
In a study comparing daily versus alternate day administration of FSH in IUI in which all patients received ganirelix, no
cases of progesterone and/or LH rise on the day of HCG were
found (Ragni et al., 2004).
In the current double-blind study the applied treatment regimen was flexible with respect to the FSH starting dose and its

dose increments, allowing investigators to keep close to their
own routine practice. Regardless of this flexibility, the duration
of stimulation, the total dose of rFSH and the number of follicles at the day of HCG was the same in the two treatment
groups.
Our observed higher incidence of premature LH surges in
the placebo group did not result in a higher treatment failure
rate in this group of subjects. The occurrence of a premature
LH surge resulted in treatment cancellation in only three subjects (3% in placebo group), because of spontaneous ovulation.
In this trial serum LH and progesterone were measured by
central laboratory and, as in routine practice, treating physicians were not aware that premature luteinization occurred
unless follicles arrested their growth or ruptured. Three subjects with LH and progesterone rises showed follicular rupture
of the largest follicle(s) as observed by ultrasound. These cases
were recorded as spontaneous ovulation. Apart from cycle cancellation due to premature ovulation, premature luteinization
may impair the overall success rates and typically in the current trial none of the subjects with premature luteinization

became pregnant. This favours the idea that premature luteinization may have less favourable effects on oocyte quality, fertilization and implantation (Loumaye, 1990). However, in this
study the considerably reduced incidence of premature luteinization in the ganirelix group did not increase the pregnancy
rate in this group. Similar results have been reported in previous IUI studies on the effect of GnRH agonist/HMG treatment
compared to HMG alone (Dodson et al., 1991; Sengoku et al.,
1994). These studies also observed that the addition of GnRH
agonist treatment did not result in an increased pregnancy rate,
despite an effective reduction of premature luteinization. These
results suggest that the success rates of IUI are only modestly
affected by premature luteinization in comparison to other factors, such as the timing of triggering of ovulation and insemination.
Nevertheless, depending on the stimulation protocol
applied, GnRH antagonist treatment may be considered for
each patient undergoing IUI, especially for those with previous proven luteinization or spontaneous ovulation. In the current study, the duration of ganirelix treatment was only 3 days
and the amount of rFSH needed to reach the same criteria for
HCG was not increased by the GnRH antagonist. Because a
low-dose, individualized rFSH treatment was used in this
study, the median total rFSH dose was ∼550 IU over a period
of 8 days only. This rFSH amount is less than half of the
amount needed with the conventional and more aggressive
gonadotrophin protocols in IUI treatment (Dodson et al.,1991;
Sengoku et al.,1994,1999).
In the current study, the ongoing pregnancy rates per initiated cycle were similar in both treatment groups: 12.6 and
12.0% for the ganirelix and placebo groups respectively.
Importantly, the low-dose rFSH regimen was not associated
with any high-order multiple gestations. The pregnancy rates
are within the range of success rates reported for conventional
COS/IUI studies per stimulated cycle, i.e. 8–18% (Dodson
et al.,1991; Sengoku et al.,1994; Hannoun et al.,1998; Guzick
et al.,1999; Goverde et al.,2000; Matorras et al.,2002) and
those of one recent open-label assessor-blind study comparing
ganirelix versus no GnRH antagonist in IUI, i.e. 7–12%
(Williams et al.,2004); but the rates are markedly lower than
those reported by others, i.e. 34–38% (Ragni et al., 2004;
Gomez-Palomares et al.,2005). Each of these studies was relatively small, but the current larger study was also not designed
to assess a possible clinical relevant difference in pregnancy
rates. Whether GnRH antagonist treatment indeed improves
success rates by preventing premature luteinization and ovulation should be assessed in a much larger trial, in which the
criteria for giving HCG are strict, to prevent advanced stimulation in the GnRH antagonist treatment group resulting in more
ovulatory follicles and therefore in a higher (multiple) pregnancy rate.
Nevertheless, to improve the convenience for clinics in daily
practice, less-restrictive demands for timing of insemination
may be desired. Prevention of premature luteinization could
reduce the strict requirements for timing of HCG injection and
insemination, thus making the demands for extensive monitoring superfluous. Treatment with a GnRH antagonist at the end
of stimulation prior to IUI may lower the cancellation risk for
