Objective: To determine the difference between two laparoscopic methods for the management of endometriomas with regard to recurrence of signs and symptoms and pregnancy rate.
Design: Prospective, randomized clinical trial.
Setting: Infertility and gynecologic endoscopy units of two medical university hospitals.
Patient(s): <n>One hundred</n> patients with endometriomas who had either infertility or pelvic pain.
Intervention(s): Patients were randomly divided into two groups; one group underwent cystectomy (group 1),
and fenestration and coagulation were performed for the other (group 2).
Main Outcome Measure(s): A comparison of recurrence of signs and symptoms of endometriomas and
pregnancy rates in two groups.
Result(s): Fifty-two patients were studied in group 1 and 48 in group 2. The recurrence of symptoms, such
as pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, was 15.8% in group 1 and 56.7% in group 2 after 2 years. The rate of
reoperation was 5.8% in group 1 and 22.9% in group 2 and these differences were statistically signiﬁcant. The
cumulative pregnancy rate was signiﬁcantly higher in group 1 (59.4%) than in group 2 (23.3%) at 1-year
follow-up.
Conclusion(s): Laparoscopic cystectomy of endometriomas is a better choice than fenestration and coagulation because the former technique leads to a lower recurrence of signs and symptoms and a lower rate of
reoperation and a higher cumulative pregnancy rate than the latter. (Fertil Steril௡ 2004;82:1633–7. ©2004 by

Endometriosis is an enigmatic disorder that
is frequently underdiagnosed and inadequately
treated (1). Endometriotic cysts are among the
most common ovarian cysts encountered at
surgery (2). Several studies have shown that
the treatment of ovarian endometriomas by
laparoscopy is as effective as or even more
effective than treatment by laparatomy (3). In
particular, minimal and mild endometriosis,
which accounts for most peritoneal lesions according to the revised American Fertility Society (AFS) classiﬁcation (4), can be easily eliminated at endoscopy. The moderate forms of

endometriosis, which include unilateral endometriomas and bilateral small ovarian cysts
with limited adhesions, can be successfully
treated by laparoscopy (5). However, the best
laparoscopic technique for the management of
ovarian endometriomas has yet to be determined (6).
In general, endometriomas are removed by
excising the cyst wall. However, it has been
consistently demonstrated that simple cyst aspiration is associated with an unacceptably
high lesion recurrence rate (or possibly persis1633

tence) (7–10). Therefore, some investigators prefer to drain
endometriomas followed by ablasion of the cyst wall using a
laser or electrocoagulation (11, 12). A few articles have been
published that evaluate and compare cystectomy of endometriomas vs. fenestration and coagulation (13), but only
one was a true prospective, randomized study (14).
In our prospective study, we assessed and compared the
recurrence rate of ovarian endometriomas and their symptoms, such as pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, after fenestration and coagulation or cystectomy and reoperation rates for
both of these methods. We also evaluated the pregnancy rate
of infertile patients after performing each procedure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From March 1998 to December 2001, patients who underwent laparoscopy for endometriomas Ն3 cm participated
in this study at two university hospitals. This study was
approved by the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Institutional Review Board. Patients who had previously undergone surgical treatment of endometriosis or who had
received estrogen-suppressing drugs, such as oral contraceptive pills, danazole, or decapeptyl, in the last 6 months were
excluded from the study.
Operative laparoscopies were performed under general
anesthesia by video control. All patients who underwent
laparoscopy were randomly chosen by computerized randomization. Randomization was done before surgery. Patients were aware of the two methods of surgery, but they
and the surgeon did not know which one was better. All
patients gave informed consent. All operations were performed by the ﬁrst author.
The technique was done by one subumblical incision and
two or three lower abdominal incisions. Instrumentation
included 5-mm scissors and graspers. Hemostasis was
achieved with bipolar coagulation, and irrigation was performed with 5% dextrose solution. Lysis of adhesions was
performed by sharp dissection to fully mobilize the ovaries.
All areas of superﬁcial active endometriosis involving the
other ovary or the pelvic peritoneum were fulgurated.
In group 1, the inner lining of the cysts was dissected
from the ovary by two atraumatic grasping forceps that were
pulled in opposite directions, and the inner linings were sent
for histologic examination. In group 2, a 1.5 ϫ 1.5 cm
biopsy was performed and sent for histologic examination
followed by bipolar coagulation of the inner lining.
Endometriosis was classiﬁed according to the revised
AFS classiﬁcation (4). Before surgery, each patient was
asked to record the presence and severity of pelvic pain on a
10-cm linear analogue scale (15). A score of 1– 4 was considered mild pain and was not included in this study because
of similarities between pain due to endometriosis and nonendometriotic pain in this score range. A score of 5–7

indicated moderate pain, and 8 –10, severe pain. Both of
these ranges were included in this study.
There were no intra- or postoperative complications, and
all patients were discharged the day after surgery in both
groups. All patients who had tried to conceive without success for at least 1 year and who had no other obvious causes
of infertility (anovulation, male factor, and anatomic factors)
were considered as infertile in this study.
After the operation, none of the patients were excluded
from the study, and the dropout rate was zero. Patients were
followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery.
At each visit, a gynecological examination and transvaginal
ultrasound were performed. The occurrence of a pregnancy
was recorded by the presence of an intrauterine gestational
sac on ultrasound. During 1 year after operation, the infertile
patients did not use any medication for infertility.
When pregnancy did not occur spontaneously in 12
months after the operation, we considered it a failure and
another modality, such as intrauterine insemination or IVF,
was performed for the patients. Therefore, the pregnancy
rate was evaluated until 1 year after surgery but recurrence of
pain and cyst formation as well as reoperation were compared with the two groups throughout the 24 months after
operation. The criteria for reoperation were based on disease
recurrence and was evaluated by the ﬁrst author.
Disease recurrence was documented by the presence of a
persistent round-shaped, thick-walled cyst Ͼ3 cm, which
was ﬁlled with low echogenic ﬂuid on ultrasound. All of the
14 patients who underwent reoperation had at least one
endometrioma Ͼ3 cm in the ovaries. At each visit the
symptoms were evaluated again. The histologic reports of
the patients were checked and conﬁrmed endometriomas in
all cases.
Statistical evaluation was performed using SPSS 11.5
(SPSS, Chicago, IL). Appropriate statistical tests were used
for comparison, including Fisher’s exact test, ␹2 test, and
two sample t-tests.

RESULTS
We studied 52 patients with endometriomas in the cystectomy group (group 1) and 48 in the fenestration and
coagulation group (group 2). The numbers were not the same
in the two groups because of the number of patients who
completed the follow-up period. The clinical characteristics
of both groups are shown in Table 1. The data were not
statistically different except for the size of the cysts and the
revised AFS score in stage IV dysmenorrheic patients, but
not in the total or infertile patients, which were signiﬁcantly
higher in the cystectomy group than in the fenestration and
coagulation group. These occurred accidentally.

operation rate were not statistically signiﬁcant between the
cystectomy and fenestration and coagulation groups (Table 2).
However, the recurrence of symptoms (pain, dysmenorrhea) (PϽ.001) and the reoperation rate (PϽ.003) were
signiﬁcantly lower in the cystectomy group than in the
fenestration and coagulation group after 2 years (Table 3).
There were 19 pregnancies among 32 infertile patients in
group 1 (59.4%) and 7 pregnancies among 30 infertile patients in group 2 (23.3%) after 1 year of follow-up (Fig. 1),
which is statistically signiﬁcant (PϽ.009). No infertility
medications or procedures were used for infertile patients
until 1 year after surgery.

few articles have been published about the comparison of
cyst excision vs. drainage and coagulation. Two of these
articles discussed the recurrence of endometriomas (3, 11),
and two others evaluated both the above factor and the
postoperative conception rate (12, 14). Just one article is a
prospective, randomized controlled trial study (14).

DISCUSSION

In our prospective, randomized trial, the pain recurrence
was lower in the cystectomy group (15.8%) than in the
fenestration and coagulation group (56.7%) (PϽ.001); in
addition, patients remained asymptomatic longer in the ﬁrst
group. This is similar to Beretta et al.’s study (14), in which
the cystectomy group had a lower recurrence rate of deep
dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain in
24 months than the fenestration and coagulation group.

To ﬁnd the best technique for treatment of endometriomas, we searched MEDLINE from January 1980 to November 2003. As Vercellini et al. (13) have also mentioned, very

three groups who underwent fenestration and coagulation,
laparoscopic cystectomy, and cystectomy by laparatomy.
Our results are similar to Beretta et al.’s (14), who showed
that there is no statistically signiﬁcant difference in the rate
of disease recurrence between cystectomy (6.2%) and drainage and coagulation of endometriomas (18.8%).
In our study, we used ultrasound to detect the recurrence
of cysts. Alcazar et al. (16) demonstrated that transvaginal
ultrasound had an 88% accuracy rate in the diagnosis of
endometriomas.
The third ﬁnding in our study is the reoperation rate,
which is signiﬁcantly lower in the cystectomy group than in
the fenestration and coagulation group. This is similar to
Saleh and Tulandi (3), who reported that the cumulative
probability of reoperation was signiﬁcantly lower after excision than after fenestration. They concluded that during
fenestration, the cyst wall was left in situ and ablasion did
not seem to destroy the tissue adequately.

and drainage of the cyst. It was not explained in their study
whether there was any difference between the complete
removal and excision of the cyst and the stripping of the
lining. They also used danazol in their patients for 8 months
after the operation, which would interfere with the result. It
can be concluded that there was no statistically signiﬁcant
difference in the recurrence of endometriosis in these four
groups in their study, although they did not discuss the
recurrence rate of endometriomas.
In our study, symptom recurrence after 1 year in the
cystectomy group was lower than in the fenestration and
coagulation group. However, this difference was statistically
insigniﬁcant. One possible explanation is that endometriosis
is a chronic disease and that most of its recurrences happen
over a long time period.
In our study, the size of the cysts in the cystectomy group
was bigger than in the fenestration and coagulation group,
and this difference was statistically signiﬁcant. However, the
recurrence of symptoms in the cystectomy group, in spite of
bigger cysts, was lower, which shows that the cystectomy is
a better option.
The second observation in this study is that the recurrence
of the cysts in the fenestration and coagulation group was
higher (31.3%) compared with the cystectomy group
(17.3%) after 2 years, but these values are not statistically
signiﬁcant (PϽ.16).
Hemmings et al. (12) showed that there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in recurrence rate among the
1636 Alborzi et al.

Endometriomas: cystectomy or coagulation

The most important advantage obtained with cystectomy
of endometriomas is the pregnancy rate, which was signiﬁcantly higher in the cystectomy group than in the fenestration and coagulation group after 1 year. More than half of
the patients who underwent cystectomy conceived in 1 year
after the operation (59.4%). This is comparable to the pregnancy rate that was reported by Beretta et al. (66.7%) (14),
Adamson et al. (62%) (17), and Bateman et al. (42.8%) (18)
after laparoscopic cystectomy of endometriomas. On the
other hand, Hemmings et al. (12) reported that the average
time to the ﬁrst conception was signiﬁcantly shorter in the
fenestration and coagulation group than in the cystectomy
group either by laparoscopy or laparatomy. But in Hemmings et al.’s study (12), which was retrospective, the number of patients in the fenestration and coagulation group was
much higher than in the laparoscopic cystectomy group (80
vs. 23), and they did not mention the medications and
methods used for the treatment of infertility after surgery.
One of the theoretical advantages of the cystectomy of
endometriomas compared with fenestration and coagulation
could be that the diagnosis of ovarian lesions, like endometrioid cancer, is more accurate in this technique, although
we found no malignancy in all of the histological samples
obtained during cystectomy or fenestration and coagulation
or in the follow-up of these patients during the 24 months
after the operation.
Some investigators showed that cystectomy can cause
reduced follicular response in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation cycles (19); however, others could not ﬁnd follicles in the histologic specimens of excised tissue after
cystectomy (3) and suggested that postcystectomy ovarian
response to gonadotropins was comparable to the contralateral ovary (2). More data are needed to deﬁnitely prove this
issue.
Vol. 82, No. 6, December 2004

In conclusion, we found that laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy was associated with better outcomes in pregnancy rates
and the relief of pain than fenestration and coagulation of
endometriomas and had a lower rate of reoperation even in
larger cysts. As a result, we recommend that cystectomy of
the endometriomas is a better option than fenestration and
coagulation, especially in patients with infertility and pelvic
pain.
