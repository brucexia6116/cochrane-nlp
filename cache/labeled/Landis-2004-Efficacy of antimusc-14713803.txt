ABSTRACT

Purpose: We analyze the efficacy of tolterodine extended release (ER) for overactive bladder in
patients with severe incontinence.
Materials and Methods: Patients with urinary frequency (8 micturitions or greater per 24
hours), urge incontinence (5 episodes or greater a week) and symptoms of overactive bladder for
6 months or greater were randomized to treatment with 4 mg tolterodine ER once daily or placebo
for 12 weeks. Severe incontinence was defined as 21 episodes or greater per week at baseline.
Changes in the number of incontinence episodes per week and micturition frequency after 12
weeks were compared between treatments.
Results: A total of <n>986</n> patients were eligible for this post-hoc analysis. After 12 weeks
tolterodine ER produced a significant absolute median reduction in incontinence episodes per
week compared to placebo (9.0 vs 5.0, p Ͻ0.0001). For patients with severe incontinence at
baseline median absolute and percentage reductions in incontinence episodes per week were
significantly greater with tolterodine ER than placebo (21.0 vs 9.5, p Ͻ0.0001; 67.6% vs 29.8%,
p ϭ 0.022). Micturition frequency decreased (p Ͻ0.02) and volume voided per micturition
(p Ͻ0.0001) increased significantly more with tolterodine ER compared with placebo in these
patients. For patients with nonsevere incontinence at baseline median reductions in incontinence
episodes per week were also significantly greater with tolterodine ER than placebo (6.0 vs 4.0,
p Ͻ0.0001; 71.4% vs 38.5%, p ϭ 0.026).
Conclusions: Patients with more severe incontinence at baseline achieved greater absolute
reductions in incontinence with tolterodine compared to those with less severe symptoms. The
degree of improvement, as measured by percent change, was comparable across the entire range
of baseline incontinence severity strata. Benefits of antimuscarinic therapy may be greater in
these patients than previously reported.
KEY WORDS: urinary incontinence, bladder, antimuscarinic agents

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition encompassing a
number of urinary symptoms, including urgency, excessive
frequency of micturition, nocturia and urge incontinence.1
The exact nature and severity of these symptoms and the
impact they have on patients can vary considerably among
individuals. For instance, some patients may experience incontinence on a daily basis while others may have symptoms
of urgency and/or frequency without being incontinent.
Urge incontinence is the most distressing symptom of OAB
and is associated with a significantly reduced quality of life.2
Antimuscarinic therapy is the mainstay of pharmacological
treatment for the symptoms of OAB and the efficacy of these
agents (immediate release formulations) in reducing the
number of urge incontinence episodes in patients with OAB
has been reported.3–5 Recently developed once daily extended
release (ER) formulations have further improved the clinical
effectiveness of these antimuscarinic agents.6 However,
there are little data on how differences in symptom severity
affect antimuscarinic treatment outcomes.

Incontinence is often the key symptom associated with the
assessment of OAB symptom severity and the decision to
pharmacologically treat patients.7 In addition, patients with
more severe symptoms are typically those most likely to seek
treatment, and it is a common perception that these patients
are more difficult to treat.8 In view of these potential severity
subgroup differences we performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis of patients with nonsevere and severe incontinence at
baseline treated with tolterodine ER in a 12-week randomized, placebo controlled trial.
METHODS

Patients 18 years old or older with urinary frequency (8
micturitions or greater per 24 hours), urge incontinence (5
episodes or greater a week) and symptoms of OAB for at least
6 months were enrolled into a multinational, randomized,
double-blind, placebo controlled trial conducted at 159 centers in North America, Europe and Australia/New Zealand.
Recruitment was solely on the basis of urinary symptoms,
irrespective of prior antimuscarinic treatment and response
to such treatment. Following a 1-week run-in period during
which baseline urinary symptoms were recorded, patients
were randomized to treatment with 4 mg tolterodine ER once
daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Detailed description of the
patients and study methods have been published previously.9
For this post-hoc analysis the number of incontinence episodes per week was used to define the severity of disease at

Of the 1,529 patients randomized into the original study
with 3 treatment arms (tolterodine ER, immediate release
tolterodine or placebo) 986 were eligible for this analysis
(tolterodine ER 492, placebo 494). Analysis of efficacy was
performed on all randomized patients on an intent-to-treat
basis using the last observation carried forward. The percentage of patients who had last observations carried forward
was 13.56% (placebo 13.73%, tolterodine ER 13.4%) in the
nonsevere urge incontinence subgroup and 14.79% (placebo
19.05%, tolterodine ER 10.53%) in the severe incontinence
subgroup. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the total population, as well as the severe and nonsevere subgroups are detailed in table 1. Mean patient age
was 61 years and the majority were women (82%). More than
half (53%) of the patients had previously received pharmacological treatment for OAB, of whom 42% had experienced
poor efficacy. The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between treatment groups for each of
the 7 progressively more severe incontinence subgroups.
The median number of incontinence episodes at baseline
was similar in both groups (16 and 18 episodes per week,
respectively). The treatment groups were also comparable
with regard to the distribution of patients according to baseline incontinence severity, although a higher proportion of
patients in the placebo group than the tolterodine ER group
had 21 incontinence episodes or greater a week (55.1% vs
44.9%, p Ͻ0.05). In the severe incontinence subgroup the
median number of urge incontinence episodes per week was
comparable in the tolterodine ER and placebo groups (34 vs
31.5, respectively). In patients with non-severe urge incontinence at baseline the median micturition frequency was
greater in the placebo group compared with the tolterodine
group (10.28 vs 9.57, p Ͻ0.02).
After 12 weeks overall absolute median reductions in incontinence episodes per week were 9.0 in the tolterodine ER
group and 5.0 in the placebo group (p Ͻ0.0001), corresponding to a median percent reduction of 70.8% in the tolterodine
ER group and 34.1% in the placebo group. The distribution of
the percentage change in urge incontinence episodes is
shown in figure 1.
In patients with 21 incontinence episodes or greater per
week at baseline median absolute reductions after 12 weeks
were significantly greater (p Ͻ0.0001) with tolterodine ER
(21.0 episodes per week) compared with placebo (9.5 episodes
per week) (mean changes of Ϫ23.5 Ϯ 25.5 vs Ϫ12.0 Ϯ 21.0
episodes per week, respectively). These changes correspond
to a median percent reduction of 67.6% in the tolterodine ER

episodes a week and severe incontinence defined as 21 or
more episodes a week. Changes in the number of incontinence episodes per week, micturition frequency and volume
voided per micturition after 12 weeks are reported for these
baseline severity subgroups as well as for all patients.
Changes were compared between treatments on an absolute
change scale and a percentage change scale, using generalized Mantel-Haenszel procedures,10 based on rank scores,
resulting in p values adjusted for baseline stratification factors within each of the 2 baseline subgroups classified as
nonsevere incontinence and severe incontinence. To confirm
the robustness of the treatment effect within narrow ranges
of baseline severity, within each of these 2 baseline severity
subgroups these analyses were conducted under progressively more stringent adjustment criteria beginning with no
adjustments, then adjustments for clinical center only and
finally, adjustments for multiple baseline severity subgroups
and for clinical center. Since the change data were not normally distributed, median changes and median percent
changes in urinary variables are also reported.

for 4 baseline severity subgroups and 159 clinical centers,
table 2). Micturition frequency also decreased to a significantly (p Ͻ0.02) greater extent with tolterodine ER than
placebo in the severe incontinence subgroup patients with
median decreases of 1.9 vs 0.4 episodes per 24 hours (17.4%
vs 4.5%). For patients with severe incontinence median volume voided per micturition increased significantly more in
the tolterodine ER (27.0 ml, p Ͻ0.0001) group compared with
the placebo group (2.9 ml).
After 12 weeks of treatment the median reduction in incontinence episodes were significantly greater (p Ͻ0.0001)
with tolterodine ER (6 episodes per week) compared with
placebo (4 episodes per week) for patients with nonsevere
incontinence at baseline (5 to 20 incontinence episodes per
week). Median percentage reductions were 71.4% and 38.5%,
with tolterodine ER and placebo, respectively (p ϭ 0.026,
adjusting for 3 baseline severity subgroups and 159 clinical
centers (table 2). Similar to patients with severe incontinence, micturition frequency decreased to a significantly

(p Ͻ0.04) greater extent with tolterodine ER compared with
placebo (median decreases 1.22 vs 0.85 episodes per 24 hours,
13.8% vs 7.7%) for patients with nonsevere incontinence.
Median volume voided per micturition increased to a significantly greater extent in the tolterodine ER (24.0 ml,
p Ͻ0.0001) group compared with the placebo group (4.0 ml).
The median reduction in number of incontinence episodes
per week increased with baseline severity in both treatment
groups, with tolterodine ER more effective than placebo irrespective of symptom severity (fig. 2). The median percentage
reduction in number of incontinence episodes per week was
comparable across the whole range of baseline severity strata
(fig. 3).
DISCUSSION

Data on the impact of incontinence severity on antimuscarinic treatment efficacy in patients with OAB are limited. A
pooled analysis of 4 trials of tolterodine revealed that patients with more severe baseline incontinence (3 episodes or

greater per 24 hours) had a 3-fold greater absolute reduction
in incontinence than patients with less severe incontinence
(1 to 2 episodes per 24 hours) after 12 weeks of treatment
(Ϫ4.6 vs Ϫ1.5 episodes per 24 hours).11 However, aside from
this report, severity of incontinence has not previously been
assessed as a factor in antimuscarinic treatment outcome.
As noted in figure 1, the distribution of percentage change
of urge incontinence episodes does not follow the Gaussian
(normal) distribution. As a result, statistical tests for the
significance of treatment comparisons were conducted on
rank scores for the absolute change scale and the percentage
change scale.
Patients with more severe incontinence at baseline
achieved a similar significant percent reduction in incontinence during treatment with tolterodine ER than those with
less severe symptoms. Patients with severe incontinence,
defined as 21 episodes or greater per week (ie equivalent to 3
episodes or greater a day), experienced a median percentage
reduction of 67.6 after 12 weeks of tolterodine ER treatment
compared to a median percentage reduction of 71.4 in the
nonsevere subgroup. The degree of improvement in symptoms, as measured by the percentage change, was comparable across the entire range of baseline incontinence severity
strata. P values derived from treatment group comparisons
using the median absolute change were smaller compared
with those comparisons using median percentage change.
However, the median percentage change is more clinically
relevant, as well as a more conservative measurement of
drug effect, especially for the subgroup with more severe
symptoms at baseline. In general, if the clinical benefit is

755

comparable across the entire range of baseline severity, patients with more severe levels of incontinence at baseline
should also benefit by experiencing larger absolute reductions.
Efficacy measures used to assess treatment of patients
with the symptoms of OAB are subject to a strong placebo
response. For example, in our study overall median reduction
in incontinence episodes per week was 34.1% in the placebo
group. A bladder training effect induced by the use of micturition diaries can probably explain this placebo response.
However, tolterodine ER produced improvements in the
number of incontinence episodes per week, micturitions per
24 hours and volume voided per micturition which were
significantly greater than those achieved with placebo, despite the high placebo response, which is typical of trials in
which patients complete micturition diaries.9, 12
The successful treatment of OAB can be confirmed by an
increase in the volume per void, indicating that the bladder
capacity is greater at the time of micturition. Any increase in
volume voided per micturition should lead to improvement in
the frequency of micturition and ability to avoid incontinence. Indeed, in our study patients receiving tolterodine ER
compared with placebo, experienced a significantly greater
increase in volume voided per micturition, which was paralleled with a significant reduction in the frequency of incontinence episodes and micturitions. This finding implies that
these reductions were due to an increase in bladder capacity
rather than behavioral changes adopted by the patients.
A limitation in assessing the effects of treatment in patients by severity of symptoms is the lack of an accepted
definition for severe incontinence. However, a severity index
developed by Sandvik et al in which severe incontinence is
defined as urine leakage of more than a few drops at least
once a week has been validated and recommended as appropriate for routine use.13 In a clinical validation of this index
patients with severe incontinence had a median of 6 incontinence episodes per 48 hours, which is consistent with the
definition we used for this analysis.14 However, a limitation
of this index is that it is specifically focused on incontinence
and does not consider other symptoms of OAB, such as urgency, frequency of micturition and nocturia. However,
symptoms of urgency and frequency are more common than
urge incontinence and as bothersome.15, 16 Moreover, it has
been estimated that a third of patients with OAB are not
incontinent.17 Thus, it is important to note that the severity
of OAB should not be solely assessed by the number of incontinence episodes. In addition, our results are from a posthoc analysis and were exploratory, and they need to be confirmed in future prospective studies.
CONCLUSIONS

The percentage change in urge incontinence episodes was
stable across 7 progressively more severe baseline incontinence subgroups during 12 weeks of treatment with tolterodine ER. Correspondingly, the degree of absolute reduction in
symptoms increased with increasing severity of incontinence.
Our data refute the perception that severe incontinence is
more difficult to treat. Benefits of antimuscarinic therapy
may be greater in these patients than previously reported in
clinical trials on OAB.
