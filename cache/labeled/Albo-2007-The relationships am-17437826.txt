Purpose: We assessed the relationships among severity measures of urinary incontinence in women with stress predominant
symptoms enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing 2 surgical techniques (Burch colposuspension vs pubovaginal
sling) for stress urinary incontinence.
Materials and Methods: A total of <n>655</n> women underwent a standardized preoperative assessment that included the
Medical, Epidemiological and Social Aspects of Aging questionnaire, Urogenital Distress Inventory, Incontinence Impact
Questionnaire, 3-day voiding diary, 24-hour pad test, a supine empty bladder stress test and Valsalva leak point pressure
measurements. Correlations were estimated using Spearman correlation coefﬁcients and 95% conﬁdence intervals. T tests at
␣ ϭ 0.05 were conducted to compare the distributions of the continuous severity measure between patients with positive and
negative supine empty bladder stress test.
Results: Baseline mean scores on Medical, Epidemiological and Social Aspects of Aging, Urogenital Distress Inventory and
Incontinence Impact Questionnaire were 25.8, 151 and 171, respectively. Mean incontinence episode frequency and pad
weight were 3.2 per day and 43.5 gm, respectively. Supine empty bladder stress test was positive in 218 patients, and 428
patients had valid Valsalva leak point pressure measurements with a mean Valsalva leak point pressure of 80 cm H2O. Weak
to moderate correlations were observed between Medical, Epidemiological and Social Aspects of Aging, incontinence episode
frequency, pad weight, Incontinence Impact Questionnaire and Urogenital Distress Inventory. On the other hand, Valsalva
leak point pressure correlated poorly with all variables measured. The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the supine empty bladder
stress test to predict intrinsic sphincter dysfunction were 49% and 60%, respectively.
Conclusions: Urinary incontinence severity measures correlate moderately with each other at best. While Medical,
Epidemiological and Social Aspects of Aging demonstrated stronger correlations with the other measures of severity and
quality of life, Valsalva leak point pressure did not. Supine empty bladder stress test did not demonstrate a clinically
signiﬁcant association among severity measures.

MEASURES OF SEVERITY OF STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN
lack of a universally accepted severity measure creates
difﬁculty in designing or comparing results in clinical and
epidemiological studies.
A multicenter, randomized clinical trial of the Burch colposuspension compared to the pubovaginal sling for the
treatment of SUI provided an opportunity to examine the
relationship between generally accepted severity measures
including symptom and QOL questionnaires, pad test, voiding diary, supine empty bladder stress test, and urodynamic
measurements in women before undergoing surgery. In addition, we hypothesized that the severity measures would
correlate differently in patients with urodynamic evidence of
ISD compared to those with no ISD, and in patients with
mixed incontinence compared to those with pure stress incontinence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The UITN SISTEr protocol was designed to comply with the
provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved
by the National Institutes of Health and the respective institutional review boards from the 9 clinical sites in the
UITN.6 All patients gave written informed consent before
enrollment. Women were eligible for the trial if they reported predominant symptoms of SUI determined from the
MESA questionnaire,7 displayed urethral hypermobility determined by a Q-tip test and had a positive standardized
volume stress test.
Measurements
Before randomization patients underwent a standardized
preoperative evaluation which included collection of several
measures of severity, that is MESA symptom questionnaire,
UDI, IIQ, 3-day voiding diary, 24-hour pad test, a standardized volume stress test, SEBST and VLPP obtained during
standardized urodynamics testing.
The MESA total score ranges from 0 to 45 and is a sum of
its 2 components, the stress score and the urge score. The
stress component consists of 9 questions regarding the frequency of stress related urine loss. Scores range from 0 to 27
and increase as the frequency of urine loss increases. Similarly the urge index consists of 6 questions regarding the
frequency of urge related urine loss and scores range from 0
to 18.7 For the purposes of this analysis, participants were
classiﬁed as having symptoms of pure stress incontinence if
the MESA urge score was zero and classiﬁed as having
mixed incontinence if the MESA urge score was greater than
zero.
The UDI consists of 3 subscales (obstructive symptoms,
irritative symptoms and stress symptoms). The total UDI
score has a range of 0 to 300 when all questions are
answered. Each subscale score is computed as the mean of
the items contributing to that subscore, and scaled to have
a range from 0 to 100. Scores increase with worsening
QOL.8
The IIQ consists of 4 subscales (activity, travel, social and
emotional). The total IIQ score has a range of 0 to 400.
Subscale scores are scaled to have a range of 0 to 100 and
scores increase with worsening QOL.8
PW is calculated as the difference between total pad
weights before and after the test during a 24-hour period.3
IEF is calculated as the mean number of involuntary epi-

1811

sodes of urine loss per day recorded on the 3-day voiding
diary.
VLPP is reported as the mean vesical pressure at leakage
during a Valsalva maneuver minus mean vesical pressure at
baseline of cystometrogram using atmospheric pressure as
the reference. VLPP was obtained during standardized ﬁlling cystometry with the ﬁrst measurement at a volume of
200 ml and repeated at 100 ml increments until SUI was
observed on at least 2 of 3 Valsalva maneuvers at a given
volume or until maximum cystometric capacity was reached.
Urodynamic ISD was deﬁned as VLPP 60 cm or less. The
urodynamic testing procedures and quality control measures have been described by Nager et al.9
The supine empty bladder stress test was performed in
the supine position with cough and straining maneuvers.10
A positive test was recorded if urethral leakage was observed during any of the maneuvers. Patients with PVR
greater than 100 cc were excluded from this analysis.
We examined the relationship between measures of severity in the entire study population as well as in 2 subgroups of patients, those with urodynamic ISD compared to
patients with no ISD, and among patients with symptoms of
mixed incontinence compared to those with symptoms of
pure stress incontinence.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS® 9.1. Correlations were estimated using Spearman correlation coefﬁcients and 95% CI. To evaluate the association between
SEBST and each of the continuous severity measures, t
tests at ␣ ϭ 0.05 were conducted to compare the distributions of the continuous severity measure between patients
with positive and negative SEBST. The sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of SEBST for ISD was calculated along with
95% CI.
RESULTS
A total of 655 women were randomized between February
2002 and June 2004. Mean age was 52 years (SD 10) with
a range of 28 to 81 years. Mean BMI was 30 kg/m2 (SD 6).
The mean values and ranges for the severity measures
evaluated are shown in table 1. There were 44 women
(7%) with pure stress incontinence, 127 (30%) with ISD
and 226 (37%) with a positive SEBST. The small number
of patients with pure stress incontinence precluded subgroup analysis by type of incontinence symptoms. VLPP
measurements were obtained in 428 patients (65%), and

reasons for missing VLPP data included test artifact (85),
leaked only with prolapse reduction (19), leaked only with
cough (70) and no urodynamic study SUI demonstrated
(53).
There were weak to moderate positive and negative
correlations between the continuous severity measures
(table 2), ranging from a low of 0.01 (CI Ϫ0.11 to 0.08)
between VLPP and UDI to a high of 0.61 (CI 0.56 to 0.66)
between IEF and PW. The correlations between the patient questionnaires (UDI, IIQ and MESA) were uniformly
moderate. The correlation of PW and IEF with the QOL
questionnaires was weak for UDI (0.17 and 0.23, respectively) and moderate with IIQ (0.34 and 0.34, respectively). VLPP was weakly negatively correlated or not at
all correlated with the other severity measures. In the
subgroup analysis of patients with ISD, correlation coefﬁcients between VLPP and the other measures ranged
from – 0.15 to 0.05, demonstrating little to no difference
from the group as a whole.
The associations between the SEBST and each of the
continuous variables are presented in table 3. Mean MESA,
UDI, IIQ and PW did not differ by SEBST result. IEF was
statistically signiﬁcantly higher in patients with a positive
SEBST, with means of 3.7 episodes (SD 3.3) vs 2.9 episodes
per day (SD 2.6) (p ϭ 0.001). In addition, VLPP was significantly lower, statistically but not clinically, for patients
with a positive SEBST vs a negative SEBST, with means of
75 (SD 36) vs 85 cm (SD 36), respectively (p ϭ 0.011). Of the
118 patients with ISD, 58 had a positive SEBST for a sensitivity of 49% (CI 40%, 58%). Of 284 patients with no ISD
113 had a positive SEBST for a speciﬁcity of 60% (CI 54%,
66%).
DISCUSSION
We studied a number of urinary incontinence severity measures among a large cohort of United States women scheduled to undergo surgery for SUI. Only a modest correlation
was observed between patient symptom self-assessment
(MESA) and 2 objective measures of urine loss, voiding diary
(IEF) and pad test (PW). While a stronger correlation was
found between PW and IEF, only modest correlations existed between MESA and the QOL measures (UDI and IIQ).

No correlation was demonstrated between VLPP and the
other continuous severity measures, suggesting that while
VLPP may be a measure of urethral sphincter dysfunction,
it is not associated with patient symptom severity, quantity
of urine loss, or the effect the condition has on patient QOL.
A subgroup analysis in patients with VLPP above and below
the traditional cutoff for ISD (60 cm H2O) failed to demonstrate an improvement in the correlation between VLPP and
the other measures.
The moderate correlations between MESA and the
measures IEF and PW agree with prior studies comparing
validated patient self-assessment tools with more objective measures of incontinence frequency and quantity of
urine loss.3,11,12 Elser et al demonstrated moderate to
strong correlations between patient recall of the number
of pads used and prospectively recorded events on a 7-day
diary and a pad test.11 Stach-Lempinen et al found that
severity measured by a visual analog score correlated
positively with PW and IEF and negatively with MUCP.13
They also found the QOL measure correlated weakly with
PW and IEF, and weakly negative with MUCP. Two other
studies have demonstrated as we have that IEF and PW
correlate better with each other than with patient selfassessment of severity.3,12
VLPP was ﬁrst described as a measure of urethral
sphincter function.5 Subsequently a number of studies
reported signiﬁcant correlation between VLPP and measures of incontinence severity including Stamey grade,5,14
SEAPI grade,15 IEF and number of pads.16 Comparisons
among these studies and with the data reported here are
difﬁcult due to the varying deﬁnitions of severity used.
Other investigators have reported minimal or absent correlation between VLPP and severity measures.14,17 Nager et
al performed correlation analysis on women enrolled in a
multicenter trial for a urethral bulking agent.14 They used
the Stamey grading system as a subjective measure of severity, the SEAPI-QMM for a QOL measure, a 7-day voiding
diary to assess IEF, and VLPP and MUCP as measures of
urethral function. While VLPP correlated negatively (– 0.36)
with incontinence grade as noted in the preceding paragraph, it did not correlate with PW or QOL. Theofrastous et
al performed correlation analysis on several severity measures from 75 women with pure SUI and found weak negative correlations (Ϫ0.2) between urethral function measurements (VLPP, MUCP), and IEF and PW. They demonstrated
no correlation between VLPP and either of the QOL measures (UDI and IIQ).17
The observation that some patients with low MUCP values leaked with Valsalva despite having just voided, led to
the development of the SEBST as a potential method to
screen patients for ISD without having to perform urodynamics.18 Lobel and Sand deﬁned ISD by MUCP criterion

MEASURES OF SEVERITY OF STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN
and reported a sensitivity of 65% to 70%, and a speciﬁcity of
67% to 76% for SEBST to diagnose ISD.18 McLennan and
Bent deﬁned ISD by VLPP criterion and reported a sensitivity of 79% and a speciﬁcity of 62.5%.10 Walter et al subsequently demonstrated that the PVR volume had minimal
impact on the usefulness of the SEBST.19 Ultimately the
test is thought to have a high negative predictive value for a
VLPP less than 60 cm but lacks the sensitivity to make the
diagnosis of ISD.10,18,19 Our data demonstrate a statistically
signiﬁcant association between SEBST and VLPP and IEF.
However, the subtle differences in VLPP (75 vs 84 cm H2O)
and IEF (3.7 vs 2.9) between those with positive and negative SEBST, respectively, are not likely clinically meaningful.
There are a number of potential reasons why incontinence severity measures do not correlate strongly. They
may measure different domains of urinary incontinence,
as has been noted in prior publications of the SISTEr
cohort. Richter et al observed that IEF was positively
associated with BMI (p ϭ 0.003),20 whereas Lemack et al
performed a multivariate analysis on the factors associated with VLPP and found that VLPP was positively
associated with BMI (p ϭ 0.0129).21 These data suggest
that for increasing BMI, severity measured by IEF worsens while severity measured by VLPP improves.
In addition, there may be variability inherent to the
measures. Patient self-assessment, especially by recall, has
well documented limitations.22 Voiding diaries and pad tests
potentially suffer from poor patient compliance, the effect
the test may have on the patient normal voiding habits, the
variation of the condition depending on activity, ﬂuid intake,
and proximity to a bathroom. Lastly, VLPP, while perhaps
an accurate indicator of outlet resistance, does not necessarily reﬂect the bother associated with incontinence (patient
reported severity) and it does not consider how variations in
patient lifestyles may affect their incontinence. For instance, an active woman with VLPP of 100 cm H2O may
experience more frequent incontinence or heavier pad use
than a woman with a lower VLPP of 60 cm H2O who has a
more sedentary lifestyle.
The strengths of this study are the large sample size from
geographically and ethnically diverse sites across the United
States as well as the standardized methods of preoperative
assessment and data collection. The primary limitation is
that it is not representative of the entire population of
women with SUI. Due to the inclusion criteria, the study
population does not include 2 subgroups traditionally considered to have more severe incontinence, those with severe
urge and those with immobile urethras, nor does it include
those women whose symptoms are not severe enough for
them to seek surgery. Therefore, patients at both ends of the
severity spectrum potentially were excluded from this analysis.
These data support the recent recommendations by a
number of guidelines panels on the importance of using
multiple measures to assess incontinence.23 A number of
groups have attempted to combine severity measures into an
incontinence score in an effort to more comprehensively
assess the entire condition. Tools such as the Sandvik severity index24 and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire25 have demonstrated correlation with
the voiding diary and pad test.3,25 Whether these indexes
are more accurate than individual measures requires fur-

1813

ther investigation. Ultimately, for these scores to be clinically useful, it will be important to link severity measures to
quality of life, expectations and satisfaction data.

CONCLUSIONS
This analysis of baseline severity measures from a large
population of women with predominant SUI suggests that
no 2 severity measures are the same. Rather, they appear
to measure different aspects of the incontinence condition
and, thus, are not interchangeable when characterizing a
patient population or assessing outcomes. This has practical implications for clinicians and investigators who are
evaluating the results of new therapies. Before comparing
results we must conﬁrm that similar measures were used
to deﬁne the patient population and to assess the outcomes. To facilitate such comparisons standardized measurement tools should be agreed upon and used by all
investigators. As there is no gold standard for severity
against which these measures can be compared, no conclusions can be drawn about the usefulness of a given
measure. In addition, these data do not address the potential value of these measures as predictors of treatment outcomes or to assist in choosing appropriate
therapy. Further investigation is recommended to evaluate the relationship between these severity measures and
the efﬁcacy and morbidity associated with surgical treatment.
