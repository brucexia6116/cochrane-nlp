Abstract
Aims. The aim of this study was to examine whether a nurse-administered minimal
psychological intervention for depressive symptoms improves diabetes-speciﬁc
quality of life and glycaemic control in older persons with diabetes.
Background. Depression is common among persons with diabetes and may have a
negative impact on diabetes. Interventions aimed at reducing depressive symptoms
may positively inﬂuence diabetes-speciﬁc quality of life as well.
Methods. A pragmatic, randomized controlled trial was carried out comparing the
intervention with usual care among <n>208</n> Dutch primary care patients of ‡60 years with
type 2 diabetes and co-occurring minor to moderate depression. Data on symptom
distress and emotional distress were collected during 2003–2006, and haemoglobin
A1c levels were obtained from general practices. Data were analysed using mixed
model, repeated measures ANCOVA s. Hba1c was collected retrospectively from general practices between December 2006–February 2007. In July 2007 we retrieved
some additional HbA1c data from the medical records of the university hospital.
Results. Only in higher-educated persons did the intervention have statistically
signiﬁcant effect on both emotional distress and symptom distress (DSC-R total score
at 9 months P = 0Æ001; PAID, 9 months P = 0Æ03). Furthermore, we found an effect
on symptom distress in men (9 months P = 0Æ01), and on emotional distress in
persons with a shorter diabetes duration (<7 years) (9 months P = 0Æ04). A significant trend over time for haemoglobin A1c was found in favour of the intervention,
with a statistically signiﬁcant difference between groups after 9 months (P = 0Æ02).
Conclusion. The nurse-administered intervention had limited effects on diabetesspeciﬁc quality of life. As only certain subgroups beneﬁted, ways of increasing
effectiveness in other groups should be explored. The potentially beneﬁcial effect on
glycaemic control is encouraging and needs further research because of small
numbers in the analysis.

Depression treatment and diabetes outcomes

Introduction
Depression is estimated to be the second leading cause of
burden of disease in 2030 worldwide (Mathers & Loncar
2006). A review of studies from several different countries
showed that approximately 17% of all people with type 2
diabetes suffer from depression (Ali et al. 2006). Depression
is associated with lower quality of life (Lustman & Clouse
2005), non-adherence to medical regimens and self-care
behaviours (Gonzalez et al. 2007), DM complications (de
Groot et al. 2001), and higher medical costs and healthcare

utilization (Ciechanowski et al. 2000). Furthermore, depression has a negative impact on physical activity (Gonzalez
et al. 2007), is associated with persistently higher haemoglobin A1c levels over time (Richardson et al. 2008) and may
reduce glycaemic control through central nervous system
regulatory changes (Lustman & Clouse 2005). Diabetes itself
may negatively inﬂuence depression as poor glycaemic
control can induce negative moods (Lustman & Clouse
2005) and physical illness is thought to be a predictor of
poor depression outcome (i.e. no recovery/still depressed)
(Cole et al. 1999). Furthermore, people with diabetes and

with co-occurring depression report a higher number of
diabetes symptoms than persons with diabetes without
depression (Katon et al. 2007).

Background
Given these reciprocal negative consequences, addressing
depressive symptoms is of vital importance to these persons;
it may improve self-care behaviours and thus help reduce the
burden of diabetes in terms of diabetes-speciﬁc symptoms and
emotional distress (Williams et al. 2004). A recent review
showed that non-pharmacological treatments for depression,
like cognitive behavioural therapy and collaborative care,
reduced depressive symptoms, but had limited effect on
glycaemic control (Wang et al. 2008). As this review only
included three studies, it is important to further evaluate the
effects of non-pharmacological interventions for depression
on diabetes-related outcomes. We have previously shown that
a nurse-led minimal psychological intervention (MPI) based
on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and self-management principles reduced depressive symptoms and improved
generic quality of life (Short Form-36) in older persons
with diabetes and co-occurring depression (Lamers et al.
2010).

The study
Aim
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a nurseadministered MPI based on CBT and self-management
principles also improves disease-speciﬁc quality of life and
glycaemic control. We expected that diabetes-speciﬁc quality
of life (i.e. quality of life speciﬁcally focused on areas that are
of interest to persons with diabetes) in older persons with
diabetes and with co-occurring minor or mild to moderate
major depression would improve. Furthermore, we expected
that persons in the intervention group would have better
glycaemic control than persons in the control group.

Design/methodology
We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.
Details of the study protocol have been described elsewhere
(Lamers et al. 2006). Brieﬂy, between October 2003 and
May 2005, persons were recruited from 89 primary care
practices in the south of the Netherlands. First, all persons with type 2 diabetes aged 60 years and over who did not
meet the exclusion criteria were sent a depression screening
questionnaire (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9)
790

(Spitzer et al. 1999). Exclusion criteria were as follows:
treatment with antidepressants for depression, major
psychiatric problems (bipolar depression, schizophrenia,
alcohol or substance abuse), current psychosocial/psychiatric
treatment, serious cognitive problems, on waiting list
for nursing home, bedridden, loss of spouse in last 3 months
and not being ﬂuent in Dutch. All persons who reported (a)
having at least two symptoms for more than half the time and
(b) one of these symptoms being loss of interest or depressed
mood were invited to a diagnostic interview (n = 538). A
trained nurse interviewed people at home using the Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (Sheehan
et al. 1997) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(HDRS) (Hamilton 1960). All persons with minor depression
or mild to moderate major depression were invited to
participate in the study. Persons with severe major depression
(HDRS >18) or suicidal risk were referred to their general
practitioner (GP) as the MPI was deemed insufﬁcient for
persons with a severe depression. In total, 208 persons with
type 2 diabetes and minor depression or mild to moderate
major depression signed informed consent forms and completed a baseline questionnaire (Figure 1). Randomization
was then performed, blinded for the researchers, by an
external agency using a computerized random number
generator with a block randomization scheme stratiﬁed by
general practice (block size of two). Stratiﬁcation was
performed because we expected to include only a small
number of persons per practice and we wanted them equally
spread over groups.

Intervention and usual care
The intervention is a nurse-administered, minimal psychological intervention, consisting of elements of CBT and
self-management. The intervention is called minimal because
it is applied by a nurse to patients with moderate problems,
and because of its length (four visits on average). Regular
CBT provided by a psychologist/psychiatrist normally consists of 10–25 sessions. Its aim was to educate persons to take
responsibility for the daily management of their own illness
and its consequences. The intervention consists of ﬁve steps.
In the ﬁrst step, the nurse explores the participant’s feelings,
cognitions and behaviours. In the second step, the participant
keeps a diary, where he or she records symptoms, complaints,
thoughts, worries, related feelings and behaviour. In the third
step, the participants are challenged to link his or her mood
to the consequent behaviour, using information from the
diary and then the self-management approach is introduced
in a fourth step. In this phase, the participant explores
possibilities to alter his or her behaviour and draws up an

action plan. By changing the behaviour that is linked to the
depressed mood, mood itself can be altered. In the last step,
the progress in achieving the goals of the action plan
is evaluated (Van Eijk et al. 2004, Lamers et al. 2006).
The intervention is tailor-made: the number of visits depends
upon progress. On average, persons in the intervention group
had four intervention sessions of approximately 1 hour.
Four nurses with no speciﬁc mental health expertise
successfully completed a four-day training given by a
psychiatrist, a GP and a psychologist. In the course, the
nurses learned how to detect depression (both major and
minor) and how to treat persons with techniques based upon
self-management and cognitive behavioural therapy (Van
Eijk et al. 2004, Lamers et al. 2006). After the training, all
trainers judged the nurses fully capable of administering the
self-management and CBT-based intervention as intended
based on their performance during role plays, their rating of
video-taped diagnostic interviews and their overall participation during the course. Booster sessions during the full course
of the study further complemented the 4-day course. A
thorough process evaluation showed that the nurses adhered
closely to protocol guidelines (Jonkers et al. 2007).
Persons allocated to the intervention group received the
MPI at home in addition to usual care. Persons allocated to
usual care received regular treatment according to the
practice guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners for type 2 diabetes. These guidelines include regular
follow-up of somatic symptoms, but do not involve the
detection and treatment of depressive symptoms (Rutten
et al. 2006). Co-interventions such as pharmacological
depression treatments were allowed, and considered nondifferential between groups. Only after the follow-up, GPs
were informed about which patients had participated in the
trial.

Data collection
Information about age, gender and educational level was
collected at the time of the PHQ-9 screening. Diabetes
duration and use of insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents
were assessed in the baseline self-administered questionnaire.
Disease-speciﬁc quality of life was operationalized as
diabetes-speciﬁc symptom distress assessed with the Diabetes
Symptom Checklist – Revised (DSC-R) (Grootenhuis et al.
1994), and emotional distress using the Problem Areas in
Diabetes (PAID) questionnaire (Snoek et al. 2000). The PAID
provides one total score ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 being
the most favourable outcome. The DSC-R consists of a total
score and subscores for eight dimensions named: hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, neuropathic pain, sensibility, fatigue,

cognitive distress (i.e. symptoms like sleepiness or drowsiness, difﬁculty concentrating or staying attentive), cardiovascular symptoms and ophthalmological symptoms (i.e. vision
problems like blurred vision, ﬂashes or black spots in ﬁeld of
vision), all ranging from 0 to 10 with 0 being most favourable
outcome. Data were collected from 2003 to 2006 by mailed
self-administered questionnaires. Data were collected at
baseline, and 1 week, 3 and 9 months after the intervention
was completed for intervention patients. The ﬁrst follow-up
measurement for controls was set at 6 weeks after the
baseline measurement, as 6 weeks was the average estimated
time it would take to complete the intervention. Missing item
scores on the DSC-R and PAID were imputed with the
person’s mean item score if at least 50% of the items had
been completed. The number of persons for whom imputation was not possible ranged per follow-up measurement
from 2 to 12 persons for the DSC-R and 3 to 12 persons for
the PAID. The persons for whom imputation was not possible
were evenly distributed over the intervention and control
group.
After the follow-up period, all general practices were
contacted to retrieve participants’ haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
values that were determined between the inclusion phase and
the end of the follow-up (response: 94%). HbA1c is an
indicator of blood glucose control over the previous
2–3 months and is commonly used in diabetes research
(de Rekeneire et al. 2003, Koro et al. 2004). Moreover, the
medical records of persons living in the Maastricht area were
checked for HbA1c data at the University Hospital Maastricht. In total, we retrieved HbA1c data for 135 persons
(65%).

Ethical considerations
Approval for this study was granted by the Medical Ethics
Committee of the university/university hospital. Signed
informed consent was obtained from participants after they
had been informed about the contents of the study.

Data analysis
In the total DELTA (Depression in Elderly with Long-Term
Afﬂictions) study population (of which the 208 persons with
diabetes were a subgroup), the power calculation was based
on improvement in depressive symptoms and has been
described elsewhere (Lamers et al. 2006). Based on an
a = 0Æ05 and b=0Æ9, 2 · 103 persons are sufﬁcient to
detect a minimum clinically relevant difference of 0Æ72 on
the DSC-R total score, 9Æ03 on the PAID and 0Æ59% for
HbA1c.

The data were analysed using SPSS , version 15 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). All analyses were conducted according to
the intention-to-treat principle (i.e. persons were analysed
based on to their treatment allocation, regardless of whether
they actually had received that treatment). Groups were
checked for baseline comparability to identify potential
confounders using chi-square and Student’s t-tests. Mixedeffect, repeated measures ANCOVA models were used to test
the differences in DSC-R and PAID scores between groups at
follow-up. Mixed-effects model include random-effect terms
and are appropriate for representing clustered data, for
instance in repeated measurements in individuals over time.
Age, gender, educational level, treatment group, baseline
value of outcome, time and the product term of time and
group were standard inclusions in the model, and diabetes
medication and duration were added as they were found to
confound the relation between groups and outcome (‡10%
change in the estimate of group when added to the standard
model). Furthermore, for signiﬁcant differences, effect sizes
(d) were calculated by dividing the difference in mean group
scores by the pooled standard deviation. Additional per
protocol analyses were performed for the DSC-R and PAID,
including persons who had received a complete intervention
(i.e. all core steps of the intervention had been delivered,
based on data from the process evaluation, n = 67) (Jonkers
et al. 2007) and excluding six persons from the control group
who responded positively to a contamination check during
data collection. The contamination check consisted of several
questions in the questionnaire of controls. These questions
asked whether the respondent had received information on
(the content) of the intervention and whether they had
received beneﬁt from that knowledge. Anyone responding
with ‘yes’ to one of these questions was considered to be
contaminated. Furthermore, last observation carried forward
(LOCF) analyses were performed. In these analyses, missing
values on outcomes during follow-up were imputed with the
last available score of a given outcome. Possible inﬂuence
from outliers was checked, but not observed.
For HbA1c, we ran two models: one with the time of the
HbA1c measurements on a continuous scale, and one with
their time matched to that of the follow-up measurements
(baseline, 1 week, 3 and 9 months after treatment). This was
done on the condition that the HbA1c was determined within
a 6-week period around the follow-up measurement. Data
from 46 persons (23 control and 26 intervention participants)
who had both a baseline HbA1c and ‡1 follow-up measurements were used in the analyses. The comparability of
persons with and without HbA1c data available was checked.
Persons for whom HbA1c values were available at baseline
and at least one follow-up measurement (n = 49) were more
792

often female, and used insulin and insulin plus oral hypoglycaemic agents signiﬁcantly more often than persons without
available HbA1c data. Mixed-effect, repeated measures
ANCOVA models were used corrected for age, gender, educational level, baseline HbA1c level and time. Diabetes duration
and use of medication were checked for confounding effects,
but did not inﬂuence results and were therefore not added to
the model.

Validity and reliability
Reliability and validity of the PAID have been shown in
several studies (Welch et al. 1997, 2003, Snoek et al. 2000)
with Pearson’s r for test–retest reliability of 0Æ83. In the
current study, Cronbach’s alpha was 0Æ95. A change of six
points on the scale has been said to represent a clinically
meaningful change (Eigenmann et al. 2009). The DSC-R has
been shown to have excellent psychometric properties, with
Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients ranging from 0Æ69 to 0Æ87. In
the current sample, Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients ranged
from 0Æ64 to 0Æ91. The minimal important differences for the
DSC-R domains were ranging from 0Æ00 to 0Æ33 based on
anchor-based method, although the authors state that a
distribution approach of 0Æ5 SD would be more conservative
(Arbuckle et al. 2009).

Results
Figure 1 shows ﬂow of participants in the study. The 128
persons who did not participate in the MINI did not differ
from those who participated in the MINI regarding age,
gender, education and PHQ score. The 45 eligible persons
who chose not to participate were signiﬁcantly older than
those who did. The dropout percentage throughout the
follow-up was comparable between the intervention and
control groups (33% vs. 30%, P = 0Æ62). Dropout was
associated only with higher age and was not associated with
baseline PAID score, baseline DSC-R scores or with treatment arm. Table 1 shows that groups were comparable at
baseline.
The intervention’s effects on quality of life in terms of
symptom distress were limited (Table 2). Only at second
follow-up we did ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant effects on the
ophthalmological symptom subscale (group difference = 0Æ83, P < 0Æ01), on the cognitive stress subscale
(group difference = 0Æ72, P = 0Æ03) and on the total DSC-R
score (group difference = 0Æ57, P < 0Æ01). Effect sizes were
medium: 0Æ45 for the ophthalmological symptom subscale
and total DSC-R score, and 0Æ38 for the cognitive stress
subscale. For quality of life in terms of emotional distress

showed an HbA1c decline over time, whereas persons in the
control group experienced an increase. The difference
between groups after 9 months was statistically signiﬁcant
in favour of the intervention (group difference = 0Æ5%,

added interaction terms per group of gender, age, education
(in tertiles, where low refers to primary school only,
medium refers to lower vocational training or lower general
education, high refers to higher vocational training,
secondary school, higher professional education and university training), medication use and diabetes duration
(based on the median) to the model. Where interaction
terms were statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0Æ10), stratiﬁed
subgroup analyses were performed. Distinct differences
were found for education on both symptom distress and
emotional distress. In the lowest education tertile, persons
in the intervention group on average had worse outcomes
than persons in the control group, with effect sizes of À0Æ67
on the DSC-R and À0Æ65 on the PAID. In the middle and
highest education tertiles, persons in the intervention group

beneﬁted from the intervention and scored signiﬁcantly
higher than persons in the control group (Table 3). Effect
sizes were large on the DSC-R; 1Æ22 for the middle tertile
and 0Æ83–0Æ93 for the highest tertile. On the PAID, the
effect size for the middle tertile was 0Æ77 and for the highest
tertile 0Æ56. These additional analyses also revealed that the
intervention did have signiﬁcant effects on symptom distress
(DSC-R total score) on all follow-up measurements in male
participants (group difference after 9 months = 0Æ7,
P = 0Æ01, d = 0Æ99), but not in female participants (groups
difference after 9 months = À0Æ9, P = 0Æ01, d = À0Æ66).
Furthermore, in persons with a diabetes duration of
<7 years, the intervention group on average had more
favourable scores for emotional distress (PAID) than the
control group at all follow-up measurements, with a

What is already known about this topic
• Depression is common among older persons with
diabetes type 2.
• As depression can negatively inﬂuence diabetes
outcome, interventions to reduce depressive symptoms
are important to reduce disease burden.

What this paper adds
• A short nurse-administered psychological intervention
for depression positively inﬂuences diabetes-speciﬁc
quality of life and glycaemic control.
• Some subgroups seem to beneﬁt less from the
intervention (lower educated persons, women, persons
with diabetes durations of ‡7 years).

Implications for practice and/or policy
• Primary care nurses can potentially play an important
role in the emotional well-being of older persons with
diabetes.
• Possible alterations to the intervention to improve
effectiveness in lower educated, women and those with
a longer diabetes duration need to be explored.
signiﬁcant effect at second follow-up (group difference = 6Æ6, P = 0Æ04, d = 0Æ39). In persons with a diabetes
duration of ‡7 years, the intervention group scored more
favourably only at the last follow-up.

Discussion
The results of the study have to be interpreted with respect to
its limitations. First, persons who dropped out were older
than those who completed all questionnaires, but dropout
was evenly distributed between treatment groups. Second, the
50% missing items cut-off rule used when imputation missing
items may be considered to be on the high side, but it is not
uncommon in calculating scale scores, for instance in the
SF-36 (Ware et al. 1993). Furthermore, the majority of the
persons for whom missing items were imputed had a missing
item rate of £20%. Third, HbA1c data were obtained from
general practices, and although the data give a good
indication of the treatment effect, the number of observations
was limited. HbA1c measurements in all persons at ﬁxed
points during the data collection would have provided
stronger evidence. Finally, post hoc analyses should be
interpreted with caution as signiﬁcant ﬁndings may have
been the result of multiple testing, meaning that some of
796

effects may be ﬁndings due to chance only. Nevertheless, the
patterns observed here are consistent with previously found
patterns of increasing differences over time (Lamers et al.
2010), which reduced the probability of our ﬁndings being
chance ﬁndings.
Overall, the nurse-administered minimal psychological
intervention had a moderate effect on disease-speciﬁc
quality of life. Additional analyses revealed that it beneﬁted
symptom distress in male participants, but not in female
participants, while emotional distress was more often
improved in persons who had had diabetes for less than
7 years. Reasons for these differences are unknown to us.
Older persons in the lowest education tertile on average did
not beneﬁt from the intervention. Effects of the intervention
on symptom and emotional distress were only found in the
middle and highest education tertile. These effects represented clinically relevant effects, with medium to large effect
sizes. Furthermore, we found a difference in mean HbA1c
level in favour of the intervention after 9 months, with a
statistically signiﬁcant difference between groups in trend
over time.
We found no effect on diabetes-speciﬁc quality of life in
persons in the lowest education tertile. As persons with a
lower socioeconomic status already are at higher risk for
diabetes complications (Larranaga et al. 2005), it is important to identify the factors related to this diminished response
and evaluate the extent to which adaptations can be made to
the intervention to improve its effectiveness for this group.
Persons with higher educational levels may proﬁt more as a
result of a better (cognitive) understanding of the principles
of the intervention and a better availability of material (e.g.
ﬁnancial) and non-material (social support) resources, allowing them to more easily incorporate selfmanagement in their
daily lifestyles when compared with persons with lower
education levels. Interestingly, Arean et al. found that lower´
income older persons experienced similar beneﬁts on depression outcomes to those of the higher-income older persons
from depression care management and problem-solving
therapy. However, ongoing care management of up to a year
was recommended for lower-income persons, as their physical functioning improved more slowly than that of higherincome persons (Arean et al. 2007). These ﬁndings suggest
that booster sessions or some other form of follow-up
support in everyday self-management skills may improve
outcomes for persons with lower socioeconomic status.
Another explanation may be that higher health literacy in
higher-educated persons caused the stronger effects in this
group.
The intervention’s effect on glycaemic control is interesting, as most other studies have failed to ﬁnd similar effects

through depression treatment. Only one small trial showed
that persons receiving CBT and education had signiﬁcantly
better glycaemic control than those receiving education only
(Wang et al. 2008). Several smaller trials evaluating
antidepressant treatment found either no effects (Lustman
et al. 2000, Paile-Hyvarinen et al. 2007) or adverse effects on
glycaemic control (Lustman et al. 1997). However, whether
a difference of 0Æ5% is clinically relevant is debatable,
although the lower the HbA1c is the better. Moreover,
changes in medication during follow-up may have inﬂuenced
outcomes. The suggestion that CBT-based depression treatments improve glycaemic control is certainly worth further
investigation on a larger scale with protocol-based follow-up
measurements.
Furthermore, this study showed that primary care nurses
may successfully administer short interventions aimed at
reducing depressive symptoms in persons with diabetes. By
incorporating such interventions in existing disease-management programmes, in which nurses already play a large role,
quality of care may be enhanced by giving more attention to
the emotional aspects of having diabetes. However, to
achieve the aim of the intervention – to get persons to take
responsibility for the daily management of their own illness
and its consequences – it is vital that nurses take on a
supporting and facilitating role.

Conclusions
To conclude, although the effectiveness of the nurse-led
minimal psychological intervention in reducing depressive
symptoms and improving generic quality of life has been
previously established, this study showed that a nurseadministered minimal psychological intervention improved
diabetes-speciﬁc quality of life, but only in certain subgroups.
As some groups of persons did not beneﬁt, ways of increasing
the intervention’s beneﬁcial effects in these groups, such as
adding follow-up meetings, should be explored. Likewise, the
potentially beneﬁcial effect of the MPI on glycaemic control
found in this study needs further examination. Nevertheless,
primary care nurses can potentially play an important role in
monitoring and inﬂuencing the emotional well-being of older
persons with diabetes.
