abstract
background

Although zidovudine prophylaxis decreases the rate of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 substantially, a large number of infants still become
infected. We hypothesized that the administration, in addition to zidovudine, of a single
dose of oral nevirapine to mothers during labor and to neonates would further reduce
transmission of HIV.
methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of three treatment regimens in Thai
women who were receiving zidovudine therapy during the third trimester of pregnancy. In one group, mothers and infants received a single dose of nevirapine (nevirapine–
nevirapine regimen); in another, mothers and infants received nevirapine and placebo,
respectively (nevirapine–placebo regimen); and in the last, mothers and infants received
placebo (placebo–placebo regimen). The infants also received one week of zidovudine
therapy and were formula-fed. The end point of the study was infection with HIV in the
infants, established by virologic testing.
results

Between January 15, 2001, and February 28, 2003, a total of <n>1844</n> Thai women were enrolled. At the first interim analysis, the independent data monitoring committee stopped
enrollment in the placebo–placebo group. Among women who delivered before the interim analysis, the as-randomized Kaplan–Meier estimates of the transmission rates
were 1.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.3 to 2.2) in the nevirapine–nevirapine
group and 6.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.8 to 8.9) in the placebo–placebo group (P<0.001). The final per-protocol transmission rate in the nevirapine–nevirapine group, 1.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 3.0), was not significantly inferior to the rate in the nevirapine–placebo group (2.8 percent; 95 percent
confidence interval, 1.5 to 4.1). Nevirapine had an effect within subgroups defined by
known risk factors such as viral load and CD4 count. No serious adverse effects were associated with nevirapine therapy.

conclusions

A single dose of nevirapine to the mother, with or without a dose of nevirapine to the infant, added to oral zidovudine prophylaxis starting at 28 weeks’ gestation, is highly effective in reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

other-to-child transmission of
the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) remains a major health problem
worldwide, even though the preventive efficacy of
zidovudine was established in 1994.1-3 In Thailand,
where 1.3 percent of pregnant women are infected
with HIV, since 1993 the Ministry of Public Health
has operated programs for voluntary counseling
and testing of pregnant women and has provided
free infant formula to mothers infected with HIV.4
Since 1999, this national program has provided zidovudine therapy during the last trimester of pregnancy, at delivery, and to the newborn. Even with
these interventions, however, transmission rates remain at or above 6 percent.5,6 When a clinical trial
demonstrated the efficacy of a single dose of nevirapine (Viramune, Boehringer Ingelheim) during
labor plus a single dose to the newborn,7 we hypothesized that, without additional toxicity, logistic complications, or significant cost, perinatal nevirapine therapy added to zidovudine therapy could
further reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV
in Thailand.

methods
trial design

We conducted a multicenter, phase 3, double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The primary
objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of a
single dose of nevirapine administered to women
at the onset of labor and given to infants between
48 and 72 hours after birth, added to zidovudine
prophylaxis, for the prevention of mother-to-child
transmission of HIV type 1. A secondary objective
was to evaluate the incremental effect of the administration of perinatal nevirapine to newborns.
The ethics committees of the Thai Ministry of
Public Health, Chiang Mai University, and the Harvard School of Public Health approved the protocol
used in the study, including the amendments. All
study sites complied with regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services for the protection of human research subjects.
patients

Eligible subjects were pregnant women participating in the national program of voluntary counseling and testing who were receiving zidovudine
prophylaxis (starting at 28 weeks’ gestation or as
soon as possible thereafter) at any of 37 study sites
in Thailand. The subjects were enrolled between

218

medicine

January 15, 2001, and February 28, 2003. Preenrollment evaluations included HIV testing; history
taking and physical examination; ultrasonographic
uterine imaging; measurement of hemoglobin,
white-cell and differential counts; CD4 count; measurements of plasma HIV RNA, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine; and hepatitis B surface
antigen and hepatitis C virus serologic testing.
The subjects were randomly assigned to one of
three study groups at enrollment if they had received
zidovudine for at least 2 weeks, had provided written
informed consent, agreed not to breast-feed, and
had the following laboratory values within 21 days
before randomization: hemoglobin level greater
than 8.0 g per deciliter, absolute neutrophil count
greater than 750 cells per cubic millimeter, alanine
aminotransferase level less than five times the upper
limit of normal (i.e., less than 35 U per liter), and
creatinine level less than 1.5 mg per deciliter (132.6
µmol per liter). Exclusion criteria included a maternal or fetal condition or a concomitant treatment
that contraindicated treatment with zidovudine or
nevirapine, oligohydramnios, unexplained polyhydramnios or in utero anemia, or a medical condition
that required immediate use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Open-label nevirapine was available
to women who did not enroll in the study.
Until delivery, the women in the study had an obstetrical examination every two weeks; every other
week, blood was drawn for hematologic, virologic,
and biochemical testing. Adherence to zidovudine
therapy was assessed at each visit by counting pills.
After delivery, the women were seen at 10 days,
6 weeks, and 4 months for a physical examination
and for hematologic and virologic monitoring. They
were referred to an internist for further follow-up.
Infants were examined at birth, and follow-up
visits were scheduled at 10 days (for measurement
of hematocrit and alanine aminotransferase levels),
6 weeks (for hematologic tests), and 4, 6, 9, and 12
months. At each visit, a supply of powdered formula
was provided to the mother; the child’s health history since the previous visit was recorded, including
the measurement of weight, recumbent length, and
head circumference; and a clinical examination of
the infant was performed. To determine the presence or absence of HIV infection, peripheral blood
obtained at birth, six weeks, and four and six
months was spotted onto filter papers, dried, and
stored at ¡20°C to await shipping to the New England Newborn Screening Program for testing with
a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) DNA assay for

HIV (Amplicor HIV-1 DNA, version 1.5, Roche Molecular Systems).5 Serious adverse events were reported to the ministry of public health and Boehringer Ingelheim.
All the women received 300 mg of zidovudine
twice daily starting at 28 weeks’ gestation or as soon
as possible thereafter; the dosing regimen was
changed to 300 mg every three hours from the onset
of labor until delivery. Infants received 2 mg of zidovudine per kilogram of body weight in an oral suspension every six hours for one week after birth. In
accordance with national guidelines, if the mother
had received zidovudine for a period of less than
four weeks, the infant was treated for four to six
weeks.8
Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections was
provided as necessary, including the administration
of oral trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole to immunocompromised women9 and to infants from six
weeks of age until it was established that they were
not infected.10 After delivery, immunocompromised
women and HIV-infected, immunocompromised
infants were offered antiretroviral treatment that
was provided by the Ministry of Public Health.8
treatment

Women were randomly assigned to one of three
treatment groups. In the nevirapine–nevirapine
group, women received one dose of oral nevirapine
(200 mg) at the onset of labor and neonates received
nevirapine oral suspension (6-mg fixed dose, 0.6 ml)
between 48 and 72 hours after birth. In the placebo–placebo group, women received placebo at the
onset of labor and neonates received placebo between 48 and 72 hours after birth. In the nevirapine–placebo group, women received one dose of
oral nevirapine (200 mg) at the onset of labor and
neonates received placebo between 48 and 72 hours
after birth.
In instances of prolonged and false labor, additional doses were provided to women every 48 hours
until delivery. Infants born less than one hour after
the mother had ingested nevirapine or placebo while
in labor, according to the random assignment of
treatment, were to be given the assigned treatment
within six hours after birth.
randomization and blinding

On enrollment, women were provided with the
study drug, either nevirapine or matched placebo,
to be taken at home at the onset of labor. The study
drugs were identified by random numbers with the

n engl j med 351;3

use of permuted blocks of six in a ratio of 1:1:1.
Twins were assigned to receive the same study drug.
Additional doses were accessible in a blinded fashion at any hospital participating in the study with the
use of a shared code. The study drugs were provided
by Boehringer Ingelheim and were repackaged at
the pharmacy of Children’s Hospital, Boston, in individual blisters or oral syringes (Exacta-Med dispenser, Baxa).
primary end point

Infants were considered to be infected with HIV if
the results of the PCR test were positive in blood obtained on two separate occasions, and infants were
considered to be uninfected if the test results were
negative on two occasions after one month of age.11
Infants who did not meet this definition were evaluated and classified as infected (six infants) or uninfected (three infants) by a clinician and a virologist before unblinding. In twins, infection in one or
both was counted as one transmission.
statistical analysis

The study was designed primarily to test the superiority of the nevirapine–nevirapine regimen over
the placebo–placebo regimen. We calculated that
484 mother–infant pairs were needed in each treatment group for a 0.05 one-sided type I error with
0.8 power, assuming a transmission rate of 8 percent in the placebo–placebo group and 4 percent in
the nevirapine–nevirapine group. The nevirapine–
placebo group was added in order to estimate, as a
secondary objective, the proportion of overall transmission that was prevented by treating infants with
nevirapine. Assuming that 5 percent of the cases
could not be evaluated, the initial target sample size
was 1530.
Interim safety analyses were planned when 40
percent and 70 percent of the total number of women had been enrolled. An increased rate of transmission associated with any of the three treatment
regimens would be considered significant if any
nominal P value was less than 0.0004 at the first interim analysis (with the use of O’Brien–Fleming
boundaries as modified by Lan and DeMets and the
use of one-sided tests with Bonferroni adjustments
for multiple comparisons).12-14
After the first interim analysis, on May 2, 2002,
the independent data and safety monitoring committee recommended stopping enrollment in the
placebo–placebo group. The trial design was modified, and the target sample size was increased to

695 per treatment group to ensure 0.8 power to test
for noninferiority of the nevirapine–placebo regimen as compared with the nevirapine–nevirapine
regimen. Noninferiority would be declared if the upper limit of the 95 percent one-sided confidence interval of the observed difference was lower than 2.5
percent.
Two separate efficacy analyses were performed.
The first efficacy analysis included all three treatment groups and all mothers who delivered before
the first interim analysis. The second tested the noninferiority of the nevirapine–placebo regimen as
compared with the nevirapine–nevirapine regimen.
In addition to an as-randomized analysis, a per-protocol analysis was performed, primarily to test for
noninferiority, in which the populations compared
were defined according to actual intake of the assigned study drug, major deviations from the protocol, and adherence to zidovudine prophylaxis.15
Infants were analyzed according to the actual intake of the maternal or infant study drug. For the
per-protocol analysis, criteria for exclusion were
the intake of placebo by the mother and nevirapine
by the infant, an infant’s receipt of nevirapine more
than 72 hours after birth or more than 6 hours after
birth if the mother delivered less than 1 hour after
receiving nevirapine, undocumented timing of intake by the mother or infant of the study drug, intake by the mother of the study drug more than 96
hours before delivery, less than 50 percent adherence to zidovudine prophylaxis or adherence that
was not documented, breast-feeding, and maternal initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy
during pregnancy.
Characteristics of the mother, the delivery, and
the infant were compared among the treatment
groups with the use of the chi-square and Kruskal–
Wallis tests. The Kaplan–Meier method and Greenwood’s formula were used to estimate transmission
rates and their standard errors. The time to the first
positive HIV test was considered the time to the
end point. Data on infants with negative HIV test
results were censored at the time of their last HIV
test. The method developed by Balasubramanian
and Lagakos, which does not require a predefined
operational definition of HIV infection, was used
for confirmation; the results are not presented, because they were not different from the transmission rates estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method
and Greenwood’s formula.16
The differential effect of nevirapine was tested by
a comparison within subgroups, defined according

220

n engl j med 351;3

medicine

to known risk factors for transmission, of the difference in transmission rates between the placebo–
placebo group and the nevirapine–nevirapine group
(before the first interim analysis) and between the
nevirapine–placebo group and the nevirapine–nevirapine group (at the final analysis). In case of rejection of homogeneity of the effect of nevirapine
across subgroups with the use of a chi-square test,12
the differential effect was also examined within each
subgroup. Except for noninferiority testing, all reported P values are two-sided, without adjustment
for multiple testing. Adverse events in mothers and
infants were analyzed from enrollment until six
months after the birth of the infant.

results
enrollment

Of 3061 pregnant women who underwent testing
for HIV at the study sites and whose results were
positive, 1844 were randomly assigned to study
treatment and 1807 were followed through to delivery. Of those not enrolled, 316 women declined enrollment, 395 moved to another town or were lost to
follow-up, 50 enrolled in a perinatal nevirapine
pharmacokinetics substudy, 104 delivered before
pre-enrollment evaluations, 129 terminated their
pregnancy, 5 had a spontaneous abortion, 3 started
highly active antiretroviral therapy, 2 died before
inclusion, and 213 did not meet the inclusion criteria, including 184 who delivered after less than two
weeks of zidovudine prophylaxis and were offered
open-label nevirapine. Thirty-nine women randomly assigned to the placebo–placebo group were excluded from the analysis because they were provided with open-label nevirapine after the first interim
analysis. There were 12 twin pregnancies and 14
fetal deaths (including 1 twin). Enrollment, loss to

† Nineteen deaths have been recorded, including two of children born to mothers for whom blinding was discontinued after the interim analysis. The causes of death were as follows: in the NVP–NVP group, meconium aspiration and diarrhea
with dehydration; in the NVP–PL group, esophageal atresia, Down’s syndrome with cardiac malformation, multiple malformations (microcephaly, cleft palate, and patent ductus arteriosus), congenital heart malformation, birth asphyxia with
suspected congenital anomaly (in two infants), severe prematurity, diarrhea with dehydration (in three infants); in the

infant safety

In infants, the rates of rash were 15.9 percent and

with no significant difference among treatment
groups. Likewise, increases in alanine aminotransferase levels (36 to 69 IU per liter in 4.8 percent of
infants and 260 IU per liter in one infant; none had
levels above 350 IU per liter) and the presence of
hyperbilirubinemia were not associated with exposure to nevirapine. The rates of serious adverse

PL–PL placebo–placebo. Plus–minus values are ±SE.
† The P value corresponds to the test of homogeneity of the effect of nevirapine across risk-factor categories. P<0.05 indicates that the effect of
nevirapine varies significantly among risk-factor subgroups, that a common estimate of the difference in the rate of transmission in all subgroups should not be used, and that the effect of nevirapine should be tested within each subgroup. P≥0.05 indicates that the effect of nevirapine does not vary significantly among risk-factor subgroups and that a common estimate should be used to test the effect of nevirapine globally.
‡ The P value corresponds to the two-sided test for difference between the PL–PL and NVP–NVP groups, either per stratum (P<0.05 for the test
of homogeneity) or globally through a common estimate of the difference (P≥0.05 for the test of homogeneity).
§ The P value corresponds to the one-sided test of the noninferiority of NVP–PL relative to NVP–NVP, either per subgroup (if P<0.05 for the test
of homogeneity), or globally through a common estimate of the difference (P≥0.05 for the test of homogeneity).

discussion
This study demonstrates the high efficacy of adding a single dose of nevirapine in the mother, with
or without a dose in the infant, to oral zidovudine
prophylaxis for the reduction of perinatal transmission of HIV. The observed reduction by 80 percent that led to the early interruption of enrollment
in the placebo–placebo group was much higher than
we had hypothesized when we designed the study.
The transmission rate observed in the placebo–placebo group was consistent with rates observed in

n engl j med 351;3

other studies in which zidovudine prophylaxis was
initiated at the beginning of the last trimester of
pregnancy,1,19-21 in particular in our previous trial,
which was performed in a similar population.5
Although the efficacy of a single maternal dose
of nevirapine was declared statistically noninferior
to that of a maternal dose plus an infant dose with
the use of our predetermined criteria (2.5 percent
as the upper limit of the one-sided 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between the observed rates of transmission), in fact, two doses appeared consistently better than one throughout our
analysis (Table 4). Moreover, because the nevirapine–placebo group had a somewhat lower median
viral load at baseline than the nevirapine–nevirapine
group, the difference in transmission rates might be
an underestimate. On the basis of these findings

and for additional logistic reasons, the ministry of
public health in Thailand has recommended administration of nevirapine to both mother and infant,
with a slight modification, that of giving nevirapine
to the mother on arrival at the hospital and to the
infant as soon as possible after birth.22
The percentage of infants with a positive HIV test
within three days after birth was significantly lower
in the nevirapine–nevirapine and the nevirapine–
placebo groups than in the placebo–placebo group.
This surprising finding suggests either that infants
become HIV-positive earlier after infection than previously suspected or that perinatal nevirapine may
delay the detection of HIV positivity or even abort
infection completely when transmission occurs in
the last few weeks of pregnancy.
Newborns in this study were formula-fed. This
recommendation, made by the Ministry of Public
Health in 1993, is strongly adhered to and has been
shown to have no negative effect either on the health
of the infant or on the promotion of breast-feeding
among HIV-negative women.5,23,24
In the South African Intrapartum Nevirapine Trial, the rate of intrapartum transmission of HIV was
three times as high when the mother had received
nevirapine less than two hours before delivery as
when the mother had received it earlier.25 Our study
did not confirm this finding. However, since the administration of nevirapine to infants appears to be
safe whatever the delay between birth and receipt of
the drug7,25 and given that in clinical practice women may take their nevirapine dose later during labor
and stay in the hospital for a shorter period, it may
be preferable to administer the dose of nevirapine
to the infant shortly after birth, with the first dose of
zidovudine.
In the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group study
known as PACTG 316, which evaluated the efficacy
of perinatal nevirapine therapy added to standard
antiretroviral therapy, no benefit of nevirapine was
shown.26 The effect of nevirapine was not observed
even in the subgroup of women who received only
zidovudine in addition to nevirapine. This subgroup, however, may have been selected to receive
zidovudine monotherapy because of the subjects’
low viral load. In addition, 43 percent of the women
in the group delivered by planned cesarean section.
We also found that in the subgroup of women whose
viral load at entry was less than 25,000, the transmission rate was very low in the placebo–placebo
group (2 percent) and only marginally lower in the
nevirapine groups. Although a subgroup analysis

226

n engl j med 351;3

of

medicine

has the potential for bias, the effect of perinatal nevirapine was observed in most of the subgroups, a
finding that suggests that there is no population
for whom nevirapine prophylaxis would not be
beneficial.
The discovery of drug-resistance mutations in a
substantial proportion of the recipients of perinatal nevirapine27-34 has raised questions of a possible
risk to mothers who subsequently receive nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors as therapy for
their own disease. The resistance consequences
among the participants of our study are described
by Jourdain et al. elsewhere in this issue of the Journal.35 The maternal risk is juxtaposed with the clear
benefit to the babies. The relative value of this or
other interventions in any particular setting will depend on considerations of cost, medical logistics,
and drug access, as well as on data from future studies of outcomes in women receiving both perinatal
prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy.36 Nevirapine
at delivery added to third-trimester zidovudine results in very low transmission rates with minimal
medical and financial burdens — rates that are very
similar to those achieved with more complex, expensive, and potentially toxic multidrug maternal
regimens.37-43
