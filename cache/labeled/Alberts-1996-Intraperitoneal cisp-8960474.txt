ABSTRACT
Background Intravenous platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard primary therapy for advanced
ovarian cancer. We conducted a phase 3 trial to compare the effects of intraperitoneal and intravenous
cisplatin on the survival of women with previously
untreated, stage III, epithelial ovarian cancer.
Methods The patients underwent an initial exploratory laparotomy and resection of all tumor masses
larger than 2 cm. Within four weeks after surgery, six
courses of intravenous cyclophosphamide (600 mg
per square meter of body-surface area per course)
plus either intraperitoneal cisplatin (100 mg per
square meter) or intravenous cisplatin (100 mg per
square meter) were administered at three-week intervals.
Results Of 654 randomized patients, 546 were eligible for the study. The estimated median survival
was significantly longer in the group receiving intraperitoneal cisplatin (49 months; 95 percent confidence interval, 42 to 56) than in the group receiving
intravenous cisplatin (41 months; 95 percent confidence interval, 34 to 47). The risk of death was lower
in the intraperitoneal group than in the intravenous
group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.96; P ϭ 0.02). Moderate-to-severe tinnitus, clinical hearing loss, and neuromuscular toxic
effects were significantly more frequent in the intravenous group.
Conclusions As compared with intravenous cisplatin, intraperitoneal cisplatin significantly improves
survival and has significantly fewer toxic effects in
patients with stage III ovarian cancer and residual tumor masses of 2 cm or less. (N Engl J Med 1996;335:

O

VARIAN cancer, the leading cause of
death from gynecologic cancer in the
United States, is one of the few solid tumors in which the five-year survival rate
for patients has improved in recent years.1,2 Nevertheless, most women with advanced ovarian cancer
die of the disease. Even those with stage III cancer
and minimal residual intraperitoneal masses (р2 cm
in the greatest dimension) have a median survival of
only about 40 months.3,4
Standard chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer includes a platinum analogue (either cisplatin or
carboplatin). In an attempt to maximize its activity
1950 ؒ

against ovarian cancer, cisplatin has been administered directly into the peritoneal cavity in investigational studies.5 This route yields an intraperitoneal
concentration of cisplatin that is 12 to 15 times
greater than the plasma concentration.6,7 Some phase
2 studies have suggested that survival is prolonged in
patients with small residual masses (Ͻ1 cm) who receive salvage intraperitoneal chemotherapy after initial chemotherapy and second-look surgery.8,9 The
present phase 3 trial compares cisplatin administered
intraperitoneally with cisplatin administered intravenously in patients with previously untreated stage III
ovarian cancer and residual masses no larger than
2 cm in the greatest dimension.
METHODS
Patients
Within four weeks before enrollment, patients underwent an
initial exploratory laparotomy with at least bilateral salpingooophorectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, omentectomy, and
debulking of all tumor nodules to a size of 2 cm or less in the
greatest dimension. The Southwest Oncology Group’s Gynecologic Surgical Review Board reviewed the surgical results to confirm eligibility for enrollment. Only patients with a histologic diagnosis of epithelial-type ovarian cancer were eligible.
Eligible patients had stage III disease, a performance status of
0 to 2 (according to criteria established by the Southwest Oncology Group), normal blood counts, and adequate renal function
(serum creatinine, р1.5 mg per deciliter [130 mmol per liter];
creatinine clearance, у40 ml per minute). All patients gave informed consent according to institutional and federal guidelines
before enrollment.
Treatment Plan
Patients were randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal cisplatin plus intravenous cyclophosphamide or intravenous cisplatin
plus intravenous cyclophosphamide. The randomization procedure incorporated stratification according to the amount of residual tumor (р0.5 cm vs. Ͼ0.5 cm to 2 cm), performance status
(0 or 1 vs. 2), the timing of enrollment (during vs. after surgery),

and the cooperative group (Southwest Oncology Group vs. Gynecologic Oncology Group vs. Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group).
Patients in both treatment groups received cyclophosphamide
(600 mg per square meter of body-surface area in 150 ml of diluent) administered in a 60-to-90-minute intravenous infusion on
day 1. Patients in the intravenous group received cisplatin (100
mg per square meter in 500 to 1000 ml of normal saline) administered intravenously at a rate of 1 mg per minute, followed by at
least 1 liter of normal saline with 3 g of magnesium sulfate and
40 g of mannitol over a period of one to two hours on day 1.
Patients in the intraperitoneal group received cisplatin (100 mg
per square meter in 2 liters of normal saline) warmed to body
temperature and instilled into the peritoneal cavity as rapidly as
possible. Concurrently, these patients received at least 1 liter of
normal saline with 3 g of magnesium sulfate and 40 g of mannitol
intravenously.
Courses of cyclophosphamide and cisplatin were repeated every
three weeks for a total of six cycles, provided the serum creatinine
concentration was less than or equal to 1.9 mg per deciliter (170
mmol per liter), the white-cell count was higher than 3000 per cubic
millimeter, and the platelet count was higher than 100,000 per cubic millimeter. Therapy could be delayed for a maximum of two
weeks to allow for the resolution of toxic effects. Cisplatin was permanently discontinued and the dose of cyclophosphamide increased
to 1 g per square meter (in the absence of grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression) if peripheral neuropathy of grade 2 or higher developed
or the serum creatinine concentration rose above 1.9 mg per deciliter. Therapy was discontinued altogether if the serum creatinine
level remained higher than 1.9 mg per deciliter for eight weeks.
Clinical and Pathological Assessments
At base line and after six courses of therapy, a physical examination was performed, with a complete blood count, serum
CA-125 and blood chemical measurements, and chest radiography. In addition, before each cycle, a physical examination was
performed, with a complete blood count and measurement of serum CA-125 and creatinine concentrations. Blood chemical measurements were performed at the start of every other course. At
the completion of therapy, patients without clinical evidence of
ovarian cancer (excluding an elevated serum CA-125 value) underwent a second-look laparotomy to determine whether there
had been a pathological response.
A complete pathological response was defined as no pathological evidence of disease on second-look surgery and biopsy of the
upper abdomen and the para-aortic and retroperitoneal lymph
nodes, as well as any other site previously involved with tumor.

cm. All previously eligible patients were included in the extended
sample, which was planned to include 560 eligible patients overall
and 390 eligible patients with residual tumors no larger than 0.5
cm. In the analysis of this subgroup, if the hazard ratio was 0.67
for the patients receiving intraperitoneal treatment, the power to
detect a difference was 0.88.
The treatment group, size of residual tumor (microscopical vs.
р0.5 cm vs. Ͼ0.5 cm to 2 cm), age, performance status (0 or 1
vs. 2), race (white vs. other), tumor type (clear cell or mucinous
vs. other), tumor grade, participating group (Southwest Oncology Group vs. Gynecologic Oncology Group vs. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), and timing of enrollment (during vs.
after surgery) were included as covariates in Cox regression analyses.10 Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were used for comparisons of
toxic effects in the two treatment groups. All eligible patients who
received chemotherapy were included in the analysis of toxicity.

RESULTS
Patients

Between June 1986 and July 1992, 654 women
were randomly assigned to a study group: 295 from
the Southwest Oncology Group, 298 from the Gynecologic Oncology Group, and 61 from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. A total of 108 patients were ineligible (52 in the intravenous group
and 56 in the intraperitoneal group) for the following reasons: inadequate surgery (in 54), pathological
findings that did not meet the study criteria (31),
insufficient documentation (20), and miscellaneous

Statistical Analysis
In the original study design (before the protocol was amended
to increase enrollment), it was assumed that 215 eligible patients
would be randomly assigned to each treatment group. At a twosided P value of 0.05, with the use of a Pearson chi-square approximation, the estimated power was 0.85 to detect a difference
of 55 percent versus 40 percent in pathological-response rates in
the intraperitoneal and intravenous groups, respectively. The
power was 0.93 (two-sided log-rank test, a ϭ 0.05) to detect a
difference if the underlying risk of death (hazard ratio) in the intraperitoneal group, as compared with the intravenous group, was
0.67. Survival was defined as the time from randomization to
death from any cause.
Provisions for subgroup analysis were not included in the
original study design. During the study, however, a consensus
emerged among gynecologic oncologists that the patients most
likely to benefit from intraperitoneal chemotherapy were those
with a tumor mass that was no larger than 0.5 cm in the greatest
dimension. Therefore, in January 1991, with no knowledge of
subgroup data, we extended accrual for an additional year to
achieve a sufficiently large sample for a separate analysis of data
from patients with residual tumors that were no larger than 0.5

In both the intravenous and intraperitoneal groups,

other reasons (5 because of complications related to
intraperitoneal catheterization and 3 because of errors by the local pathologist), 2 received treatment

Survival (%)

All eligible patients were included in the primary
analysis regardless of whether they completed the assigned treatment. Covariates associated with improved survival included the absence of gross disease
at enrollment (PϽ0.001), a younger age (PϽ0.001),
a type of tumor other than clear cell or mucinous
(PϽ0.001), and enrollment after surgery (PϽ0.001).
The final Cox model included these four factors and
performance status (which was retained in the model because of its established prognostic importance).
The results after adjustment for these five factors
are shown in Table 3, along with unadjusted median
survival in the two groups. The hazard ratio for the
risk of death in the intraperitoneal group, as compared with the intravenous group, was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.96; Pϭ0.02).
The median survival was 41 months (95 percent
confidence interval, 34 to 47) in the intravenous
group and 49 months (95 percent confidence interval, 42 to 56) in the intraperitoneal group (Fig. 1).
Figure 2 shows the survival curves for all eligible
patients according to the extent of residual intraperitoneal disease. The effect of the treatment (intravenous or intraperitoneal cisplatin) was not influenced
by the extent of residual disease (Pϭ0.93 for the interaction of treatment and residual disease). Table 3
shows the results of a separate analysis for the subgroup of patients with residual tumors no larger
than 0.5 cm. The analysis was repeated for all 654
randomized patients, including those who were ineligible. The results were equivalent to those of the
primary analysis (Table 3).

tients in the intraperitoneal group (3 percent, vs. 0.4
percent in the intravenous group; Pϭ0.002). In the
patients receiving intraperitoneal cisplatin, dyspnea
probably resulted from compression of the base of
the lung by the fluid-filled intraperitoneal cavity.
DISCUSSION

In this study we compared intraperitoneal with intravenous cisplatin in women with advanced ovarian
cancer. All the patients had undergone debulking
surgery and received intravenous cyclophosphamide
concomitantly with the cisplatin. The median survival of the patients treated intraperitoneally was
8 months longer than that of the patients given intravenous cisplatin (49 vs. 41 months), and the haz1954 ؒ

ard ratio in the intraperitoneal group was 0.76
(Pϭ0.02). These results represent a 20 percent improvement in median survival and a 24 percent
reduction in the risk of death during the entire follow-up period among the eligible patients in the intraperitoneal group.
Neutropenia, tinnitus, hearing loss, and neuromuscular toxic effects were significantly less frequent
in the intraperitoneal group than in the intravenous
group. Abdominal pain was more common in the intraperitoneal group, but in most cases it was transient and not severe (i.e., grade 3 or higher in only
5 percent of the patients).
Previous reports have summarized the toxic effects of intraperitoneal cisplatin at doses ranging
from 50 to 100 mg per square meter.11-13 Chronic,
low-grade inflammation from repeated intraperitoneal administration may cause mild-to-severe abdominal pain and intraabdominal adhesions. These
reports have generally focused on patients who had
undergone two exploratory laparotomies before the
administration of intraperitoneal cisplatin. In our
study, all the patients had undergone only one definitive exploratory laparotomy within four weeks
before the start of chemotherapy. Thus, our patients
were probably less susceptible to the local toxic effects of intraperitoneal cisplatin.
Howell et al. reported that after second-line therapy with intraperitoneal cisplatin, rates of surgically established complete responses were significantly
higher among patients with smaller residual intraperitoneal tumor masses (р0.5 cm) than among
those with larger masses (Ͼ0.5 cm to 2 cm).8 Consistent with this finding was the 80 percent rate of a
complete pathological response among our patients
with no gross residual disease who received intraperitoneal cisplatin (32 of 40 patients), as compared
with a rate of 56 percent among those with no gross
residual disease who received intravenous cisplatin
(24 of 43). Such results reflect the fact that the penetration of intraperitoneal cisplatin is limited to a
depth of 0.1 to 1 mm from the surface of the peritoneal tumor.14
We found that intraperitoneal cisplatin was associated with a longer survival than was intravenous
cisplatin, whether residual intraperitoneal tumor masses were 0.5 cm or less or more than 0.5 cm in
the greatest dimension. We do not know the reason
for this result, but several explanations are possible.
All previous investigations of intraperitoneal cisplatin therapy have been phase 2 studies, which included mainly patients who had already received intravenous cisplatin. Our patients had never before
received chemotherapy, and their tumors may therefore have been highly sensitive to cisplatin. Moreover, the precision in measuring intraperitoneal tumor masses during an initial exploratory laparotomy
is limited, and the total volume of the mass may

have more prognostic value than the maximal dimension.
The combination of intravenous paclitaxel plus intraperitoneal cisplatin may prove to be more effective than intravenous cyclophosphamide plus intraperitoneal cisplatin in patients with stage III ovarian
cancer and minimal residual disease. The Gynecologic Oncology Group recently reported that paclitaxel plus cisplatin significantly increased survival
(median, 38 months, vs. 24 months with cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin) when administered as primary chemotherapy in women with incompletely resected stage III or IV ovarian cancer.15 Ongoing
phase 3 studies by the Gynecologic Oncology Group
and the Southwest Oncology Group will further define the role of intraperitoneal cisplatin (and intravenous paclitaxel) in the treatment of stage III ovarian
cancer that has been optimally resected.
