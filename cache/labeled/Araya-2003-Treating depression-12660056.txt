Summary
Background Depression in women is one of the commonest
problems encountered in primary care. We aimed to
compare the effectiveness of a stepped-care programme
with usual care in primary-care management of depression
in low-income women in Santiago, Chile.
Methods In a randomised controlled trial, in three primarycare clinics in Chile, <n>240</n> adult female primary-care patients
with major depression were allocated stepped care or usual
care. Stepped care was a 3-month, multicomponent
intervention led by a non-medical health worker, which
included a psychoeducational group intervention, structured
and systematic follow-up, and drug treatment for patients
with severe depression. Data were analysed on an intentionto-treat basis. The primary outcome measure was the
Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) administered at
baseline and at 3 and 6 months after randomisation.
Findings About 90% of randomised patients completed
outcome assessments. There was a substantial betweengroup difference in all outcome measures in favour of the
stepped-care programme. The adjusted difference in mean
HDRS score between the groups was –8·89 (95% CI –11·15
to –6·76; p<0·0001). At 6-months’ follow-up, 70% (60–79)
of the stepped-care compared with 30% (21–40) of the
usual-care group had recovered (HDRS score <8).
Interpretation Despite few resources and marked
deprivation, women with major depression responded well to
a structured, stepped-care treatment programme, which is
being introduced across Chile. Socially disadvantaged
patients might gain the most from systematic improvements
in treatment of depression.

Introduction
Depression is a major public health problem in rich and
poor countries, and is especially common in women, and
in particular in women who are socially disadvantaged.1–4
In primary care, depression is highly prevalent and
almost twice as common in women as in men.5 Access to
mental-health specialists in developing countries is
inadequate, especially for the poorest sectors of society,
so most depression is treated in primary care. However,
management of depression in primary care is
disorganised and often ineffective in rich and in poor
countries. Depression is often unrecognised, and
initiation and adherence to effective treatment is usually
poor.5–9 Results of clinical trials and comparative studies
have shown the potential effectiveness of drug treatment
or brief structured psychotherapy.10–13 Unfortunately, this
potential is seldom realised. Treatment of depression
often consists of more than one therapeutic component
used as part of a complex sequence of management
decisions with the ultimate goal of overall improvement.
Thus, in sequential, multicomponent programmes
(stepped-care model), patients without severe depression
receive low-intensity treatment, which is followed-up
with intensive management if they do not respond.14
Some components, such as systematic monitoring and
brief psychological interventions, can be effectively
delivered by trained non-medical personnel, reducing
costs and demands on family practitioners.15,16
Primary-care clinics are the main source of care for
almost every poor person in Chile. These clinics are
underfunded and insufficiently resourced, but most have
nurses, social workers, auxiliary nurses, midwives, and
doctors. Primary-care physicians are in short supply and
most have little formal training in primary care. These
doctors typically see six-to-ten patients per hour. Most
clinics have established programmes, usually led by
nurses, for chronic medical conditions, but not for
depression. Most primary-care physicians spend less than
2 years in primary-care posts, whereas nurses and social
workers stay much longer. Specialty mental health care is
available on referral, but waiting times for an initial
consultation typically exceed 2 months.
We designed a multicomponent, stepped-care programme to improve treatment practices for depression
and the efficiency with which resources are used. In
keeping with these goals, the programme was led by a
trained non-medical health worker; a doctor was involved
only if medication was needed for patients with severe
depression. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of this
stepped-care programme with usual care in primary-care
management of depression in low-income women.

Methods
Participants
We enrolled participants in three primary-care clinics in
deprived urban areas of Santiago, Chile, between March,

2000, and November, 2001. The clinics were representative of Santiago primary-care clinics in terms of
resources and of clinical and sociodemographic
characteristics of patients.17 We used a two-stage
screening process to identify female primary-care
patients aged 18–70 years with current major depressive
illness. Consecutive female patients were approached
while they were waiting for consultation. All eligible and
consenting patients were asked to complete the general
health questionnaire (GHQ-12). All women with a score
of 5 or more were asked to return for another GHQ-12
assessment 2 weeks later. Those scoring 5 or more at the
second screening were invited for a baseline assessment
within 1 week. The double screening was part of the
stepped-care strategy to direct resources toward patients
with persistent depression.
Ethics approval was granted by Comite Etica,
Hospital Clinico, University of Chile. Patients gave
written informed consent before being invited to
participate.
Procedures
At baseline, a clinician administered three assessments:
the mini international neuropsychiatric interview
(MINI)18 to ascertain a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis
of major depression, manic or psychotic episode, or
alcohol abuse; the Hamilton depression rating scale
(HDRS);19 and the short form 36 questionnaire (SF-36).
HDRS, the primary outcome measure, has been shown
to give reliable and valid results in primary-care
patients,20 as has the Spanish-language version.21 SF-36
is used to assess functional impairment across a range of
mental and physical domains.22 Four aspects of SF-36
were selected as secondary outcomes: mental health,
emotional role, social functioning, and vitality (selected
because of responsiveness to change in depression). In
primary-care populations similar to ours it has shown
good reliability and sensitivity to change with severity of
depression. A Spanish-language version has been used
successfully in studies of depression in Spanish-speaking
primary-care patients.23
All patients with current DSM-IV major depression
were eligible. Patients with current psychotic symptoms,
serious suicidal risk, history of mania, or current alcohol
abuse were excluded and referred back to their primarycare physician. Patients who had had a psychiatric
consultation or admission to hospital in the 3 months
before the interview were also excluded.
Patients were randomly assigned the stepped-care
improvement programme or usual care. Randomisation
was stratified by clinic and done in blocks of 20 by use of
computer-generated random numbers; individuals who
recruited patients were neither involved in nor aware of
the procedure used to generate allocations. Allocations
were kept in numbered sealed envelopes in each clinic,
and were opened by an individual who had not recruited
patients. The method of randomisation was chosen to
obtain groups of equal size.
The stepped-care improvement programme was a
multicomponent programme consisting of a structured
psychoeducational group, systematic monitoring of
clinical progress, and a structured pharmacotherapy
programme for patients with severe or persistent
depression. Figure 1 shows an overview of the
programme. The psychoeducational intervention group
consisted of seven weekly sessions and two booster
sessions at weeks 9 and 12; each session lasted 75 min.
Each group included about 20 participants. Topics

Figure 1: The stepped-care intervention programme

covered included information on symptoms and causes
of depression, available treatment options, scheduling
positive activities, problem-solving techniques, and basic
cognitive and relapse-prevention techniques. Patients
were given a manual with detailed information of the
contents of each session accompanied by examples and
exercises. Group leaders were social workers and nurses
who received 12 h of training and 8 h of supervision
from the principal investigators. Most group leaders
were employed in local primary-care clinics. Patients
were discouraged from contacting the group leader
outside the sessions unless essential.
Patients with severe depression (HDRS score >19) at
baseline or persistent depression (HDRS score >12)
after 6 weeks of group treatment were referred back to
their primary-care physician for a structured
pharmacotherapy programme.24 Primary-care physicians
received 4 h of training to enable them to deliver a brief
pharmacotherapy protocol that included structured
assessment at initial and follow-up visits and the use of a
standard medication algorithm to ensure adequate dose
and duration of treatment (fluoxetine, amitriptyline, or
imipramine). Group leaders monitored medication
adherence and attendance at follow-up visits for patients
receiving pharmacotherapy (figure 1).
Patients assigned usual care received all services
normally available in the primary-care clinic, including
antidepressant medication or referral for specialty
treatment. Before the initiation of the study, primarycare physicians in the control group received guidelines
on how to treat depression in primary care. No
services normally available were restricted or withheld,
and primary-care physicians received no information
from study workers about patients in the usual-care
group.
All participants were invited to attend the primarycare clinics for outcome assessments at 3 and 6 months
after randomisation. Follow-up interviews were done by
an independent clinician blinded to treatment
assignment. Patients attending outcome assessments
received a small payment to cover travel expenses.

Statistical analysis
On the basis of data from other primary-care studies, we
anticipated that follow-up HDRS scores would have an
SD of about 7 points. Thus, a sample size of 120 patients
per group would have 80% power for detection of a
difference of 2·5 points in mean HDRS score between
groups with two-sided significance of 5%.
Data were analysed in accordance with CONSORT
guidelines; between-group comparisons were by
intention-to-treat. We obtained descriptive statistics for
the primary outcome measure (HDRS score) as a
continuous and categorical (proportion of patients
improved [defined as a 50% score reduction] and
recovered [score <8]) variable. Primary comparison
between groups was by repeated measures analysis of
covariance25 with adjustment for baseline and clinic in a
random effects model. Interaction between time and
group were assessed (for changes in group effects with
time) and, in the absence of such an interaction, the
overall difference between groups across the two followup assessments was calculated (95% CIs and p values).
To investigate the effect of loss to follow-up on the
intention-to-treat analysis, we did a sensitivity analysis
using the last-observation-carried-forward approach.
Secondary analyses included adjustment for baseline
characteristics. Secondary outcomes were analysed with

Results
Figure 2 shows the trial profile. 3560 consecutive female
patients completed initial screening. 1731 (49%) scored
at least 5 in the GHQ-12. 1635 (94%) returned for the
second GHQ-12, but only 722 (44%) were still above the
threshold. All patients received an appointment for a
baseline assessment within 48 h, but only 375 were
interviewed before a sufficient number of women had
been recruited. Recruited and non-recruited patients had
similar GHQ-12 scores. Of those interviewed, 240 (64%)
were eligible and agreed to be randomised (figure 2).
Among patients excluded, most were women who did not
meet DSM-IV criteria for major depression. For practical

reasons the number of patients recruited varied: 40, 80,
and 120 were recruited in each clinic, respectively. The
number not completing blinded outcome assessments
were similar in the stepped-care and usual-care groups at
3 months (18 vs 11, respectively) and 6 months (16 vs
13, respectively).
Mean age of participants was 42·6 years (SD 13·6),
128 (53%) were married, and 200 (83%) were
housewives. A previous depressive episode was reported
by 136 (57%), five women had a previous psychiatric
admission, and 62 (26%) had been diagnosed with a
chronic medical illness. Mean GHQ-12 and HDRS
scores were 10·0 (2·2) and 19·7 (3·7), respectively.
Groups were similar with respect to demographic and
baseline clinical characteristics (table 1). These
characteristics were also similar across clinics—for
example, mean HDRS scores at baseline in the three
clinics were 19·5 (3·6), 19·3 (4·2), and 20·0 (3·7),
respectively.
104 (87%) women in the stepped-care group attended
at least one group session: ten attended one-to-two
sessions; five attended three-to-four; 11, five-to-six; 34,
seven-to-eight; and 44 attended nine sessions. Mean
number of sessions attended was 6·26 (3·28). Nonattendance at group sessions was not always
accompanied by loss to follow-up; of 16 women who
never attended a group session, six underwent both
outcome assessments and seven had at least one
assessment. In the stepped-care group, 95 (79%) women
were on antidepressant medication at some time during
the study, compared with 41 (34%) in the usual-care
group.
Mean HDRS score of the stepped-care group was
about 10 points lower than that of the usual-care group at
3 and 6 months, with either missing values replaced by
the last observation carried forward or exclusion of
missing values and use of observed data only (figure 3).
With observed data, in a repeated measures analysis of
covariance adjusting for baseline HDRS score and clinic,
there was no significant interaction between time and
treatment allocation (–0·12; 95% CI –2·52 to 2·76;
p=0·93), but the main effect of treatment allocation
across both follow-up points was large and significant, in
favour of the intervention (table 2). We repeated the

analysis after adjusting for the large differences in the
proportions prescribed antidepressants in the two groups.
The estimate, 95% CIs, and p value for HDRS score was
not much changed by either this adjustment or by
controlling for the small baseline imbalance in chronic
medical conditions. Likewise, a sensitivity analysis had
almost no effect on the results, which was as expected on
the basis of the data presented in figure 3. To aid
interpretation of the primary analyses in table 2,
descriptive statistics for the binary versions of HDRS
scores are presented in table 3. For example, the
proportion of women who recovered (HDRS <8) by
6-months’ follow-up was 73 (70%) of 104 in the steppedcare group compared with 32 (30%) of 107 in the usualcare group (table 3).
We did similar analyses for secondary outcome
measures (tables 2 and 4); between-group differences
were large and significant in favour of the stepped-care
group (table 2). Adjustment for antidepressants and
baseline imbalance in chronic medical conditions did not
alter the results for any of the SF-36 sub-scales that we
analysed.

Discussion
Our results show a large and significant difference in
favour of the stepped-care programme compared with
usual care, consistent across all assessed outcomes, and
stable during 6 months of follow-up. Rates of participation
in the intervention programme were high, and
participation in blinded outcome assessments exceeded
85% in both groups. The programme widened the role and
responsibilities of non-medical workers and increased the
participation of patients in their own treatment. These
features are all important to modern service development
in developing and developed countries.
For obvious reasons, participants could not be blinded
to treatment, and we cannot rule out the possibility that

the clinicians who did outcome assessments learned of
treatment allocation. However, we obtained similar
results using a self-reported measure, the SF-36 mental
health dimension. It is therefore unlikely that an
assessment bias had much effect on our results.
Patients in the stepped-care programme received
several treatment components (patients’ education,
behavioural activation, problem-solving techniques,
systematic
and
structured
follow-up,
and/or
pharmacotherapy). We did not aim to establish the
effectiveness of isolated components of treatment, but
rather to assess a programme that included components
shown to be effective, available locally, and that could be
used in an efficient stepped-care programme. In other
words, our programme was intended to be as close as
possible to what should be an adequate, efficient, and
more importantly, feasible treatment programme in our
particular setting. Even though there were large
differences in the proportion of people in each group who
were prescribed antidepressants, we think it is unlikely
this could account for the significant differences in
outcomes between the groups since adjusting our results
for medication did not alter our main findings.
We did not design the programme to introduce radical
changes to established practices. We aimed to improve
existing care with structured protocols and rationalise the
use of available resources. Often, innovative programmes
are introduced that involve changes impossible to
assimilate in the day-to-day delivery of care. The main
innovative element was role enhancement for the nonmedical group leaders, most of whom were available in
the clinics and were often closely connected to local
neighbourhoods. These workers were given the time and
training to deliver the group psychological intervention
effectively, monitor treatment progress, and act as
advocates or care managers. They also acted as brokers
between patients and doctors without interfering with
doctors’ work. On the contrary, doctors appreciated the
help and information. We decided to concentrate our
intervention in a high-risk group, poor women, so that
the psychoeducational group intervention could focus on
topics relevant for that group. This strategy seems to have
worked because attendance rates and overall satisfaction
with the programme were reasonably good.
Our results have some limitations. First, research has
shown that benefits gained early during treatment tend to
decline after 1 year or longer.11,26,27 Unfortunately, we
were unable to do a 1-year assessment, but our 6-month
results compare favourably with those of other
programmes.11–13,26 Second, the usual-care group did
worse than in other studies from developed countries, an
unsurprising finding in view of the deficiencies in primary
health care and the characteristics of patients in the
Chilean sample. Third, our intervention was designed for
ease of implementation in other primary-care settings,
but we cannot be certain that our results are generally
applicable. Finally, our psychological intervention
included nine group sessions, which could be thought
unrealistically intense in some settings. However,
psychological interventions of similar intensity had
already been tried with success in primary-care settings in
Chile and the costs were acceptable to services and
patients. Our main aim was to show that organised,
improved treatment, as a first step, could effectively make
a difference in a setting of socioeconomic disadvantage.
Future interventions should test the effectiveness of lessintensive and costly psychological interventions.
Clinics and patients were representative of primary
care in Santiago, Chile,5,17 with high rates of morbidity,

severe resource limitations, and socioeconomically
deprived populations. These factors are common barriers
to effective care in most public-sector clinics in
developing countries. Thus, we think our results could be
applicable in similar settings to ours, but also that similar
strategies can be equally cost effective to manage
depression or other chronic illnesses in more advantaged
or organised practice settings. Contrary to some
expectations, developed countries can learn much from
developing countries in how best to rationalise resources
when working with deprived populations under tight
budgetary conditions.
The combination of high rates of depressive illness,
poverty, and scarce resources can easily induce nihilism
in physicians and policy-makers. Our findings should
offer hope that modest interventions can have a
substantial effect on depressive symptoms and functional
impairment. The benefits of our programme exceed those
seen with similar interventions in settings with lessdeprived patients and more treatment resources. Unlike
results from many other successful treatment studies, our
results were well received by local policy-makers who
have now launched a national pilot programme for the
treatment of depression in primary care based on this
intervention. Socially disadvantaged patients, especially
in the developing world, might have the most to gain
from modest investments in organised treatment of
depression.

Clinical picture
Wernicke’s encephalopathy
Markus Ploner, Alfons Schnitzler
A 36-year-old man was admitted to the emergency ward
in a global confusional state. Apart from the patient’s
name and age no further information on the history
was obtainable. Neurological examination revealed
intermittent upbeat nystagmus, convergent strabismus,
horizontal gaze palsy, and a severe ataxia of stance and
gait. Laboratory findings showed an elevation of
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, serum amylase and
serum lipase, and a macrocytic anaemia. Drug and
alcohol testing was negative. Based on the classical
triad of clinical features—ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and
confusion—Wernicke’s encephalopathy was diagnosed
and thiamine was administered immediately. A fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic
resonance-scan showed hyperintense signals around
the third ventricle, in the fornix, and around the fourth
ventricle, the hypothalamus, and the mamillary bodies
(figure): findings characteristic of Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid showed a small elevation of
protein content. Within the first days ocular palsies nearly
completely recovered while ataxia and confusion
remained unchanged. A history of chronic alcohol abuse
was confirmed.
