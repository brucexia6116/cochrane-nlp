ABSTRACT
Objective False positive diagnosis of preterm labor
is common. As a consequence, medications including
corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity and
tocolysis are prescribed unnecessarily. We tested the
hypothesis that management of threatened preterm
labor based on measurement of cervical length by
ultrasonography can reduce the number of women who
receive inappropriate treatment.
Methods <n>Forty-one</n> women with threatened preterm
labor for whom a clinical decision was made to prescribe
antenatal corticosteroids and tocolysis were randomized
to have their cervical length measured by transvaginal
ultrasound (n = 21) or to receive therapy as planned
(n = 20). Fourteen women in the ultrasound group had a
cervix longer than 15 mm and the therapy was withheld,
while the other seven with a short cervix were managed
in the same way as the control group.
Results Three women (14%) in the ultrasound group
were treated inappropriately with antenatal corticosteroids because they remained undelivered for more
than a week. This compared favorably with the control
group where 18 out of 20 (90%) received corticosteroids
unnecessarily (relative risk (RR) 0.16; 95% conﬁdence
interval (CI), 0.05–0.39). Tocolysis was given to only
seven women (33.3%) in the ultrasound group compared
with 20 (100%) in the control group (RR 0.3; 95% CI,
0.15–0.54). There were no babies in either group who
were born prematurely without being given a full course
of antenatal corticosteroid therapy.
Conclusion Women with threatened preterm labor and
cervical length more than 15 mm should not receive
tocolysis. The issue of the safety of withholding

corticosteroid therapy in this clinical scenario warrants
further study. Copyright  2007 ISUOG. Published by

INTRODUCTION
The diagnosis of preterm labor is notoriously difﬁcult.
Meta-analysis of clinical trials of antibiotics in women
with threatened preterm labor reported that only 18%
of women in the ‘no intervention’ group actually
delivered within 7 days of the diagnosis1 , while a large
multicenter study of tocolytic therapy reported that,
in the placebo arm, 49% of women in preterm labor
still remained undelivered after 7 days2 . Such a high
rate of false positive diagnosis of preterm labor results
in a large proportion of women being given antenatal
corticosteroids and tocolysis unnecessarily. Antenatal
corticosteroids (two injections 12 hours apart) not only
promote fetal lung maturity and reduce the incidence of
respiratory distress syndrome, but also reduce neonatal
mortality and neonatal intracranial hemorrhage3 . It is,
therefore, understandable that clinicians try to avoid a
situation where a preterm baby is born without exposure
to corticosteroids.
When a presumed diagnosis of preterm labor has
been made, tocolysis is commenced to delay labor for
a minimum of 24–48 h, thus allowing time for the
administration of a full course of corticosteroids. However, tocolytics, especially betamimetics, have unpleasant
side-effects4 , while several episodes of threatened preterm
labor in the same pregnancy may expose the fetus to multiple courses of corticosteroids with potentially serious
long-term consequences5 .
We conducted an observational study in which cervical
length was measured by transvaginal ultrasonography in

216 singleton pregnancies presenting with painful uterine
contractions before 36 weeks’ gestation. We found that
99% of women with a cervical length of ≥ 15 mm did not
deliver within 7 days, regardless of the use of tocolytics6 .
Based on these ﬁndings we conducted a randomized
controlled trial to evaluate the hypothesis that in women
presenting with threatened preterm labor the decision to
administer tocolytics and steroids should be based on the
sonographic measurement of cervical length.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
This multicenter randomized trial was conducted between
2003 and 2005 in ﬁve hospitals in the UK and one
in Spain following approval by the local Research
Ethics Committees. Women were eligible if they fulﬁlled
the following criteria: (1) live, singleton pregnancy;
(2) uterine contractions before 34 completed weeks’
gestation; and (3) a clinical decision was made to use
tocolytics and steroids. We excluded women with preterm
premature rupture of membranes, or if a course of
antenatal corticosteroids or oral steroid therapy had
been given within 7 days of possible randomization. All
the women had a vaginal examination on admission,
however, a change in the Bishop score was not a
prerequisite for randomization. None of the hospitals
used ﬁbronectin to conﬁrm or refute the diagnosis of
preterm labor.
A member of the research team assessed eligibility for
the study after obtaining the appropriate information
from the clinicians caring for the women. Following
counseling by the members of the research team, eligible
women who agreed to sign the written informed consent
were randomized using consecutively numbered sealed
envelopes kept in a secure drawer on the respective labor
wards. The original computer-generated randomization
sequence was kept separately.
Women randomized to routine care received tocolytics
and antenatal corticosteroids as per the hospital’s protocol
and clinician’s instructions. Women allocated to the
experimental group had a transvaginal scan to measure
the cervical length, which was performed by a member of
the research team who was not involved in the care of the
patient. If the cervical length was less than 15 mm women
were given tocolytics and antenatal corticosteroids as per
the hospital’s protocol. Women with a cervical length of
15 mm or more were managed expectantly; tocolysis and
antenatal steroids were not prescribed. Women with a
cervical length of ≥ 15 mm in whom uterine contractions
persisted had another transvaginal scan 4 h later, or earlier
if clinically indicated, and the same protocol was followed.
The primary outcome of interest was the proportion
of women still pregnant 7 days (168 h) after the last
injection of antenatal steroids. Other outcomes of interest
were appropriate treatment with corticosteroids (preterm
birth with corticosteroids given within 1 week of delivery),
duration of tocolysis and hospitalization, gestational age
at delivery and incidence of preterm labor.

Statistical considerations
Data were analyzed according to intention to treat principles using parametric tests for normally distributed
continuous variables and relative risks (95% conﬁdence
intervals for comparison of proportions). Our observational data6 indicated that, in the control group, at least
90% of eligible women would still be pregnant 7 days
after the administration of antenatal corticosteroid therapy. We hypothesized that ultrasound-aided management
of preterm labor would reduce by 50% the number of
women still pregnant 1 week after corticosteroid treatment. In order to prove this hypothesis we needed to
recruit 40 women (power 80%, alpha of 5%).

RESULTS
Communication between labor ward clinicians and the
research team proved difﬁcult owing to the workload and
we were, as a result, unable to collect data on the number
of women with threatened preterm labor who fulﬁlled
the inclusion criteria but were not offered participation
in the study. In total, the research team was informed
of 43 potentially eligible women. One woman declined
participation and one woman was deemed ineligible
because of vaginal bleeding. Demographic and clinical
data were available for all 41 eligible women who agreed
to participate (Figure 1).
As expected, the groups were balanced in respect of the
demographic and clinical ﬁndings (Table 1). Twenty-one
women were randomized to have a transvaginal scan;
seven of them (33%) had a short cervix. One woman
with a cervix < 15 mm also had a dilated cervix on
vaginal examination (2 cm); the cervical os was thought

to be closed in the others. All women with a cervix longer
than 15 mm had a closed cervix on vaginal examination,
apart from one woman in whom the cervix admitted a
ﬁngertip. In the control group 18 women had a closed
cervix, in one woman the cervix admitted a ﬁngertip, and
in one the cervix was 1–2 cm dilated.
Management of the threatened preterm labor in both
groups is summarized in Tables 2 and 3. In the ultrasound
group, all fourteen women in whom the standard therapy
was withdrawn because of a long cervix delivered more
than 7 days after randomization (range 35–88 days).
The remaining seven women with a short cervix were
prescribed corticosteroids and tocolysis; three (42.9%)
remained undelivered 7 days later. All women in the control group were prescribed a combination of steroids and
tocolysis as per protocol; 18 of them remained undelivered
7 days later. There was, therefore, a signiﬁcant difference
in the proportion of women exposed to tocolytic therapy i.e. 33.3% in the ultrasound group vs. 100% in the
controls (relative risk (RR) 0.3; 95% conﬁdence interval
(CI), 0.15–0.54). The difference between the two groups
in the proportion of women who received inappropriate
treatment, deﬁned as giving birth more than 7 days after
the administration of antenatal corticosteroids or preterm
birth without corticosteroid treatment, was highly signiﬁcant (RR 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05–0.39; P < 0.0001).
Therefore 18 women in the ultrasound group received the
appropriate treatment, deﬁned as preterm birth with antenatal corticosteroids given ≤ 7 days previously (n = 4) or
birth > 7 days after randomization without being given
antenatal corticosteroids (n = 14), compared with only
two women in the control group (Table 2).

Six women were prescribed antibiotics after randomization. In the scan group three women had antibiotics for a
urinary tract infection (UTI) and one for prelabor rupture
of membranes; two women were prescribed antibiotics
for a UTI in the control group.
Fifteen women in the ultrasound group were discharged
within 48 h, ﬁve within 24 h. Two out of 14 women with
a cervical length > 15 mm needed a further transvaginal
scan because of persistent uterine contractions, but in
both cases the cervix remained long. Both women were
discharged within 48 h and gave birth at term. In the
control group, six women stayed in hospital for ≤ 24 h,
six women for 24–48 h and eight for more than 2 days.
The difference in the duration of hospital antenatal stay
between the two groups was highly statistically signiﬁcant
(P < 0.0001).
Three premature babies in the control group and one
in the scan group experienced breathing difﬁculties; there
were no other neonatal morbidity or deaths recorded in
either group.

DISCUSSION
Our study shows conclusively that cervical length
measurement by transvaginal ultrasonography in women
with threatened preterm labor reduces unnecessary
exposure of pregnant women and their babies to
corticosteroid and tocolytic therapy. The clinical beneﬁts
include reduction in the risk of maternal side-effects and
minimization of the risk of repeated fetal exposure to
corticosteroids if episodes of threatened preterm labor
persist. Although we have not performed formal health
economic analysis, the savings from the reduced use of
tocolytic therapy and shortened antenatal hospital stay
are likely to be substantial.
The high proportion of women who remain undelivered
7 days after the diagnosis of preterm labor (85%) and the
preterm delivery rate before 34 weeks’ gestation of only
12% indicate a relatively low-risk population despite
the clinical diagnosis of preterm labor and decision to
prescribe therapy. Unfortunately, it was not possible to
collect the demographic and clinical data on potentially
eligible women who did not take part in the study, but
there was no indication that women at a particularly
high risk of preterm birth were systematically denied the

centers involved.
Is there a possibility that the widespread use of
transvaginal ultrasonography to conﬁrm or refute the
diagnosis of preterm labor may cause harm? Our study
was not large enough to exclude the possibility that
withholding antenatal corticosteroid therapy if the cervix
is long (> 15 mm) may result in some preterm babies being
born without adequate corticosteroid treatment. Our
observational data show that the risk of this happening
is unlikely to be greater than 2–3%6 . However, large
cohorts would have to be followed up after ultrasoundbased management until 35 weeks’ gestation to see how
many women may miss getting corticosteroid prophylaxis
before preterm birth. A combination of a long cervix and
low levels of ﬁbronectin is likely to reduce the risk of
imminent preterm birth even further7 .
A non-inferiority trial to conﬁrm that the targeted
management of preterm labor based on transvaginal
ultrasound with or without ﬁbronectin is as safe as
current management based on the combination of digital
vaginal examination and clinical assessment would have
to include in excess of 4000 women with threatened
preterm labor. As such a large study is unlikely to be
undertaken in the foreseeable future we believe that the
implementation of our protocol, including repeated 2–4
hourly transvaginal scans when clinical suspicion persists,
coupled with a careful review of all cases when a baby is
born without exposure to antenatal corticosteroids is the
best way forward.
