Treatment of symptomatic oral lichen planus remains a
challenging problem. This study compared the efficacy
of topical tacrolimus ointment with triamcinolone acetonide ointment in patients with oral lichen planus. Twenty
patients (group I) were treated with topical tacrolimus
0.1% ointment 4 times daily, and 20 (group II) were
treated with triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment 4
times daily. The clinical effect was graded after 6 weeks.
In group I, 6 patients healed, 12 showed improvement
and 2 showed no improvement. In group II, 2 patients
healed, 7 improved and 11 showed no improvement. The
most commonly reported side-effect in both groups was
temporary burning or stinging at the site of application.
Unfortunately, oral lesions recurred within 3–9 weeks of
cessation of treatment in 13 of the 18 patients who had
initially shown an improvement or were healed in group
I and in 7 of the 9 patients in group II. Topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment induced a better initial therapeutic
response than triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment.
However, relapses occurred frequently within 3–9 weeks
of the cessation of treatment. Key words: side-effects; treatment.

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a common benign inflammatory disease affecting mainly middle-aged and elderly
people, with a prevalence of approximately 0.5–2%. The
disease has a female:male ratio of approximately 2:1 and
may persist for many years (1). The diagnosis of OLP is
based on a combination of characteristic clinical findings,
history and histopathological examination. The hyperkeratotic (white) variant of OLP is often symptomless. The
atrophic or the erythematous (red) variant and the erosive
or the ulcerative (yellow) variants of OLP generally have
persistent symptoms (1–5).
Treatment of symptomatic OLP is challenging. Several drugs have been used with varying efficacy (1,
3). Specific treatment includes corticosteroids (topical,

DOI: 10.2340/00015555-0070

intralesional or systemic), retinoids, cyclosporine,
psoralen plus ultraviolet A light (PUVA), griseofulvin,
hydroxychloroquine and dapsone (1, 3).
Recently, topical tacrolimus was reported to be effective in the treatment of patients with OLP in a number
of pilot studies (2–6). However, these studies lacked
adequate control groups, and relapses of symptomatic
OLP were also reported to occur frequently, generally
within weeks of the cessation of topical tacrolimus
treat­ment (2–6).The aim of this prospective randomized
study was to compare the efficacy of topical tacrolimus
0.1% ointment with that of triamcinolone acetonide
0.1% ointment in patients with symptomatic OLP. The
side-effects of the treatment in each group and the periods of remission after the cessation of therapy were
also compared.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A prospective randomized study was conducted between 2001
and 2004 in 40 Caucasian patients (30 women, 10 men; age
range 32–82 years; mean 58 years) with a confirmed diagnosis
of symptomatic OLP based on clinical and histopathological features at the department of Dermatology of the Albert
Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands. Exclusion
criteria were: age younger than 18 years; histopathological
examination with atypical or lichenoid dysplastic features;
asymptomatic oral lesions and specific treatment within 4 weeks
prior to the study. The extent and the severity of OLP and the
prior treatment schedules in the 40 recruited patients were
comparable and showed no statistically significant difference
(p > 0.99). All patients were treated for 6 weeks. Treatment was
discontinued earlier when patients showed a complete healing.
The follow-up period was for at least 3 months. Treatments
were randomly allocated to patients in order of inclusion according to a predetermined randomization-list stratified by sex.
The patients were divided into two groups. Each patient was
provided with detailed verbal and written information on the
study protocol. Each patient provided written informed consent
to participate in the study. Ethical approval was obtained prior
to commencing the study.
In group I, 20 patients were treated with topical tacrolimus
0.1% ointment (Protopic® 0.1%, Astellas Pharma Inc., The
Netherlands), which was applied 4 times a day onto the symptomatic oral lesions. In group II, 20 patients were treated with
triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% in hypromellose 20% ointment,
which was also applied 4 times a day. The reasons for this administration schedule in both groups were to achieve a comparable
level of patient compliance and to achieve effective numbers
of application of the ointments because topical agents do not
easily adhere to the moist mucous membranes.

Statistical analysis of the results was performed by means of the
exact χ2 trend test and the Fisher’s exact test with a statistical
significance set at p < 0.05.

(Fisher’s exact test: p = 0.16). The most frequent
side-effect was transient irritation including burning
or stinging at the site of application lasting for about
10–30 min. It occurred primarily in patients with the
erosive or ulcerative form of OLP in both groups, but it
did not lead to discontinuation of the treatment in any
patient. Moreover, the local irritation after treatment
was significantly reduced, when the lesions became
less erosive or ulcerative. Unfortunately, oral lesions
recurred within 3–9 weeks (mean 5 weeks) after the
cessation of the treatment in 13 (72%) of the 18 patients
in group I and in 7 (78%) of the 9 patients in group II,
who initially showed improvement or healing.

RESULTS

DISCUSSION

The patients’ characteristics and results are shown
in Table I. One patient in group I had vulvovaginalgingival syndrome. The two groups were similar for
characteristics such as sex, age, symptoms and the duration of the disease, histopathology, the predominant
form of OLP and the involved anatomical site. The
initial results of the treatment in group I were better
than in group II (exact χ2 trend test: p = 0.007). Sideeffects were temporary and more common in group
I, but the difference was not statistically significant

Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive macrolide drug
produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis and used to
prevent transplant rejection (2, 7). In vitro, tacrolimus
exerts an activity that is 10–100 times higher than
that of cyclosporine (2). Topical tacrolimus (FK 506,
Protopic® 0.1% or 0.03% ointment) was approved as a
safe treatment for atopic dermatitis (4). Tacrolimus is a
smaller molecule and penetrates better into the skin and
the mucosa than cyclosporine (2, 3). Generally, no systemic blood levels of tacrolimus were detected in most
patients with OLP (2, 4). However, systemic absorption
of tacrolimus may occur with low, but measurable,
blood levels through absorption via the oral mucosa
or ingestion (6, 8). A contributing therapeutic systemic
effect cannot be excluded with certainty in such cases
(8). Side-effects such as burning sensation at the site
of application, transient taste disturbance, intermittent
headaches, and rarely patchy hyperpigmentation of
the oral mucosa as a result of topical tacrolimus treatment in OLP were reported (2, 4, 5, 8, 9). Although its
exact mechanism of action in OLP remains unknown,
topical tacrolimus was shown to inhibit T-lymphocyte
activation by inhibiting the phosphatase activity of
calcineurin. Without calcineurin to dephosphorylate the
nuclear factor of activated T cells, gene transcription
for lymphokines, IL-2, and interferon-γ is inhibited
leading to a decrease in the number of lymphocytes
(3, 7). Recently, topical tacrolimus was also reported
to be a safe and effective treatment in vulvar lichen
planus (7).
The results of this study allow the conclusion that
treatment with topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment four
times daily induced a better initial therapeutic response
than triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment in patients
with symptomatic OLP. However, relapses occurred
frequently in both groups within several weeks after
the cessation of both the treatments. Transient irritation
at the site of application was more common in patients
treated with topical tacrolimus, but did not lead to
discontinuation of the treatment. It is noteworthy that

The clinical effect of treatment in the patients was graded
after 6 weeks by the treating physician using an ordinal score
and recorded as worse, unchanged, improved or healed. The
ordinal (ranked) scoring involved assessing the severity and the
extent of the disease. An improvement of less than 30% in the
extent and the severity of the lesion was scored as unchanged.
An improvement of more than 30% in the extent and the severity
of the lesions was scored as improved and as healed when the
lesion had resolved completely. No blood samples were taken
for determining the levels of tacrolimus and cortisol.

Oral lichen planus treatment

in this study, tacrolimus was applied 4 times daily, because topical agents adhere poorly to the moist mucous
membranes (10).
Prolonged or intermittent use of topical tacrolimus
ointment in patients with symptomatic OLP may be
useful, but remains to be clearly established in large,
well-designed clinical studies. Nonetheless, at present,
topical tacrolimus may be a valuable addition to the
already existing therapeutic modalities for treating
patients with OLP.
There was no conflict of interest.
