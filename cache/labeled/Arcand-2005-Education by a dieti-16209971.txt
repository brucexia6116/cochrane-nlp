Background Multidisciplinary heart failure (HF) programs reduce hospital readmission and improve clinical
outcomes. Although dietitians are often members of such teams, no randomized studies have demonstrated the independent
benefit of dietitian-administered dietary counseling for patients with HF. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of
dietitian education on adherence to a sodium-restricted diet in ambulatory patients with stable HF.
Methods Patients with HF (left ventricular ejection fraction b35%) were randomized into a dietitian education group
(n = 23) or a usual care group (n = 24), then observed for 3 months. Both groups received a 2 g/d dietary sodium
prescription. The usual care group received nutrition advice by way of self-help literature, whereas the dietitian education
group returned for 2 counseling sessions with a dietitian.
Results

Dietitian education resulted in a significant decrease in sodium intake at 3 months (2.80 F 0.30 to 2.14 F
0.23 g/d, P b .05). In contrast, there was no change in sodium intake in the usual care group (3.00 F 0.31 to 2.74 F
0.35 g/d, P = ns).

Conclusions Dietitian-administered counseling was more effective than providing literature in reducing dietary sodium
intake in patients with stable HF. (Am Heart J 2005;150:716.e1- 716.e5.)
Nonadherence with medical and nutritional therapies is
a major and potentially reversible cause of adverse events
for patients living with heart failure (HF).1-3 The multidisciplinary HF clinic has become the cornerstone for the
management of this syndrome in large part to improve
patient adherence and to reduce hospital readmission
rates.4-12 Dietary modification is a standard therapy in
most HF programs, with the primary nutritional prescription being sodium restriction. Various methods of
implementing a sodium-restricted diet have been
used with nurse-delivered dietary education being most
common. Participation of a dietitian in the education of
patients with HF has been well described7-9,13; however,
only a few trials have used dietitians to deliver nutrition
education.7-9,13,14 Dietitian involvement is often limited

to patients with nutritionally complex problems such as
morbid obesity, diabetes, or severe volume overload.
Dietitian counseling may lead to improved adherence to a
sodium-restricted diet, and possibly to overall nutritional
status. This latter possibility is important based on the
recent recognition of malnutrition in this setting.15
Despite the potential benefits of dietitian involvement
in the management of HF, whether counseling administered by a dietitian is more effective in reducing sodium
intake than usual care has not been tested in a controlled
trial. This is relevant because usual care for patients
observed in HF clinics typically already includes educational materials and general nutritional counseling by
nurses and/or physicians. Demonstration of the added
benefit of dietitian-delivered counseling would also
provide justification for the cost of widespread specialized nutritional counseling as a component of a multidisciplinary clinic. Therefore, the purpose of this study
was to compare 2 strategies to prescribe a sodiumrestricted diet to patients with stable diuretic-requiring
HF: counseling by a registered dietitian versus standard
delivery of written educational materials to patients.

tertiary care, academic center. Patients were eligible to
participate if they had stable HF with a left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) b35%, were taking at least 20 mg furosemide
daily, had stable symptoms without hospitalization or change
in diuretic dose in the past 3 months, and were able to read
and comprehend a nutrition education package. Patients
were excluded if their primary residence was an institution
where meal and food selections were not by choice, if they
had received nutrition counseling from a dietitian in the past
6 months, had diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, significant
renal dysfunction (creatinine N 185 mmol/L), or were unable to
give informed consent.

Randomization and study design
Patients were randomized into 1 of 2 groups: dietitian
education or usual care (control). Both groups were prescribed a
2 g/d sodium-restricted diet and were provided with standardized nutrition education materials. Only patients in the dietitian
education group received 2 individualized nutrition-counseling
appointments with a registered dietitian. Study end points were
collected 3 months after randomization. The study protocol was
approved by the Research Ethics Board at Mount Sinai Hospital
and all patients provided written informed consent.

Nutrition education materials
The nutrition education package, which was given to all
patients, included 2 components: a 2 g/d sodium-restricted diet
handout and a low-sodium shopper’s guide. These materials
were developed by a group of dietitians and were reviewed by a
communications specialist to maximize readability. The lowsodium handout was developed specifically for patients with HF
and outlined the rationale of salt restriction. It included general
information on sodium/salt, discussed high-/low-sodium foods,
and provided low-sodium recipes. The handout also gave
instruction on label reading, tips for eating in restaurants, and
seasoning foods without adding salt. The low-sodium shopper’s
guide was a booklet that reviewed sodium content in commonly
purchased foods. It also listed low-sodium versions of foods and
provided a list of local venues that carry these products.

Nutrition education provided to the dietitian
education group
The nutrition education protocol was developed by dietitians
at Mount Sinai Hospital. Nutrition counseling focused on the
2 g/d sodium-restricted diet prescription. The initial session
occurred 1 week after recruitment and after completion of
baseline food diaries. At this time, patients received the
nutrition education materials (see above). The dietitian completed a nutrition assessment to determine dietary patterns and
trends in sodium intake. Patients were educated on the
concepts and strategies for a sodium-restricted diet and
individualized nutrition care plans and goals were developed.
The first session lasted 45 minutes. Follow-up counseling
occurred 4 to 6 weeks after the initial visit with the dietitian. At
this visit, previous teaching and nutrition goals were reviewed.
This visit lasted 30 minutes.

Usual care provided to the control group
On the day of randomization the HF clinic nurse completed a
routine assessment, which in our group includes a review of
fluid intake and avoidance of high-sodium foods. Patients were
told that the educational package contained information and
guidelines regarding sodium intake and were asked to open
and read the contents at home, after completion of the baseline
food diaries. Study personnel informed patients in the usual
care group that the educational package described a 2-g
sodium-restricted diet. No further counseling was offered
before collecting study end points at 3 months.

Study end points
The primary study end point was change in dietary sodium.
Secondary nutritional end points included fluid, energy,
carbohydrate, protein, and fat intakes. Secondary clinical end
points included weight, diuretic dose, and blood pressure. A
3 day food record was used to measure intake and evaluate
dietary adherence. This is a common tool used in clinical trials
to assess dietary intake and 3 days is sufficient to capture
individual day-to-day variation.16 Patients were instructed how
to complete a food record including estimation of portion sizes,

recorded 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day in their diaries. Both
study groups received the same instructions for the recording
of food diaries. All food records were analyzed using ESHA
Food Processor Version 7.4 (Salem, Ore).

Statistical analysis
Baseline comparisons were performed with t tests and m2.
Within- and between-group comparisons of the impact of
dietitian counseling were preformed using a 2-way repeatedmeasures analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls
post hoc comparison. All data are expressed as mean F SE. All
statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat version 1.0
(Systat Software Inc., Richmond, Calif). A P value of b.05 was
accepted as significant.

Results
Baseline characteristics
The dietitian education group (mean age 56 F 3 years,
18 men) had a mean LVEF of 22% F 2%. This group
included 12 patients with coronary disease and 11
patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. The mean
furosemide dosage in this group was 82 F 13 mg/d. The
usual care group (mean age 61 F 3 years, 17 men) had a
mean LVEF of 23% F 2%. Nine patients in this group had
coronary disease, and the mean furosemide dosage was
90 F 12 mg/d. There were no differences between the
groups at baseline in terms of clinical characteristics or
dietary profiles (see Table I). The mean daily sodium
intakes were V3 g in both groups (see Table I).
Although 50 patients were recruited, 3 patients were
excluded from the final analysis: 2 for not completing
food records and 1 patient developed hypothyroidism
and resigned from the study. Therefore, the final analysis
included 23 patients in the dietitian education group and

Responses to dietitian education versus usual care
Patients in the dietitian education group had a
significant reduction in dietary sodium at 3 months
( P b .05), a response that was also significant when
dietary sodium was adjusted for total energy intake
( P b .05) (Table I and Figure 1). This reduction in daily
sodium intake occurred without any changes in total
fluid intake or the macronutrient content of patients’
diets (Table I). As fluid and overall nutritional intake
did not change, there was also no change in weight in
this group. There was a trend for reduced blood
pressure in the intervention group at 3 months that
did not achieve statistical significance.
In the usual care group there were no significant
changes in dietary sodium intake alone or when adjusted
for energy (Table I and Figure 1). There were also no
changes in any other nutritional end points. No patient
in either group required any adjustment in furosemide
or other medical therapy during the course of this study.

Discussion
The central finding of this investigation was that
nutrition counseling administered by a registered dietitian resulted in a reduction in dietary sodium intake in
patients with stable HF. In contrast, simply providing
literature on a sodium-restricted diet was ineffective in
reducing sodium intake in this population. This is the
first controlled and randomized demonstration of the
effectiveness of dietitian-administered counseling, independent of other interventions that occur in the setting
of multidisciplinary HF management.
The effectiveness of dietary education provided by a
dietitian, as compared with simply providing educational materials, is not surprising based on the complexities associated with adherence to a low-sodium
diet. A recent survey of patients with HF highlighted
some of the challenges posed by a low-sodium diet.17
These included lack of knowledge of low-sodium foods,
difficulty with adherence to sodium restriction when
eating in restaurants or social events, and limited food
choices compatible with a low-sodium diet. Furthermore, low-sodium foods tend to be more expensive and
less accessible. The expertise of a dietitian allows for
detailed nutrition education to deal with these issues.
Therefore, the success of our intervention was likely
attributed to the dietitians’ ability to teach skills and
strategies for incorporating a sodium-restricted diet into
a patient’s lifestyle.
Although not the focus of this study, patients with HF
often have comorbidities that can also be addressed with

nutritional therapy. These include renal dysfunction,
diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and morbid obesity.
Furthermore, because a reduction in dietary sodium
intake necessitates a change in food patterns, secondary
alterations in macronutrient and micronutrient intakes
may result.18,19 This is especially relevant because patients with HF may not be meeting their nutritional
requirements.20 Therefore, dietitian-administered counseling may also assist patients to achieve optimal nutritional health while complying with a low-sodium diet.
Sodium restriction is the primary nutritional therapy for
the management of HF. A sodium diet of 2 to 3 g/d is
recommended based on consensus reports21,22; however, no clinical trials have evaluated this guideline.
Therefore, the long-term benefits of sodium restriction on
clinical end points such as diuretic requirements and
repeat hospitalizations remain to be established. Mechanistic studies in patients with HF have confirmed that
sodium restriction reduces extracellular volume,23 and
that patients with HF have impaired sodium homeostasis
which is amenable to sodium restriction.24 However,
Alvelos et al25 recently demonstrated increases in plasma
norepinephrine and aldosterone in euvolemic patients
with HF in response to a 2.3 g/d sodium diet, raising
debate as to the most appropriate sodium prescription in
this population. Despite the uncertainty regarding which
patients should restrict sodium and to what extent
sodium should be reduced, we elected to aim for a 2 g/d
sodium diet in this study based on current recommendations.21,22 Furthermore, we limited inclusion to diureticrequiring patients given that reduced sodium intake
would likely be most clinically relevant to this group.
In this study we used a 3-day food record to measure
sodium intake. Urinary sodium provides an accurate
reflection of sodium intake26; however, based on high
day-to-day variability in dietary sodium it has been
estimated that three to fourteen 24-hour collections
would be needed to estimate true daily intake with b10%
variation.27,28 Food records likely have similar limitations
but have the advantage of being easily administered.
Food record assessment of sodium intake has been
validated against urinary sodium excretion in healthy
individuals and in patients with hypertension.26,29 The
validity of these methods in the setting of HF is untested.
Given the variability of sodium content in food, patients
were required to record whether food items were
commercially or home prepared and to indicate specific
brands of foods consumed and names of restaurants
attended. This comprehensive approach and the use of
validated specialized nutritional analysis software optimized the assessment of dietary sodium and nutritional
intake.30 In the present study, although only one group
received dietary counseling, both groups received
similar instructions from a dietitian regarding the
completion of multiple day food records.

Limitations of the present study should be considered.
This was a small study that was performed in a single
center; therefore, its generalizability cannot be assumed.
However, this study included a control group, recruited
patients similar to other HF studies, and performed an
intervention that was not extraordinary. In this study,
there were no changes to hemodynamic, anthropometric, and laboratory end points. Based on the small sample
size, the relatively short study period, and the stability of
the patients recruited for this study, changes in these
parameters were unlikely. Because patients were
assessed at 3 months, it is unknown if these results can
be sustained over longer periods. In some patients,
ongoing counseling may be required. We also did not
determine whether the control group actually read the
self-help literature provided to them. However, this is
reflective of real-life experience.
These results provide evidence for the role of a
dietitian as part of the HF multidisciplinary team in
helping patients achieve and adhere with a sodiumrestricted diet. Although the cost-effectiveness of a
dietitian is unknown in this population, improved
adherence to nutritional prescriptions in this study
provides evidence for the role of dietitians in the
management of patients with HF.
