ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Literature indicates a relationship between selenium supplementation and risk of diabetes.
However, because these data are inconclusive, we investigated the effect of selenium supplementation on
serum glucose levels in men with prostate cancer enrolled in a clinical trial testing of the effect of selenium
on prostate cancer progression.
METHODS: Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n ϭ 46), selenium 200 ␮g/day (n ϭ 47), and
selenium 800 ␮g/day (n ϭ 47). Serum glucose levels were obtained every 6 months for up to 5 years.
Longitudinal analysis was carried out to assess whether rate of change of serum glucose levels was
signiﬁcantly different in the selenium-supplemented groups as compared with placebo. Sensitivity analyses
were performed to assess the robustness of ﬁndings.
RESULTS: Changes in serum glucose levels during the course of the trial were not statistically signiﬁcantly
different as compared with placebo for the selenium 200 ␮g/day (P ϭ .56) or selenium 800 ␮g/day
(P ϭ .91) treatment groups.
CONCLUSION: These results do not support a relationship between selenium supplementation and changes
in serum glucose levels. Recommendations about selenium supplementation and risk of diabetes will
require more deﬁnitive studies.

Although selenium supplementation has been reported to be
inversely associated with prostate cancer risk,1-3 recent reports indicate that it may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.
In secondary analyses of data from the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer (NPC) study, 58 subjects in the seleniumsupplemented group (n ϭ 600) and 39 subjects in the placebo group (n ϭ 602) developed type 2 diabetes (hazard

The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial
(SELECT) is a phase-3 randomized clinical trial conducted
to assess whether supplementation with 200 ␮g/day selenium or 400 IU/day vitamin E would prevent prostate cancer in average-risk men.6 Interim review indicated that selenium did not prevent prostate cancer in this population.6 A
statistically nonsigniﬁcant increased risk of type 2 diabetes
was observed in the selenium group (P ϭ .16) but not in the
selenium ϩ vitamin E group.6
Each study has its limitations. In secondary analysis of
the NPC study, diabetes was not the primary outcome, and it
was self reported.4 In the SELECT analysis, not only was
the diabetes status self reported, but the relative risk was not
statistically signiﬁcant.6 In the analysis by Bleys et al,5

Effect of Selenium on Serum Glucose Levels

Figure Mean serum selenium levels (upper panel) and glucose levels (lower panel) at each quarterly clinic visit for

DISCUSSION
Serum glucose levels in subjects supplemented with 200 or
800 ␮g/day of selenium were not statistically signiﬁcantly
different than those observed in subjects on placebo. These
results do not support previous conclusions about association between selenium and diabetes in other studies.4-6 The
current analysis does provide distinct advantages over previous studies. Because serum glucose values were used as
an outcome in this study, there was reduction in bias associated with self-report, and misclassiﬁcation associated with
diagnosis of diabetes, both of which were limitations for
SELECT and secondary analysis of the NPC study. Measuring serum glucose every 6 months provided more accurate characterization of the change in glucose levels over
time and a more powerful estimate than could be obtained

767
using measurement at a single time point. Based on adherence (Figure), bias due to differential rates of compliance
was not a confounding factor. The longitudinal study design
also addressed the issue of temporality of the association
between selenium and serum glucose levels, which was a
limitation in the earlier cross-sectional study by Bleys and
colleagues.5
In the NPC trial, the odds ratio for the association between diabetes and selenium supplementation was strongest
in the highest tertile of baseline selenium (hazard ratio ϭ 2.70; 95% CI, 1.30-5.61).4 In our study, mean baseline
serum selenium levels were statistically signiﬁcantly higher
for the total population as well as for each of the tertiles as
compared with the NPC study (P Ͻ.001 for the total population and each tertile).1 If the hypothesis that selenium
supplementation leads to an increase in serum glucose levels held true, the likelihood of seeing this effect would be
higher in a population with higher baseline selenium supplemented with a higher dose of selenium (800 ␮g/day in
the Watchful Waiting Trial). Current data do not reﬂect this.
Although a sample size of 140 is relatively small, repeated measures for serum glucose (n ϭ 853) increase the
statistical power as compared with studies having only one
time point. It would have been ideal if the blood for measuring glucose was collected after all the subjects had fasted
for at least 8 hours, but this was not part of the Institutional
Review Board-approved protocol when the parent study
was instituted. Models were statistically adjusted to take this
into account, as also has been done by Bleyer et al.8 Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of
ﬁndings.10 Results from these analyses demonstrated comparable results for analysis conducted for the total population, and the analysis restricted to subjects with only fasting
data.
These results indicate that the putative diabetes risk associated with selenium supplementation may be unfounded.
Deﬁnitive studies need to be performed before recommendations can be made.
