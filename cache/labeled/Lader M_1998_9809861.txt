A multicentre double-blind comparison of hydroxyzine, buspirone
and placebo in patients with generalized anxiety disorder

Received : 26 January 1998 / Final version : 15 May 1998

Abstract The e¦cacy of hydroxyzine and buspirone,
controlled by placebo, was investigated in a doubleblind, parallel group, multicentre study conducted in
France and the UK. A total of <n>244</n> patients with
generalised anxiety disorder in primary care was
allocated randomly to treatments with hydroxyzine
(12.5 mg morning and mid-day, 25 mg evening), buspirone (5 mg morning and mid-day, 10 mg evening) or
placebo (three capsules / day) for 4 weeks, preceded by
a 1-week single-blind placebo run-in and followed by
1-week single-blind placebo administration. Rating
scales were applied on days -7, 0, 7, 14, 12, 28 and 35.
Seventy percent of the patients were female; the average age was 41 ± 11 years, and the mean Hamilton
Anxiety Score at day 0 was 26.5 ± 4.2. Only 31 of the
<n>244</n> patients dropped out, but equally in the three
groups. Intention-to-treat LOCF analyses on the primary variable showed a signiÞcant di¤erence only
between hydroxyzine and placebo with respect to
improvement on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (10.75
versus 7.23 points, respectively). Secondary variables
such as CGI and self-ratings (HAD scale) showed both
hydroxyzine and buspirone to be more e¦cacious than
placebo. Thus, hydroxyzine is a useful treatment for
GAD.

Introduction
Hydroxyzine acts as an antagonist at H1 receptors and
to a lesser extent at muscarinic receptors and 5-HT2
receptors and with even less binding to alpha1 and
dopamine2 receptors (Kubo et al. 1987; Snyder and
Snowman 1987). It has anxiety-allaying properties in
doses of 50 mg / day and was introduced to the French
market as long ago as 1955. It is licenced throughout
most countries in the world to treat patients with anxiety, often in conjuction with bodily symptoms such as
pruritus (Cambazard and Chambefort 1987), dyspepsia and irritable bowel (Grimaldi 1987) and brochospasm (Ramon 1987). Over its many years of usage,
there have been no documented reports of dependency,
abuse, or memory disturbances. The commonest
unwanted e¤ect is sedation, which is clinically expressed
by somnolence, but this usually wanes with continuing
treatment.
In the treatment of anxiety, the benzodiazepines have
been extensively used, often on a long-term basis.
Concern has been mounting in many countries with
regard to such wide usage as the adverse e¤ects of these
drugs have emerged (Hallström 1993). Normal dose
dependence, abuse potential, neuropsychiatric reactions and e¤ects on memory have led to calls to restrict
the use of the benzodiazepines (British Committee on
Safety of Medicines 1988). In many countries, prescriptions of benzodiazepines have fallen markedly and
a switch has been made to using non-benzodiazepines
without these disadvantages. Among the newer compounds are buspirone, a 5-HT1A partial agonist
(Gelenberg 1994) and its congeners.
Hydroxyzine has a favourable risk / beneÞt and its
role in the management of patients with GAD has been
re-examined. In a recent study of 110 GAD patients,
hydroxyzine (50 mg / day for 4 weeks) was signiÞcantly
better than placebo in ameliorating anxiety (Darcis
et al. 1995). No rebound and no withdrawal syndrome
were detected following discontinuation of the drug;

403

somnolence, although reported in 28 % of patients on
hydroxyzine versus 14 % of those on placebo (NS), led
to drop-out in only one.
In this publication, we report a large-scale doubleblind, randomised study comparing hydroxyzine with
placebo and buspirone in the treatment of patients with
GAD according to DSM-IV criteria. Many of the
instruments used were the same as those in the previous study, thus facilitating comparison.

Materials and methods
The study was multi-centre (62 centres, 48 in France, 14 in the UK);
the patients were seen by primary care doctors with a particular interest in psychiatric disorders under the coordination of hospital psychiatrists. The participating doctors were trained in the use of the
various rating instruments. The study was approved by the appropriate ethics committees and all participants gave informed consent.
This study was carried out following the GCP-ICH guidelines.
Patient selection
Out patients of either sex aged between 18 and 65 years presenting
with GAD according to DSM-IV criteria were eligible for inclusion, providing their initial Hamilton Anxiety Rating Score was 20
or more. Depressive disorders according to DSM-IV criteria were
excluded, but low levels of depressive symptoms did not exclude
patients who met GAD criteria. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or inadequate contraceptive precautions, major depressive
disorder or alcohol abuse, organic or psychotic disorders, undergoing long-term psychotherapy, or intake of psychotropic medication during the previous 4 weeks.
Patients gave a urine sample and were placed single-blind on
placebo for 1 week (day -7 to day 0). On day, 0 they were reassessed
and placebo responders (more than 7-point improvement on the
Hamilton) or anyone proving positive for urinary benzodiazepines
were excluded.
Power calculations showed that 180 evaluable patients were
needed to allow the detection with a 90 % probability of a drugplacebo di¤erence of 5 points on the Hamilton scale. To allow for
20 % withdrawals, a target of at least 228 patients was aimed at.
Drugs and dosages
Patients were allocated randomly to receive over 4 weeks (days
028) Þxed doses of: hydroxyzine 50 mg / day (12.5 morning, 12.5
mid-day, 25 evening), buspirone 20 mg / day (5, 5, 10) or placebo
three capsules (1, 1, 1).
The dose of hydroxyzine is that usually used to treat anxiety
(Darcis et al. 1995). That for buspirone is in the mid-range of the
recommended dosage schedule. Compliance was estimated by a capsule count every visit. There were no di¤erences between the groups
with respect to compliance. No concomitant psychotropic medication was allowed; beta-blockers and clonidine were also excluded.
Following the active treatment phase, patients were placed on
placebo single-blind for 7 days (days 2835) to investigate possible
discontinuation e¤ects.
Clinical assessments
The investigator carried out the following assessments :
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (Hamilton 1959) (main outcome
variable);

Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (Montgomery
and Åsberg 1979);
Clinical Global Impression (Ecdeu 1976);
Ferreri Anxiety Rating Diagram (Ferreri et al. 1988) (France
only).
These ratings were carried out on days 0, 7, 28 and 35. The
patients rated themselves on :
Echelle Dyscontrole Comportemental (EDC) (Hantouche et al.
1992) (France only);
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmund and Snaith 1983);
Tyrer Withdrawal Symptom Scale (Tyrer et al. 1990).
The Þrst two were carried out weekly, the last on days 28 and
35. Urinary benzodiazepine screening was performed on days -7,
28 and 35.
Clinical examinations were carried out weekly (except days 14
and 21).
Adverse events were recorded whether or not attributed to the
medication.

Statistical analysis
This followed standard procedures with analysis of intent-to-treat
population with last observation carried forward (LOCF) to deal
with premature discontinuations. All tests were two-tailed and the
0.05 probability was accepted as the signiÞcance level. Analysis of
variance was used for parametric data, Kruskal-Wallis for nonparametric quantitative data, and chi-square for qualitative data.
The double-blind was not broken until after data analysis was completed.
The primary outcome variable was pre-set as change in Ham-A
from day 0 to day 28.

Results
Patient characteristics
Patients were recruited from November, 1995 until
April 1996 by 62 general practitioners organised into
six groups, each coordinated by a psychiatrist. A total
of 266 patients was recruited, of whom 20 failed to
meet inclusion criteria after the placebo run-in (day
-7 to day 0). Thus, 246 patients meeting DSM-IV GAD
criteria were allocated randomly to hydroxyzine, buspirone or placebo (82 in each group). However, two
patients (one hydroxyzine; one placebo) dropped out
before taking any medication.
Demographic and baseline data are presented in
Table 1. There were no statistically signiÞcant
di¤erences between the groups for any of the variables.
E¦cacy
The primary outcome variable is shown in
Fig. 1. Null hypothesis of equal e¦cacy between
treatments was rejected (P = 0.015); from pairwise
comparisons
(Buspirone-Placebo,
HydroxyzinePlacebo, Hydroxyzine-Buspirone), only the di¤erence
in improvement between placebo and hydroxyzine was

statistically signiÞcant (Fig. 2). The somatic and psychic subscales showed similar patterns. Because hydroxyzine might have shown e¦cacy predominantly because
of sedative e¤ects on sleep, the data were re-analysed
omitting the sleep item : the patterns of signiÞcance were
unchanged. Another way of judging e¦cacy is to count
the number of patients whose total HAM-A score
halved with treatment. These were 42% with hydroxyzine, 36% for buspirone, and 29 % for placebo (NS).
The Clinical Global Severity Scale showed an
improvement over the 28 days of treatment of 1.53
points in the hydroxyzine patients, 1.27 in the buspirone
patients and 0.95 in the placebo-treated patients (P <
0.02; hydroxyzine signiÞcantly di¤erent from placebo)
(Table 2). On the Clinical Global Improvement Scale,
signiÞcantly (P < 0.005) more patients were improved
on hydroxyzine (50 %) than on placebo (30 %).
With respect to the MADRS Scale, both hydroxyzine
and buspirone patients were signiÞcantly better than
placebo (P < 0.001) (Table 2). Similarly, in the self-rating of depression (HAD-Dep scale), both active drugs
were signiÞcantly superior to placebo (P < 0.01);

di¤erences were also found on the anxiety scale (P <
0.001) (Table 2).
The EDC scores continued this latter pattern with
both hydroxyzine and buspirone e¤ecting greater
improvements than placebo. This was repeated for the
FARD total score (Table 2).
E¤ects of symptomatic depression
Only one-quarter of the patients were judged to have
pure GAD, the rest su¤ering an admixture of symptomatic depression, as is typical in general practice.
This is shown by the appreciable initial MADRS scores
(Table 1). The mixed group were signiÞcantly more anxious and impulsive than the uncomplicated group but
there were no other baseline di¤erences. Some di¤erential drug e¤ects were detected : hydroxyzine tended to
be just as e¤ective in the pure as in the mixed group,
whereas buspirone appeared more e¤ective than
placebo only in the mixed group (trend only).
E¤ects of discontinuation
As Fig. 1 shows, there was no rebound with respect to
HAM-scores following placebo substitution at day 28.

Indeed, both the hydroxyzine and the buspirone
patients continue to improve. Similar patterns were seen
with the other e¦cacy variables. No signiÞcant withdrawal symptoms for either active drug were detected
on the Tyrer Scale.
Adverse events
Of the 244 patients given medication, 10 / 81 hydroxyzine, 10 / 82 buspirone and 11 / 81 placebo dropped out
prematurely, a total of only 31 (12.7 %). The commonest reason (six, seven, six respectively) was protocol violation, the second (two, two, two) lack of e¦cacy.
No serious ADRs were recorded.
In the three groups, 32 / 81 hydroxyzine-treated
patients (39.5 %) reported one or more side e¤ects, as
compared with 31 / 82 buspirone (38 %) and 23 / 81
placebo (28 %) patients. The only side e¤ects a¤ecting
more than 5 % of the exposed patients were somnolence in the hydroxyzine group (9.9 %) as compared
with 4.9 % in the buspirone and none in the placebo
group; headache and migraine (6.1 %) in the buspirone
group (4.9 % and 1.2 % in hydroxyzine and placebo
groups); dizziness (6.1 %) in buspirone-treated patients
(cf. 0 in hydroxyzine and 2.5 % in placebo patients). No
changes in cardiovascular measures (pulse, BP) or in
weight were detected. The somnolence associated with
hydroxyzine was transient and had largely disappeared
by day 10 except for one patient.
Thus, both active treatments were very well tolerated.

Discussion
This study was designed to conÞrm the results of an
earlier study (Darcis et al. 1995) that hydroxyzine was
an e¤ective drug in the treatment of patients with the
carefully deÞned primary diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder. The main di¤erence between the two studies was the incorporation of an active comparator,
buspirone, in the present study. The study followed the
usual format with placebo control, random allocation
to treatment, double-blind procedures, and moreover,
the following points are worthy of note.

The patients studied were fairly typical of those participating in GAD trials (e.g. Power et al. 1990; Ansseau
et al. 1991), with a 2:1 ratio of females/males and a
mean age in the early 40s. The condition was generally
a chronic or relapsing one with about Þve previous
episodes, during which a wide range of treatments had
been used. The typical patient had anxiety of moderate
secerity. The groups were well matched (see Table 1).
Recruitment for the study was rapid, few responded
to initial placebo, the running of the study was uneventful and the drop-out rate was gratifyingly low (less than
15 %). This reßects the interest and experience of the
investigators, and careful training by the psychiatrists
of their groups of general practitioners. Many of these
GPs had a particular interest in psychiatric problems.
In view of the consistently positive results for hydroxyzine, less so for buspirone, it must be assumed that
the rating procedures were both reliable and valid.
The primary e¦cacy variable, the Hamilton Anxiety
Score showed di¤erences between hydroxyzine and
placebo but not between buspirone and placebo.
However, hydroxyzine was not signiÞcantly di¤erent
from buspirone. The e¦cacy of hydroxyzine was not
due to sedative actions on sleep. Some sub-analyses
suggested that buspirone showed better e¦cacy in
patients with an admixture of depression than in those
with pure anxiety. By contrast, hydroxyzine was
equally e¤ective in both groups. The secondary variables mostly showed both hydroxyzine and buspirone
to be superior to placebo (Table 2). Some apparent
e¦cacy was seen on measures of depressive symptoms.
However, these results should be interpreted with caution, as these rating scales have not been validated in
patients other than those su¤ering from primary
depressive disorders. Thus, hydroxyzine is conÞrmed as
having e¦cacy in GAD, across a fairly wide spectrum
of assessment instruments, both investigator- and selfrated. In terms of numbers improved (CGI rating),
about half of those treated showed major improvement
as compared with 30 % on placebo.
Comparison with the Darcis et al. (1995) study shows
that e¦cacy was a little less in the present study. For
example, di¤erence in number of responders on the
HAM-A on hydroxyzine (41 %) versus placebo (18 %)
was signiÞcant (P < 0.01) in the earlier study but not
in the present one (42 % versus 29 %).

Despite the known sedative e¤ects of centrally acting
antihistaminic compounds, adverse e¤ects were not a
major problem with hydroxyzine. Somnolence was
reported in about 10% of patients, but this was a Þxed
dose study and dosage adjustment would be expected
to lessen this Þgure. A study is currently in progress to
evaluate the e¤ects of hydroxyzine on psychological performance. The side-e¤ect proÞle with buspirone was as
expected with headache and dizziness at fairly low rates.
One of the main reasons for re-evaluating the
risk / beneÞts of hydroxyzine in GAD is the concern
over the dependence potential of the benzodiazepines
(Hallström 1993). Although 4 weeks is a relatively short
term for the induction of dependence, no discontinuation phenomena were noted with hydroxyzine (or with
buspirone). There are no reports in the literature of any
such problems with hydroxyzine, even in longer-term
use (Shalowitz 1961), and it is highly probable that this
drug has a low or absent dependence potential
(Barrance and Bridger 1977). A study is ongoing to
address this question. The present study conÞrms previous open-label and controlled studies (Garber 1958;
Breslow 1968; Lipton 1961; Goldberg and Finnerty
1974). It also very closely replicates the data in the
Ferreri et al. (1995) study with respect to baseline characteristics of the patients studied, improvements
attained and signiÞcance levels achieved. Like them, we
conclude that hydroxyzine o¤ers the possibility of
e¤ective relief of generalised anxiety and is a useful
and safer alternative to the benzodiazepines.
