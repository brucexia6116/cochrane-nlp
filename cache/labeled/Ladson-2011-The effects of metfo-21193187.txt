Objective: To determine if the combination of lifestyle (caloric restriction and exercise) and metformin (MET)
would be superior to lifestyle and placebo (PBO) in improving the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) phenotype.
Design: Double-blind randomized 6-month trial of MET versus PBO.
Setting: Two academic medical centers.
Patient(s): <n>One hundred fourteen</n> subjects with PCOS were randomized to MET (N ¼ 55) or PBO (N ¼ 59).
Intervention(s): Subjects collected urine daily for ovulation monitoring, had monthly monitoring of hormones and
weight and determination of body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, glucose tolerance, and were
evaluated for quality of life at baseline and completion.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Ovulation rates and testosterone levels.
Result(s): Dropout rates were high. There was no signiﬁcant difference in ovulation rates. Testosterone levels were
signiﬁcantly lower compared with baseline in the MET group at 3 mos but not at 6 mos. There were no differences
in weight loss between groups, but MET showed a signiﬁcant decline at 6 months compared with baseline (À3.4 kg,
95% conﬁdence interval À5.3 to À1.5 kg). We noted divergent effects of MET versus PBO on oral glucose tolerance test indices of insulin sensitivity (increased) and secretion (worsened). Total bone mineral density increased
signiﬁcantly in MET. There were no differences in quality of life measures between the groups. The MET group had
increased diarrhea and headache, but fewer bladder infections and musculoskeletal complaints.
Conclusion(s): The addition of metformin to lifestyle therapy produced little reproductive or glycemic beneﬁt in
women with PCOS, although our study had limited power owing to a high dropout rate. It is not possible at baseline
to identify women likely to drop out. (Fertil SterilÒ 2011;95:1059–66. Ó2011 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

There are multiple treatment options for obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Although PCOS is diagnosed primarily
on reproductive abnormalities, i.e., chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, it is associated with metabolic
disturbances, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, that are exacerbated by obesity
(1). Therapies used for the treatment and prevention of type 2

diabetes, including diabetic medications and lifestyle changes, are
also used in PCOS (2, 3). Diabetes prevention trials are often
conducted in populations that overlap with obese PCOS women,
and their results are often extrapolated to treatment of PCOS.
Large-scale trials are now testing the beneﬁt of combination therapy
for diabetes prevention (4). The combination of lifestyle and metformin therapies has had additive beneﬁts at preventing weight gain in
other populations (5).
Lifestyle modiﬁcation in obese women with PCOS has become,
at least based on expert opinion, the cornerstone of therapy for
PCOS (6, 7). The results of similar combination lifestyle/
metformin trials, although on a smaller scale, have shown more
modest results in PCOS, often with minimal or mixed effects on
the reproductive abnormalities of chronic anovulation and
hyperandrogenism (8–10). We hypothesized that the combination
of lifestyle and metformin therapies would be superior to lifestyle
alone in improving ovulatory frequency, hyperandrogenism, and
insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
The Institutional Review Boards of the Meharry Medical College and Penn
Sate College of Medicine approved the study. Subjects were randomized

between 2004 and 2007 and each of them gave written informed consent. We
used the 1990 National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development PCOS diagnostic criteria to identify subjects (11):
chronic anovulation, deﬁned as spontaneous intermenstrual periods of R45
days or a total of %8 menses per year, and hyperandrogenism deﬁned as an
elevated total testosterone (>50 ng/dL) or a free androgen index [ratio of testosterone/SHBG (100)] >1.5 (12). Other causes of anovulation and hyperandrogenism were excluded by appropriate tests. Subjects were aged 21–39
years, in good general health and currently off confounding medications
(e.g., hormonal contraceptives, diabetic medications, etc.).

and closed comedones (noninﬂammatory lesions) were obtained from the forehead, left and right cheeks, nose, and chin by trained study personnel (15).

Power Analysis and Randomization

Serum reproductive hormones (baseline, 3 months, and end of
study) LH, FSH, DHEAS, and SHBG were determined by chemilumines-

The primary outcome was the ovulation rate as determined by urinary progestin.
We proposed an absolute difference of 25% between the two treatment arms
assuming the number of observed ovulations follows a Poisson process and projected a 15% dropout rate for this trial. The ovulation rate in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of troglitazone in PCOS was 32% (13). Based on a projected
ovulation rate of 30% in the lifestyle/placebo arm and 55% in the combined lifestyle/metformin arm, the study required a total of 58 subjects per treatment arm to
have a two-sided test having 80% power with a type I error of 5%.
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to the two treatment arms
each lasting 6 mos using a computer generated random number table using
permuted blocks and stratiﬁed by center and prior metformin exposure status
after a baseline visit. The block schedule was blinded to the investigators and
research subjects. Subjects were advised to use barrier contraception and avoid
pregnancy during the study in order to encourage study completion.

Study Interventions
More complete details can be found in the Supplemental Materials and
Methods section (available online at www.fertstert.org). A combined intervention of diet and exercise was used with the goal of achieving an average
weight loss of R7% of initial body weight over 6 months with a prescription
of 150 min/wk exercise combined with a low-calorie diet (2).

Dietary interventions The number of calories to maintain current body
weight was assessed by combining the analysis of three day diet records obtained during screening (Nutritionist V, First Databank, Sunnyvale, CA) with
the results of the Harris Benedict Equation multiplied by an activity factor of
1.3. The target level of calorie intake was calculated as the daily calories
required to maintain weight minus 500 kcal.
Exercise training The exercise program consisted of supervised and nonsupervised components to maximize ﬂexibility and acceptance of the intervention. Subjects were given the opportunity to attend R2 sessions per
week at a ﬁtness facility run by the research team. Because logistics precluded frequent visits to the training facility, subjects were responsible for
performing aerobic activity on their own to achieve a total exercise time of
150 min/wk (including supervised sessions). Subjects completed a daily
physical activity log once per month.

Medication arm Metformin hydrochloride was obtained as a powder
(Spectrum Chemical Manufacturing, New Brunswick, NJ) and formulated
with the appropriate dose of drug (500 mg/capsule) into capsules with
identical-appearing placebo capsules (9). Drug and placebo were packaged
and labeled according to subject number by the Investigational Pharmacy
laboratory in a double-blind fashion. Medication was initiated in a step-up
fashion every 5 days, from one tablet per day to four. This dose was maintained as tolerated throughout the remainder of the study.

Study Procedures
Urine collections (daily) Subjects collected a ﬁrst morning void urine specimen (10 mL) and refrigerated it. Pregnanediol-3 alpha-glucuronide (PdG) was
determined in an aliquot of diluted human urine by competitive ELISA [Immunometrics (UK), London, UK]. Results were normalized to urine creatinine.
Physical exam (monthly) Hirsutism was assessed by trained study personnel using the modiﬁed Ferriman-Galwey score (14). Facial lesion counts of open

Ladson et al.

Exercise testing (monthly) Before beginning the exercise program and at
each monthly visit during the study, subjects underwent a submaximal test of
aerobic capacity to determine ﬁtness levels (16).
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (baseline and end of
study) Body composition data were determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; QDR-4500W; Hologic, Bedford, MA). Subregion analyses of visceral and central abdominal fat were modeled (17).

cence using the Siemens (Los Angeles, CA) Immulite platform. Testosterone
was measured by RIA (18).

Serum metabolic hormones (baseline and end of study) A 75-g oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with glucose and insulin levels obtained at 0 ,
30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after challenge was performed after an overnight
fast (19). Fasting glucose (FBG), insulin (FI), and lipids were determined as
previously reported (18). The insulinogenic index, a measure of early-phase
insulin secretion, was deﬁned as (30-minute glucose À FBG) divided by
(30-minute insulin À FI) (20). The insulin sensitivity index was calculated
using the formula 10,000/square root of [(FBG)(FI)][(mean OGTT
glucose)(mean OGTT insulin)] (21).

Ultrasound scan (baseline and end of study) A transvaginal or transabdominal (in adolescents) ultrasound of the pelvis was performed (18). Volume of the ovary was calculated by using the formula for a prolate ellipsoid:
length Â height Â width Â (p/6) (18).

PCOS quality of life survey (baseline and end of study) The validated
PCOS Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QOL) questionnaire includes ﬁve
domains: emotional, body hair, infertility, weight, and menstrual problems
(22). Each domain score is graded on a scale of 1 (poorest function) to 7
(optimal), with a change of 0.5 approximating the minimal important difference,
i.e., the smallest change in score that women feel is important in their daily lives.
Determination of the number of ovulations A modiﬁed version of the
Kassam et al. (23) urinary PdG ratio algorithm was used to estimate the number of ovulations. For this study, the modiﬁcations presented by O’Connor
et al. (24) to the Kassam algorithm were sampling every other day with
a baseline calculated using a 3-day rather than a 5-day running average
and the threshold of ratio >3 exceeded for 2, not 3, days.

Data Analyses
Because there were a large number of women with no ovulations in this study,
a zero-altered negative binomial model was ﬁt to compare the number of ovulations (25). Linear mixed-effects models were ﬁt to continuous outcomes to
compare metformin and placebo regarding the change from baseline measurement (26). Adverse event rates were compared between the two treatment arms using Poisson regression models.
All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle, whereby data from
all participants were analyzed according to the assigned treatment group.
All analyses were adjusted for center, prior metformin use, baseline age,
and baseline body mass index (BMI). For change from baseline outcomes,
the models also adjusted for the baseline value of the outcome. No adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing were performed, because all outcomes
other than the primary were considered to be exploratory. All statistical tests
are two sided, and all analyses were performed with SAS software (version
9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with graphics constructed using S-plus (version
8.0; TIBCO Software, Palo Alto, CA).

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics and Subject Retention

Primary and Secondary Outcomes
There was no difference in ovulation rates between groups (Fig. 2A).
The ovulation rate ratio comparing MET and PBO was 2.5 (95%
conﬁdence interval [CI] 0.9–6.6; P¼.07) regarding whether
a woman ovulated or not; the ovulation rate ratio comparing MET
and PBO was 1.2 (95% CI 0.7–1.9; P¼.51) regarding the number
of ovulations if a woman actually had ovulated. Testosterone levels,
however, were only signiﬁcantly less at 3 months in MET compared
with baseline (Fig. 2B) Weight declined signiﬁcantly from baseline
at all points after the ﬁrst month in MET, but the decrease was not
signiﬁcantly different compared with PBO (Fig. 2C).

Other Outcomes at 6 Months
Exercise parameters were not signiﬁcantly different between treatment groups (Supplemental Materials and Methods). There was
a signiﬁcant decrease in systolic blood pressure at 6 months compared with baseline for PBO only, but no change in diastolic blood
pressure or hirsutism or acne scores within either group (Table 2).
There was a signiﬁcant improvement in the area-under-the-curve
glucose in PBO compared with baseline and with MET (P<.001
and P¼.002, respectively) (Supplemental Fig. 1, available online).
Although there were favorable changes compared with baseline in
individual domains in the QOL questionnaire, such as for emotion
and weight within each treatment group, there were no signiﬁcant
differences in the overall well-being scores between treatment
arms at 6 months. There were also no changes in ovarian volume
or size of the largest follicle compared with baseline or between
treatment groups (data not shown).

Side Effects and Adverse Events
There were six dropouts in MET for medication side effects and
none in PBO. In MET, diarrhea and headaches were signiﬁcantly
more common, whereas bladder infections and musculoskeletal
complaints were less common (Supplemental Table 2, available onFertility and Sterilityâ

line). There were no differences in the average percentage of days of
vaginal bleeding during the study: 15 Æ 11% for MET versus 11 Æ
11% for PBO. There were four pregnancies, all in PBO. These resulted in one ﬁrst-trimester miscarriage, one elective abortion, and
one full-term birth of a healthy boy without maternal or fetal pregnancy complications. The fourth pregnancy was lost to follow-up.

DISCUSSION
We found that the addition of metformin to lifestyle had no signiﬁcant beneﬁt on ovulation and circulating androgen levels. However,
owing to a high dropout rate, the present study had limited power to
detect differences between the treatment arms. Nevertheless, we
noted beneﬁcial effects of the addition of metformin to lifestyle, including improved insulin sensitivity and increased bone mineral
density. There was no beneﬁt to either treatment on QOL or skin parameters (acne or hirsutism), though our trial may have been too
short to detect these. With the exception of increased diarrhea and
fewer bladder infections in MET, the therapies were equally well tolerated and safe.
The strengths of the present study include the relatively large
numbers of subjects recruited into a combination lifestyle study, their
racial and socioeconomic diversity, and the detailed study of reproductive and metabolic effects of treatment, including QOL measures
(27). We found no improvement in our primary outcome of ovulation
rates by adding metformin to lifestyle, similarly to the larger study by
Tang et al. (8), which reported change in self-reported menstrual
frequency and did not quantify ovulation. Similarly, a smaller study
in PCOS adolescents showed no change in ovulation, based on
urinary PdG levels, after lifestyle/metformin therapy (10). These
studies also did not detect any additional beneﬁt of lifestyle/
metformin.
Our study demonstrated a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in weight loss with
metformin, at least compared with baseline ($3 kg). This is consistent with the largest trial of metformin alone (with no lifestyle

modiﬁcation) in PCOS, where the 6-month weight loss was $2
kg (28), and with the Diabetes Prevention Program, where metformin was compared with placebo ($2 kg at 6 months). Other
studies have shown similar modest decreases in weight with combination or lifestyle therapy (8–10). However, there are studies of
lifestyle therapy alone in women with PCOS that have shown
signiﬁcantly more weight loss, as much as 8–10 kg, over
a similar period (29).
Metformin may have multiple metabolic beneﬁts in women with
PCOS (30). Metformin signiﬁcantly decreased body fat and also

raised circulating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Fasting or
glucose-challenged glucose levels and the insulinogenic index
were unaltered (31). Improvements in the insulinogenic index lower
diabetes risk, so the relative beneﬁt of lifestyle alone on this parameter is probably small. The relatively small impact of combination
therapy on glycemic parameters is supported by other studies in
women with PCOS with metformin added to oral contraceptives
(32) or to lifestyle (9, 10). Given the absence of glycemic
improvement, weight loss may be the primary metabolic beneﬁt of
metformin in the present study (31).

Metformin and lifestyle therapy in PCOS

Vol. 95, No. 3, March 1, 2011

Increased bone mineral density in MET, after such a short period,
has been seen after prolonged metformin treatment in girls with premature pubarche (33), perhaps due to favorable effects on circulating sex steroids. The impact of this ﬁnding in our older group is
probably minor. We noted no effect of treatment on the hip, and
women with PCOS have generally been noted to have normal or increased bone mineral density, without increased risk for osteoporosis and hip fractures. (34) Although pregnancy was considered to be
an adverse event, we note that all pregnancies occurred in the PBO
arm, further challenging the reproductive beneﬁts of metformin (28)
and supporting lifestyle alone as a treatment for infertility in these
women.
The present study has limitations. Recruitment was slow and
dropout was high. It is possible that with more subjects and a higher
retention rate, we would have demonstrated more beneﬁt with metformin. However, other lifestyle trials in PCOS have had high dropout rates: in adolescents (10) and in an Australian trial of adults (29).
The present project included an urban minority medical center that
focused on recruiting Blacks. The difﬁculty in recruiting and retaining minority women in clinical trials is well known (35). Our study
completion rate of 47% in Whites was similar to that in the Australian trial (50%) which lasted 20 weeks versus our longer 24-week
trial. We further examined factors at baseline and could not identify
factors that predicted dropout. We conclude that it is difﬁcult to individualize lifestyle therapy to those likely to complete all or part of
it.
Our trial also enrolled many subjects who were severely or
morbidly obese, subjects with the most difﬁculty complying and

responding to lifestyle changes. Because of these drawbacks,
some lifestyle studies in PCOS exclude subjects in this BMI range
(36). Our subjects’ predicted maximal oxygen uptake did not change
during the trial, indicating that even the subjects who stayed in the
protocol did not increase their aerobic capacity. Aerobic capacity
and muscle strength has been noted to be similar in PCOS as in
weight-matched control subjects, such that PCOS per se is unlikely
to limit physical activity (37).
Overall, although the effects of lifestyle/metformin, alone or in
combination, are generally beneﬁcial, the absolute changes are quite
modest. Many women with PCOS are unwilling to participate in
such interventions, or lose motivation, and dropout early in the process. Therefore, the external validity of such studies, given the low
rate of study completion, is questionable. These results bring into
doubt routine recommendations that lifestyle is effective therapy
for severely obese women with PCOS (6, 7). More meaningful
reproductive and metabolic changes in women with PCOS may be
achieved in this weight group with massive weight loss, such as
from bariatric surgery (38).

SUPPLEMEMENTAL MATERIALS AND METHODS
Lifestyle Interventions

sensitivity of this PdG assay is 2.5 nmol/L, and intra- and interassay
imprecision averaged 5% and 7%, respectively, at mean concentrations of
$125 nmol/L. Results were normalized to urine creatinine.

All subjects received the lifestyle intervention. A combined intervention of
diet and exercise was used with the goal of achieving an average weight
loss of R7% of initial body weight over 6 months. This weight loss target
echoed that of the Diabetes Prevention Program (1) with a prescription of
150 min/wk exercise combined with a low-calorie diet.

Physical exam (monthly) Hirsutism was assessed by trained study
personnel using the modiﬁed Ferriman-Galwey score (4). Facial lesion
counts of open and closed comedones (noninﬂammatory lesions) were
obtained from the forehead, left, and right cheeks, nose, and chin by
trained study personnel (5).

Dietary intervention Before beginning the dietary intervention, subjects were instructed to maintain a 3-day food log. The number of calories
to maintain current body weight was assessed by combining the analysis
of the 3-day diet records (Nutritionist V; First Databank, Sunnyvale, CA)
with the results of the Harris-Benedict equation multiplied by an activity
factor of 1.3. The target level of calorie intake was calculated as the daily
calories required to maintain weight minus 500 kcal. The food exchange
system was used to attain this target intake. The target macronutrient
composition was 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein. This
system was implemented and monitored with monthly meetings between
the subjects and a registered dietitian.

Exercise testing (monthly) Before beginning the exercise program and

Exercise training The exercise program consisted of supervised and nonsupervised components to maximize ﬂexibility and acceptance of the intervention. Subjects were given the opportunity to attend R2 sessions per week at
a ﬁtness facility run by the research team. Workouts consisted of a 5-minute
warm-up period followed by a 30–45-minute workout at 60%–75% of
predicted maximal heart rate using one of several modes, i.e., stair stepper,
stationary bike, elliptical machine, treadmill, or dancing to music. During
all workouts, subjects wore a Polar heart rate monitor (S610; Polar Electro,
Woodbury, NY) that recorded heart rate, duration, and caloric expenditure
during the exercise. A personal trainer trained in ﬁtness assessment
supervised workouts and performed monthly reviews with the subjects.
Problems of compliance were addressed by the study coordinator.
No exercise records were available for ﬁve subjects. The number of workout
sessions per week averaged 2.5 Æ 1.2 (metformin group [MET]) and 2.5 Æ 1.8
(placebo group [PBO]) workouts per week. Average duration for each workout
was 39 Æ 17 minutes (MET) and 39 Æ 9 (PBO) minutes, and the average heart
rate was 138 Æ 19 beats/min (MET) and 146 Æ 12 (PBO) beats/min or overall
74% of age-predicted maximal heart rate. There was no signiﬁcant change in
maximal oxygen uptake between groups. The average rating of perceived exertion (2) was 13 Æ 2 (MET) and 15 Æ 3 (PBO)m indicating that subjects rated
the exercise as ‘‘somewhat hard’’ to ‘‘hard.’’ The most common exercise modes
were walking, treadmill running and walking, elliptical machine use, and stationary cycling. Subjects also self-reported a signiﬁcant increase in the days
per week of exercise from an average of 2.0 Æ 1.3 to 3.0 Æ 1.4 (MET;
P¼.01) and 1.5 Æ 1.7 to 3.1 Æ 1.4 (PBO; P<.001).
Because logistics precluded frequent visits to the training facility, subjects
were responsible for performing aerobic activity on their own to achieve a total exercise time of 150 min/wk (including supervised sessions). Subjects
completed a daily physical activity log once per month. Subjects were counseled monthly about ways to increase their nonpurposeful activity and to
corroborate the records of workouts from the heart rate monitor.

Medication arm Metformin hydrochloride was obtained as a powder
(Spectrum Chemical Manufacturing, New Brunswick, NJ) and formulated
with the appropriate dose of drug into capsules with identical-appearing
placebo capsules (3). Drug and placebo were packaged and labeled according
to subject number by the Investigational Pharmacy laboratory in a doubleblind fashion. Medication was initiated in a step-up fashion every 5 days,
from one tablet per day to four. This dose was maintained as tolerated
throughout the remainder of the study.

Study Procedures
Urine collections (daily) Subjects collected a ﬁrst morning void urine
specimen (10 mL) and refrigerated it. Pregnanediol-3 alpha-glucuronide
(PdG) was determined in an aliquot of diluted human urine by competitive
ELISA (Immunometrics (UK), London, UK). The low-end functional

at each monthly visit during the study, subjects underwent a submaximal test of
aerobic capacity to determine ﬁtness levels (6). This test involved riding
a stationary bike at several different workloads for a total of 6–12 minutes while
the heart rate was monitored with a Polar heart rate monitor at regular intervals.

Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (baseline and end of
study) Body composition data were determined by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry using QDR-4500W (Hologic, Bedford, MA). Each
participant underwent a total-body scan and dual hip scans using the fanbeam mode at baseline and at the completion of the study. Subregion
analyses of visceral and central abdominal fat were modeled (7).

Serum reproductive hormones (baseline, 3 months, and end
of study) LH, FSH, DHEAS, and SHBG were determined by chemiluminescence using the Siemens (Los Angeles, CA) Immulite platform. Testosterone was measured by RIA (8).

Serum metabolic hormones (baseline and end of study) A
75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with glucose and insulin levels obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after challenge was performed after
an overnight fast (9). Fasting glucose (FBG), insulin (FI), and lipids were
determined as previously reported (8). The insulinogenic index, a measure
of early-phase insulin secretion, was deﬁned as (30-minute glucose À FBG)
divided by (30-minute insulin À FI) (12). The insulin sensitivity index was
calculated using the formula of Matsuda and DeFronzo (11): 10,000/square
root of [(FBG)(FI)][(mean OGTT glucose)(mean OGTT insulin)].
Ultrasound scan (baseline and end of study) A transvaginal or
transabdominal (in adolescents) ultrasound of the pelvis was performed
(8). Volume of the ovary was calculated using the formula for a prolate
ellipsoid: length Â height Â width Â (p/6) (8).
PCOS quality of life survey (baseline and end of study) The
validated PCOS Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QOL) questionnaire
includes ﬁve domains: emotional, body hair, infertility, weight, and
menstrual problems (12). Each domain score is graded on a scale of 1
(poorest function) to 7 (optimal), with a change of 0.5 approximating the
minimal important difference, i.e., the smallest change in score that
women feel is important in their daily lives.

Determination of the number of ovulations A modiﬁed version of
the Kassam et al. (13) urinary PdG ratio algorithm was used to estimate the
number of ovulations. For the present study, the modiﬁcations presented by
O’Connor et al. (14) to the Kassam algorithm were sampling every other
day with a baseline calculated using a 3-day rather than a 5-day running
average and the threshold of ratio >3 exceeded for 2, not 3, days.
Data Analyses
Because there were a large number of women with no ovulations in the present study, a zero-altered negative binomial model was ﬁt to compare the number of ovulations (15). The zero-altered negative binomial model allowed us to
examine if there was a difference between treatment arms whether a woman
ovulated or not; it also allowed us to examine if there was a difference between
treatment arms regarding the number of ovulations a woman had.
Linear mixed-effects models were ﬁt to continuous outcomes, such as
total testosterone or the free androgen index, to compare metformin and
placebo regarding the change from baseline measurement (16). The linear
mixed-effects model is an extension of multiple linear regression and allowed for estimation of the within-subject and between-subject correlations

1066.e1

in this longitudinal trial. Contrasts were constructed to compare metformin
and placebo for the change in an outcome from the randomization visit to
the end of therapy. Adverse event rates were compared between the two
treatment arms by using Poisson regression models.
All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principles, whereby data from
all participants were analyzed according to the assigned treatment group. All
analyses were adjusted for center, prior metformin use, baseline age, and

baseline body mass index. For change from baseline outcomes, the models
also adjusted for the baseline value of the outcome. No adjustments for multiple hypothesis testing were performed, because all outcomes other than the
primary were considered to be exploratory. All statistical tests are two sided,
and all analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with graphics constructed using S-plus (version 8.0; Tibco
Software, Palo Alto, CA).
