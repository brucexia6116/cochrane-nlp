Background: Patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may be managed with different
treatment options. This study compared the effectiveness of three commonly used non-surgical treatment
modalities.
Methods: Subjects with mild to moderate OSA were randomised to one of three treatment groups for
10 weeks: conservative measures (sleep hygiene) only, continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) in
addition to conservative measures or an oral appliance in addition to conservative measures. All overweight
subjects were referred to a weight-reduction class. OSA was assessed by polysomnography. Blood pressure
was recorded in the morning and evening in the sleep laboratory. Daytime sleepiness was assessed with the
Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed with the 36-Item Short-Form
Health Survey (SF-36) and Sleep Apnoea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI).
Results: <n>101</n> subjects with a mean (SEM) apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI) of 21.4 (1.1) were randomised to
one of the three groups. The severity of sleep-disordered breathing was decreased in the CPAP and oral
appliance groups compared with the conservative measures group, and the CPAP group was significantly
better than the oral appliance group. Relief from sleepiness was significantly better in the CPAP group. CPAP
was also better than the oral appliance or conservative measures in improving the ‘‘bodily pain’’ domain,
and better than conservative measures in improving the ‘‘physical function’’ domain of SF-36. Both CPAP and
the oral appliance were more effective than conservative measures in improving the SAQLI, although no
difference was detected between the CPAP and oral appliance groups. CPAP and the oral appliance
significantly lowered the morning diastolic blood pressure compared with baseline values, but there was no
difference in the changes in blood pressure between the groups. There was also a linear relationship between
the changes in AHI and body weight.
Conclusion: CPAP produced the best improvement in terms of physiological, symptomatic and HRQOL
measures, while the oral appliance was slightly less effective. Weight loss, if achieved, resulted in an
improvement in sleep parameters, but weight control alone was not uniformly effective.

bstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disorder in
various communities.1 2 Affected patients have neurocognitive and neurobehavioural impairment,3 and are at
risk of developing long-term vascular consequences.4
Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) is widely considered as the treatment of choice because of its high and
consistent efficacy on various outcome measures.5–7 Although it
is controversial whether cardiovascular pathogenesis and
clinical morbidity is proportional to the severity of OSA
reflected by sleep indices, it has been suggested that those
with severe sleep-disordered breathing should be treated
irrespective of symptoms, while those with milder disease are
treated mainly for functional symptoms. Thus, for subjects with
mild or moderate OSA, improvement in functional morbidity is
the major goal of treatment. However, adherence to CPAP in
these subjects is lower than in those with severe OSA,8 and this
may compromise its overall effectiveness. The use of an oral
appliance has been shown to reduce the severity of sleepdisordered breathing and leads to symptomatic improvement,
especially in mild to moderate OSA, and patients seem to be
more compliant to this treatment than CPAP.9 10 Weight
reduction has always been advocated in patients with OSA
who are overweight, and may lead to improvement in the
severity of OSA.11 In clinical practice, patients may express the
desire to adopt weight-control measures first before device use
when they have only mild or moderate OSA. Unfortunately,
weight loss is difficult to achieve and maintain.12

There have been several randomised studies on various
treatment modalities in mild to moderate OSA. The studies
comprised two treatment arms,9 10 13–17 except a recent trial from
Australia in which three regimes were compared.18 Treatment
outcome measures usually included sleep parameters and
daytime sleepiness, while data on the comprehensive evaluation of functional status as reflected by health-related quality of
life (HRQOL) have been limited.14 16–18 This study was designed
to assess the effectiveness of the three commonly used nonsurgical treatment modalities in mild to moderate OSA, with
regard to daytime sleepiness, HRQOL and physiological parameters.

METHODS
Subjects and study protocol
Subjects were consecutively recruited from the sleep laboratories of a university hospital and a regional hospital. Inclusion
criteria were apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI) >5–40 and
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)19 .9 for those with AHI 5–
20. Exclusion criteria were the presence of sleepiness which
may constitute risk to self or others, unstable medical diseases,

coexistence of sleep disorders other than OSA, history of
previous surgery to upper airway (except those for nasal
problems) and pregnant women. At baseline, all subjects
underwent demographic documentation and anthropometric
measurements. Blood pressure was recorded both on the night
of polysomnography (PSG) and the next morning. Daytime
sleepiness was assessed with ESS. HRQOL was assessed with
the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)20 and the Sleep
Apnoea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI).21 Subjects were then
randomised into three treatment groups: conservative measures
only (advice on general sleep hygiene measures were given, and
those who were overweight were asked to attend a weightcontrol programme in the Dietetics Unit, Queen Mary Hospital,
Hong Kong SAR, China; conservative measures group),
conservative measures in addition to CPAP (CPAP group) or
conservative measures in addition to an oral appliance (oral
appliance group). According to Asian criteria for overweight
and obesity, as explored by the World Health Organization,
subjects were considered to be overweight if their body mass
index was >23 kg/m2.22 23 Those in the CPAP group were
prescribed CPAP (ARIA LX, Respironics, Atlanta, Georgia, USA)
at a pre-titrated pressure. Subjects in the oral appliance group
were referred to an orthodontist (KS) for a tailor-made nonadjustable oral appliance. The oral appliance was made of
dental acrylic modified from a functional activator (Harvold
type). It held the mandible in a forward direction with some
vertical opening to keep the jaw at the most advanced position
without causing discomfort.24
At 10 weeks, all subjects were reassessed with the same
battery of tests as at the baseline. The CPAP and oral appliance
groups underwent PSG using the respective device, and had
another PSG without the assigned device after stopping its use
for 1 week, in order to assess the effect of conservative
measures on sleep parameters in these groups. The conservative
measures group underwent PSG without any device.
The study was approved by the respective institutional ethics
committee. All subjects gave written informed consent.

Polysomnography
Subjects underwent overnight PSG (Alice 3 or Alice 4
Diagnostics System, Respironics, Atlanta, USA) with documentation of sleep stages by EEG, respiratory movement by
impedance plethysmography, air flow by nasal pressure sensor
with thermistor back up, arterial oxygen saturation by pulse
oximetry, snoring by tracheal microphone and sleep position by
position sensor. All sleep data and respiratory events were
manually scored according to standard criteria.25 26
Blood pressure
Blood pressure was measured with Dinamap (Critikon, Tampa,
Florida, USA) in the evening (20:00–21:00) on the day of
admission to the sleep study and the next morning on waking
(8:00–9:00). The average of three readings taken at 1 min
intervals was documented as morning and evening blood
pressure readings.
Health-related quality of life assessment

Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-36)
This is a generic self-completed questionnaire that measures eight
dimensions of health: physical functioning, role limitation due to
physical problems (role-physical), bodily pain, general health
perceptions, energy/vitality, social functioning, role limitation due
to emotional problems (role-emotional) and mental health.20
Sleep Apnoea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI)
This is a sleep apnoea-specific questionnaire consisting of four
core domains: daily functioning, social interactions, emotional

355

functioning and symptoms. The SAQLI also includes a domain
specific for treatment-related problems which is useful for
comparing the effectiveness of different treatment options.21
The SAQLI was translated from English to Chinese following
existing guidelines to preserve equivalence.27
Treatment adherence and treatment-related side effects
Adherence to the assigned treatment was recorded at 4 weeks
and at 10 weeks. Data regarding CPAP use were downloaded
from the internal memory of the CPAP device and adherence to
use of the oral appliance was assessed through self-reporting.
Body weight was measured. Side effects of treatment were
evaluated by self-reporting using questionnaires in a clinical
setting.
Statistical analysis
The sample size was 105 subjects with 35 in each treatment
group. The calculation was based on the analysis of variance
with a minimum between-group difference of three units in
ESS, a standard deviation of four units,15 80% power, 5% chance
of committing a type 1 error and 10% attrition. The
randomisation list was generated by the Statistical Analysis
System. Baseline comparisons among groups were made by
analysis of variance. For the analysis by intention-to-treat
(ITT), missing values were replaced by the baseline values.
Within-group comparison was examined by paired t test. Posttreatment changes were analysed based on both the ITT
principle with inclusion of all study patients and per-protocol
set which included only patients with observed outcomes. The
comparisons were made by regression analysis with the
adjustment of baseline values. A closed test procedure was
used to account for multiplicity in post hoc comparisons. The
association between changes in body weight and changes in
AHI was examined by Pearson’s correlation after checking for
normality. To determine whether this association was independent of treatment exposure, linear regression was performed with change in AHI as the dependent variable. The
independent variables included the change in body weight,
treatment groups and the interaction between change in body
weight and treatment group. Results are given as mean (SEM)
unless otherwise stated. All statistical tests were two-sided
using 0.05 as the level of significance. All analyses were made
in SPSS V.11.0.

RESULTS
Subjects
In all, 109 subjects were approached and eight refused to join
the study. Thus, 101 subjects were recruited with mean (SEM)
AHI of 21.4 (1.1), and randomised into one of the three
treatment arms (table 1). All subjects were advised on sleep
hygiene measures with particular relevance to OSA and weight
control. In addition, 84 subjects were referred to the weightcontrol programme.
Subjects randomised to the CPAP and oral appliance groups
received the devices as described above; 10 subjects withdrew
(one in the CPAP group due to intolerance of the device, four in
the oral appliance group due to gum problems and five in the
conservative measures group who refused to undergo PSG at
10 weeks). There was no significant difference in baseline
demographics and sleep parameters between those who
completed the study and those who did not.
Sleep study parameters
Compared with baseline, both CPAP and the oral appliance
significantly improved hypoxaemia and AHI, although an AHI
,5 could only be achieved by CPAP, and improvement in
arousal index was only significant in the CPAP group (table 1).

The conservative measures group showed no significant change
in AHI. The difference in the improvement in AHI between the
groups was statistically significant (fig 1). Compared with
baseline, PSG performed on subjects in the CPAP and oral
appliance groups (without using the assigned treatment)
showed no significant change in sleep parameters (online
supplementary fig R1; see http://thorax.bmj.com/supplemental).
Of the 91 subjects who completed the study and underwent
body weight measurement, 45 subjects had a decrease, 35 had
an increase and 11 had no change in body weight. Among the
45 subjects (15, 15 and 15 subjects in conservative measures,
oral appliance and CPAP groups, respectively) who had a
decrease in body weight (from 75.8 (1.6) kg to 72.5 (1.5) kg),
AHI decreased from 24.6 (1.7) to 19.1 (2.0). However, among
the three groups, only subjects in the CPAP group had
significant weight loss compared with their baseline values
(table 1). Eight subjects achieved an AHI ,5 (baseline AHI 14.6
(3.0)) on reassessment without a device, with an average
weight loss of 2.9 (1.0) kg.
There was a linear relationship between the changes in AHI
(without device use) and body weight (r = 0.298, p = 0.004;
fig 2), which was independent of the treatment used.

groups (table 1). The improvement in ESS score was greater

36-Item Short-Form Health Survey
At baseline, the scores of all domains of SF-36 in subjects with
OSA were lower than the norm scores (data not shown) of the
local community.28 After treatment, CPAP led to improvement
in six of the domains, except social functioning and mental
health. Use of an oral appliance led to improvement in three
domains: general health perceptions, vitality and role-emotional. Conservative measures led to no significant change in
any domains.
Comparison of the three groups showed that CPAP had
significantly greater improvement than the oral appliance or
conservative measures in the ‘‘bodily pain’’ domain, and than
conservative measures in the ‘‘physical functioning’’ domain
(table 2).

Compared with the baseline values, CPAP led to improvement
in all four domains, the oral appliance led to improvement in
three domains except social interaction, while the conservative
measures group showed no significant change.
Among the three treatment groups, both CPAP and the oral
appliance produced significantly greater improvement than
conservative measures except for the ‘‘social interaction’’

CPAP was superior to the oral appliance if domain E was not
included (ie, total score A–D), although the difference between
the CPAP and the oral appliance groups no longer existed when

Treatment adherence and complications
All subjects in the CPAP group reported some degree of side
effects attributed to CPAP use, including dryness of the nose,
mouth or throat (n = 16, 47%), feeling of pressure (n = 11,
32%), noise from machine (n = 8, 24%) and facial skin abrasion
(n = 7, 21%). The mean (SEM) CPAP use was 4.4 (0.1) nights
per week and 4.2 (0.1) h per night. In the oral appliance group,
side effects experienced included excessive salivation (n = 19,
56%), temporomandibular joint discomfort (n = 13, 38%),
dryness of the throat (n = 11, 33%) and tooth discomfort
(n = 11, 33%). All side effects were considered as mild and
acceptable. The self-reported use of the treatment device was
5.2 (0.3) nights per week and 6.4 (0.2) h per night. No
particular side effects related to lifestyle modification measures
were reported.

DISCUSSION
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of three
commonly used treatment modalities for patients with mild to
moderate OSA. Our findings showed that CPAP was superior to
either an oral appliance or conservative measures in improving
daytime sleepiness. Both CPAP and an oral appliance in
addition to conservative management were more effective than
conservative measures alone in improving sleep parameters and
HRQOL. Both CPAP and oral appliance produced significantly
greater improvements in sleep parameters than conservative
measures, with CPAP superior to an oral appliance. Behavioural
modification as a treatment measure alone may be of clinical
benefit in some individuals, but as a group, it did not result in
any significant change in sleep-disordered breathing, daytime
sleepiness or HRQOL.

Similar to previous reports, we showed that CPAP was
superior to either an oral appliance or conservative management alone in improving sleep-disordered breathing parameters. As the overall effectiveness of treatment intervention in
chronic conditions depends heavily on adherence to treatment,
the improvement in sleep parameters seen on a one-night PSG
while using a device may not adequately reflect its ultimate
effectiveness alleviating the morbidity of OSA. Hence, functional assessment assumes a relatively major role in the
evaluation of treatment effectiveness, especially in those with
mild to moderate OSA in whom the concern for potential
cardiovascular morbidity may be relatively less than in those
with severe OSA.
CPAP has been shown to be effective in improving subjective
sleepiness in subjects with severe OSA,29 but not consistently so
in milder cases.13 14 16 We showed an improvement in subjective
sleepiness compared with their baseline values in all three
treatment arms, and those treated with CPAP had a greater
improvement than either the oral appliance group or conservative measures group. Although we cannot rule out a
placebo effect of the various interventions including weight
reduction, the beneficial effect of CPAP beyond that of either
conservative management alone or with an oral appliance was
clearly shown. Despite a significant decrease in AHI in the oral
appliance group, no significant difference in relieving daytime
sleepiness was shown when compared with the conservative
measures group. This could be due to limited sample size or the
fact that the conservative measures group also showed some
improvement in ESS.
It is well documented that HRQOL in severe OSA is impaired,
and CPAP treatment can improve this.29 For subjects with
milder disease, the effect of OSA treatment on HRQOL is more
controversial, and the information has been mostly derived
from studies with CPAP treatment,13 14 and a few recent studies
comparing an oral appliance with CPAP.18 30 31 Both generic and
sleep apnoea-specific HRQOL questionnaires have been applied
in this trial. The SF-36 allows subjects to assess their ability in
performing everyday activities and subsequent comparisons to
be made between different groups of subjects with the same or
different diseases, but it may not focus adequately on the area
of interest in a particular disease or a specific intervention. The
disease-specific tool, SAQLI, measures different aspects of
HRQOL that are important for OSA and compares the
effectiveness of different treatment options. In a recent crossover study of CPAP, oral appliance and placebo pill, both CPAP
and the oral appliance improved the quality of life (mean SF-36
score), neuropsychological function and subjective sleepiness,
and no differences were found between CPAP and the oral
appliance. In our study, CPAP was significantly better than the
oral appliance or conservative measures in improving certain
domains of SF-36. However, on using SAQLI, we found that the
difference between CPAP and the oral appliance was no longer
seen when domain E was included in the total score. Although
it has been observed clinically in some patients that side effects
associated with CPAP may have an impact on their subjective
well-being, it is probably the first time that it has been shown
in a randomised study that the beneficial effects of CPAP on
HRQOL may be reduced by treatment-related side effects. This
has significant clinical implications because adherence to any
treatment is probably affected by both its efficacy and
treatment-related problems.
There is evidence of a causal role of OSA in hypertension, and
several randomised controlled studies have shown that CPAP
may decrease blood pressure in both normotensive and
hypertensive subjects with severe OSA,5 while one study has
also shown a similar beneficial effect of an oral appliance
compared with a placebo device in subjects with mild or

moderate OSA.32 We were able to show a difference in morning
diastolic blood pressure within the CPAP and oral appliance
groups, but there was no significant difference in the changes
among groups. Our finding was at variance with that of the
randomised crossover study which similarly comprised subjects
with mild or moderate OSA, where a significant improvement
in night diastolic blood pressure was only seen with oral
appliance treatment, compared with CPAP or placebo pill.18 The
lack of any intergroup difference in our study may be due to the
lesser severity of OSA in the study subjects compared with
previous randomised trials, a small insignificant effect of conservative measures alone and/or the difference in the method of
blood pressure monitoring. Nonetheless, our finding of withingroup differences in both the CPAP and oral appliance groups,
but not in the conservative measures group, suggests that a
beneficial effect on blood pressure can be achieved if the sleepdisordered breathing is effectively controlled.
Obesity is one of the major risk factors for OSA. A
population-based longitudinal study showed that a 10% weight
gain predicted an increase in AHI of approximately 32%, while
a 10% weight loss predicted a 26% decrease in AHI.11 Our results
confirmed that weight change correlated with change in AHI.
With weight reduction alone, only about 10% of the subjects
achieved an AHI ,5. This could be related to insufficient
weight loss for most subjects. Furthermore, weight loss alone
may not necessarily lead to complete resolution of sleep apnoea
as craniofacial factors also have a role in the development of
OSA, especially in Chinese subjects.33 34 Weight-control measures are often requested as a first option of management by
many patients who are overweight and who have OSA, and
who do not like the idea of using a device every night. It is
disappointing that, as a group, those on conservative measures
alone had no significant decrease in body weight, improvement
in sleep parameters or improvement in HRQOL. However,
weight control should still be advised as sleep-disordered
breathing is improved in individuals who lose weight. Among
the three groups, only the CPAP group showed a significant
decrease in body weight. It is possible that these subjects were
more motivated or energetic after CPAP treatment to adhere to
weight-control measures, although this hypothesis was not
substantiated by a recent study.35
There are several limitations in our study. First, there was no
control group without any form of intervention or with a
placebo device. However, the differences in the effects between
the CPAP group and the oral appliance group would suggest
that the beneficial effect of CPAP over conservative measures
alone could not be solely attributed to a placebo effect of device
use. Second, we used a non-adjustable oral appliance, and the
results may not be generalisable to other oral appliance models.
However, the magnitude of improvement in sleep parameters
with the oral appliance was similar to that in most other
reported series. It is possible that, if an oral appliance could
correct sleep-disordered breathing events to the same extent as
CPAP, the improvement in functional and other outcome measures might also be similar to that seen with CPAP treatment.
