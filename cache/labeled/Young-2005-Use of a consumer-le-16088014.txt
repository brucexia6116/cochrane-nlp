Objective: Client-centered care is a major aim of health care. In mental
health, new client-centered treatment approaches that emphasize recovery, rehabilitation, and empowerment can improve outcomes for people
with severe and persistent mental illness. However, these approaches are
not widely used, in part because many clinicians lack the necessary competencies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
an innovative, consumer-led intervention, Staff Supporting Skills for SelfHelp, which was designed to improve provider quality, empower mental
health consumers, and promote mutual support. Methods: The study was
conducted at five large community mental health provider organizations
in two western states. One organization in each state received the intervention. The intervention included education, clinician-client dialogues,
ongoing technical assistance, and support of self-help. It focused on
client-centered care, rehabilitation, and recovery. A one-year controlled
trial evaluated the effect of the intervention on clinicians’ competencies,
care processes, and the formation of mutual support groups. Outcomes
were assessed by using competency assessment survey instruments and
semistructured interviews with clinicians and managers. Results: A total
of <n>269</n> clinicians participated in the study: 151 in the intervention group
and 118 in the control group. Compared with clinicians at the control organizations, clinicians at intervention organizations showed significantly
greater improvement in education about care, rehabilitation methods,
natural supports, holistic approaches, teamwork, overall competency, and
recovery orientation. Conclusions: A feasible, consumer-led intervention
improves provider competencies in domains that are necessary for the
provision of high-quality care. (Psychiatric Services 56:967–975, 2005)

T

here are pervasive problems
with the quality of care provided to people with severe and
persistent mental illness, and few interventions have been empirically
demonstrated to improve the structure or process of care for these disorders (1–3). For example, treatment
guidelines strongly recommend that
clients have access to vocational rehabilitation and caregiver services, but
these services are seldom used (4–6).
The Institute of Medicine examined prevalent problems with health
care and identified client-centered
care as one of six major targets for
quality improvement (7). Client-centered care refers to collaboration between clinicians and informed, empowered clients to ensure that treatment respects clients’ needs and preferences (8). Client-centered care is
particularly important for chronic illnesses, including chronic psychiatric
disorders (9). People who actively
participate in their care are known to
have better outcomes (10,11); yet it
has been hard to move this principle
into practice. This study evaluated a
consumer-led intervention to improve provider quality and empower
consumers. The intervention is
grounded in an emerging national
movement of consumers with severe
mental illness. This study is one of the
first to examine whether consumers
can drive an intervention to improve
care for chronic illness.
Most efforts to improve care have
967

focused on best practices, which are
defined by scientific evidence and
clinical experience. In mental health,
treatment guidelines have been developed. However, there are barriers
to using these guidelines to improve
care. For one, shortcomings of existing medical records make it very difficult to know when clients are receiving guideline-concordant mental
health services (12). A complementary approach to improving care and
the mental health workforce focuses
on clinicians’ competencies that are
important but are not targeted by
standards-based approaches—for example, attitudes (13). Competencies
are attitudes, knowledge, and skills
that are causally related to effective
job performance (14). Competencies
have been shown to affect the delivery of appropriate care (15) and can
be accurately assessed by using direct
observation, standardized simulations, and written surveys (16,17).
Competency assessment can inform
efforts to improve care by using clinician recruitment, training, and profiling. Although core competencies
have been defined for clinicians who
provide care to people with severe
and persistent mental illness (18), little research has evaluated interventions to improve these competencies.
A lack of competencies among
many clinicians has been implicated
as a critical barrier to providing highquality mental health care (19). Currently, more than three-quarters of
mental health clinicians in the United
States have a bachelor’s degree or less
education (20), and a large proportion
of clinicians lack the skills necessary
to deliver evidence-based practices
(18). For example, professionals often
have negative attitudes toward rehabilitation and mutual support (21)
and underestimate consumers’ interest in collaborative treatment planning (22). Negative attitudes such as
these have hindered the adoption of
innovations (23).
The objective of this study was to
evaluate the effectiveness of a novel,
consumer-led intervention designed
to improve provider competency and
empower consumers. Although a variety of interventions have the potential to make care more client centered, one promising approach be968

gins with the increasingly influential
movement of mental health consumers (24–26). Consumer leaders
have influenced care through advocacy, mutual support, and consumerrun services (27,28). This study evaluated the intervention Staff Supporting Skills for Self-Help, which was
developed and implemented by consumers. This intervention promotes
client-centered care and recovery,
which has been defined as living “a
satisfying life within the limitations
caused by illness” (29). Staff Supporting Skills for Self-Help focuses
on established principles of rehabilitation (30,31) and includes education, structured dialogues between
clinicians and clients, and ongoing

technical assistance. It promotes mutual support. We report on a prospective, controlled evaluation of the effectiveness of this intervention over a
one-year period at five large community mental health organizations in
two states.

Methods
Project sites were part of provider organizations that provided care by using Medicaid funds managed by ValueOptions, a large behavioral health
care organization. Provider organizations were selected for our study if
they served a large population with
severe and persistent mental illness,
were willing to participate, and provided similar types of services. Two
PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES

organizations were selected in Arizona, and three were selected in Colorado. In Arizona, both organizations
provide housing and treatment in a
large urban area. One organization
has three clinical sites and about 100
clinicians and 140 clients. The other
organization has two sites and about
100 clinicians and 80 clients. In Colorado, the three organizations provide case management, psychotherapy, and housing in small urban and
rural areas. The first organization has
two sites and about 25 clinical staff
and 130 clients; the second organization has two sites and about 20 clinical staff and 120 clients; and the third
has three sites and about 50 clinical
staff and 160 clients.
Among the clients served by the
participating organizations, 72 percent were white, 17 percent were
Hispanic, 7 percent were black, and 2
percent were Asian. Sixty-four percent were male, 25 percent had at
least one psychiatric hospitalization
during the past year, and 77 percent
had a primary diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.
This study used a quasi-experimental design. One organization in each
state was assigned to the intervention
for one year. Remaining organizations
continued with usual care. Each state
included both intervention and control organizations, ensuring that external events (for example, changes in
state policy) would not be confounded with the intervention. In Colorado, to reduce travel costs for intervention staff, the closest organization
to the ValueOptions offices was assigned to the intervention. This organization had three sites. In Arizona,
the organization that appeared most
enthusiastic was selected for the intervention. This organization had
three sites. The study was approved
by the RAND institutional review
board.
At each site, clinicians were recruited to participate in our study if they
provided care to people with severe
and persistent mental illness. The
only exception was clinicians from
homeless outreach and day treatment
programs; they were excluded because they represented a small number of staff who performed unique,
more specialized types of job duties.

Written informed consent was obtained from participants.
Intervention
The intervention was developed and
delivered by two of the authors,
Knight and Vogel. Both are consumers of mental health services.
Knight is vice-president for recovery,
rehabilitation, and mutual support for
ValueOptions Healthcare, and Vogel
is executive director of Double Trouble in Recovery, a national self-help
organization. They developed Staff
Supporting Skills for Self-Help by involving consumers and providers
from across the United States in
structured dialogues and focus
groups and by modifying successful
preexisting mutual support programs
(26,32).
Manuals for implementation of
Staff Supporting Skills for Self-Help
are available from Knight (edward.
knight@valueoptions.com) or Vogel
(hv613@aol.com). Table 1 describes
the six components of the intervention that involve clinicians. The components Scientific Presentation on
Self-Help and Structured Dialogues
were conducted in January and February 2001, Rehabilitation Readiness
was conducted in May and June 2001,
Strategies for Independence in November 2001, and Professional Support Skills for Self-Help in January
2002. Detailing, another component
of the intervention, included four
full-day visits to Arizona sites and
three full-day visits to Colorado sites
during the intervention year. An additional 16 hours were spent meeting at
various times with staff at the sites.
The intervention also has components that involve only consumers.
Technical assistance was provided to
consumers to encourage and facilitate the formation of consumer-operated services, such as mutual support groups, drop-in centers, and
health education programs. There
was a focus on two prepackaged mutual support groups: Double Trouble
in Recovery and Wellness in Numbers. In Double Trouble in Recovery
the 12-step Alcoholics Anonymous
model was tailored to the needs of
people with severe and persistent
mental illness. Participation in Double Trouble in Recovery has been asPSYCHIATRIC SERVICES

Clinician-related components of a consumer-led intervention, Staff Supporting
Skills for Self-Help
Component
Scientific presentation on self-help

Assess clinicians’ previous support of selfhelp and empowerment. Present scientific material about recovery, rehabilitation, and self-help. Discuss ways to involve consumers in increasing self-help
and mutual support.

Structured dialogues

Hold small groups with equal numbers
of consumers and clinicians. Focus on
barriers to self-help. Discuss hopelessness regarding severe and persistent
mental illness and compare with experiences that create hope. Discuss factors
that impede and promote recovery, how
self-help complements traditional
treatment, and resistance to self-help.

Rehabilitation readiness

Present clinicians with rehabilitation
readiness concepts and skills to help
consumers set goals and develop coping
strategies. Present information about
how clinicians can manage their own
stressors, consumer demands, and the
larger mental health system.

Strategies for independence

Focus on strategies for minimizing consumer dependence on mental health
professionals. Discuss consumer responsibility for recovery, consumer and
clinician behaviors that interfere with
progress and reduce quality of life,
and strategies to help clinicians tolerate
their discomfort with consumers
practicing new behaviors.

Professional skills supporting self-help

Use small groups and role-playing techniques. Focus on helping staff understand how to support self-help without
being intrusive. Present theories about
self-help success, the characteristics of
common mutual support groups,
and how traditional treatment can support consumers’ progress regarding selfhelp.

Detailing

Continue to meet as needed with clinicians. Provide individual advice, group
presentations, and role-playing techniques for problems.

greater well-being (33,34). Wellness
in Numbers is a manualized group
model that includes examination of
one’s own behaviors, open sharing or
guided meditation, and reading
about or hearing speakers discuss recovery. At the start of the intervention, a Consumer Mutual Support

Day was held at each site that included research presentations, structured questions, and small group discussions. Consumer leaders were
identified and charged with starting
mutual support groups. Encouragement was provided to local consumer leaders throughout the year,
and a fund was established to provide logistical support for mutual

Measures
We measured the effect of the intervention on clinicians’ competencies,
care processes, and the formation of
mutual support. Competencies were
assessed at baseline and at one year
with a written survey questionnaire
that clinicians confidentially completed. The questionnaire included 55
items from the Competency Assessment Instrument (CAI), an established instrument that has good internal consistency, test-retest reliability,
concurrent validity, and construct validity (16). The CAI is available at
www.mirecc.org/product-frames.html
and includes scales that measure 16
competencies selected from a set of
37 competencies identified by a literature review and national consensus
process (18). The competencies
970

measured by the CAI can be found in
Table 2. These competencies were selected because the national consensus
panel viewed them as central to recovery-oriented care, not prevalent
among providers, and potentially
modifiable.
An overall competency score was
obtained by averaging the 16 scale
scores. The questionnaire also included items about job duties and seven
items from a scale that assesses attitudes toward recovery (35). In preparation for data analyses, all scales
were transformed to range from 0 to
1, with 1 indicating the highest competency.
Treatment processes were evaluated with semistructured interviews
with managers and clinicians at baseline and at the one-year follow-up. Interviews were conducted by one of
the authors and focused on rehabilitation, recovery-oriented services, and
PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES

mutual support groups. Questions addressed barriers to and facilitators of
service provision and organizational
change.
Data analysis
The effect of the intervention on clinicians’ competencies was evaluated
by comparing change over time between the intervention and control
groups. Effects were evaluated by using maximum-likelihood, mixedmodel general linear analyses of covariance. Separate analyses were
done for each competency by using
the intervention condition as the fixed
independent variable and controlling
for baseline score. To address possible nonindependence from clustering
within organizations, analyses included the five treatment organizations as
a random design factor. To evaluate
the possible confounding effects of
clinician type between the intervention and control groups, we used
analysis of covariance, coding the clinician variable as a dichotomy, contrasting clinician or therapist with residential staff or mental health worker.
We tested whether this covariate interacted with the intervention effects
for each competency and found that
none were significant. Therefore, we
analyzed each competency by using
simple analyses of covariance, evaluating the intervention effect while
statistically controlling for clinician
type.
When a significant effect was found
for a competency, a secondary analysis evaluated whether there was a
dose-response relationship. Analyses
examined whether competency
change was associated with the number of intervention components participated in by the clinician (zero to
six). Stepwise multiple regression was
performed with competency change
as the dependent variable, forcing
baseline score into the model in the
first step and then adding the participation score. Analyses were performed with SAS statistical software.
Not all of the participating clinicians had data at follow-up. To confirm results, we ran analyses on variables that showed significant intervention effects, using multiple imputation to replace missing data. Imputations were based on the full set of

♦ http://ps.psychiatryonline.org ♦ August 2005 Vol. 56 No. 8

baseline and one-year follow-up competency variables.
Data from the semistructured interviews were analyzed with the constant comparison method (36). This
method involved continually moving
between initial and later interviews,
identifying units of meaning, coding
the data, and interpreting the data.
First-level coding was completed by
observing similarities and differences
between data segments from the interviews. After these units of meaning
were identified, they were grouped
into categories. Interpreting the more
abstract meaning of the first-level categories yielded second-level coding,
which is presented in the Results section. Reliability was ensured by sampling individuals with a wide range of
employment positions and perspectives, collecting and analyzing data simultaneously with a “macro-micro”
perspective to move from single bits
of data to overarching themes and
back to the data to confirm emerging
concepts (37), and having an independent expert in mental health professional training and systems change
review coding and findings to determine dependability, credibility, and
degree of fit (38).

Results
Of 340 clinicians eligible for our
study, 269 (79 percent) chose to participate: 151 in the intervention group
and 118 in the control group. Participation rates did not differ significantly between intervention and control
groups (151 of 186 clinicians, or 81
percent, in the intervention group,
compared with 118 of 154 clinicians,
or 77 percent, in the control group).
As is often the case at agencies such
as these, clinician turnover was substantial. During the intervention, 59
clinicians at the Arizona sites (37 percent) and 15 clinicians at the Colorado sites (14 percent) left their
jobs. Because of this turnover, 195 of
269 participants (72 percent) completed the one-year follow-up. Clinicians in the intervention group were
somewhat more likely to complete
the one-year follow-up survey than
those in the comparison group (117 of
151 clinicians in the intervention
group, or 76 percent, compared with
78 of 118 clinicians in the control

At each site, a number of managers
and clinicians were selected to complete the semistructured interview. At
baseline, interviews were conducted
with two upper managers, six middle

Table 5, when the analyses adjusted
for clinician type, the overall pattern
of results was similar. The differences
were that scores on medication management, holistic approach, and natural supports no longer showed improvement that was significant at
p<.05. However, in within-group
analyses, the scores of the intervention group for these three scales improved significantly over time, whereas those of the control group did not
(Table 5). Analyses were repeated by
using imputed instead of missing
data, and the pattern of results was
the same.
Exposure to the intervention was
correlated with improvement in
teamwork (r=.28, p=.003), holistic
approach (r=.17, p=.06), education
about care (r=.22, p=.03), rehabilitation methods (r=.25, p=.007), natural
supports (r=.24, p=.02), and overall
competency (r=.21, p=.02). There
was no dose-response relationship for
medication management.
Preintervention interviews with
managers and clinicians revealed substantial variation in the organizations’
understanding and use of recoveryoriented services. Some staff recalled
trainings in daily living skills, and others talked about client-focused care.
Many mentioned support of vocational rehabilitation. Attitudes and behaviors that foster psychiatric rehabilitation and client-centered care were
not well understood. Staff conveyed
an interest in supporting client-run
activities but often did not know how
to follow through. Staff at most sites
reported that their organizations espoused a shift toward recovery-oriented services and that training toward this end would be beneficial.
At one year, interviews revealed
that intervention sites were providing
more recovery-oriented services than
control sites. At intervention sites, clinicians reported more support from
management for implementing new
rehabilitation services. They commonly stated that providing rehabilitation is hard work and takes a new
kind of thoughtfulness. One said, “We
thought we knew what we were doing, but it’s much more complicated
than we thought.” Many staff were relieved that a foundation for psychiatric rehabilitation is helping clients

take personal responsibility for their
lives and their treatment. One stated,
“Everything we do has to focus on the
small steps, the next thing we can
help each client do for himself or herself.” Staff at control sites said that
not much had changed. One clinician
stated, “We’re not doing rehabilitation, we’re just trying to keep things
under control.”
Before the intervention, few selfhelp groups existed. More often, naturally occurring, informal support
networks were described. For instance, some clients lived in the same

neighborhood and socialized together. At the one-year follow-up, staff at
all sites reported difficulties interesting clients in mutual support groups.
They reported that many clients
found mutual support groups cliquish
or uninteresting. However, intervention staff were more supportive of
mutual support and more determined
to find ways to support mutual support groups. Intervention staff reported an increased use of existing clientrun services.

Despite the challenges, eight new
consumer-run mutual support groups
were started during the study period,
all at intervention sites. In Arizona
four groups were started: two current
topics groups, a Double Trouble in
Recovery group, and a Wellness in
Numbers group. The format of the
current topics group was determined
by consumers at the site and focused
on news items. The groups existed for
three, seven, five, and nine months,
respectively. In Colorado, three
groups started: one Double Trouble
in Recovery group, one Wellness in
Numbers group, and one relaxation
group. The format of the relaxation
group was determined by consumers
and focused on choosing and playing
relaxation tapes. All support groups in
Colorado continued beyond the intervention year. As groups became established, they increased their efforts
to recruit new members and began to
provide transportation so that more
consumers could get involved.

Discussion
In this project, a one-year consumerled intervention led to the formation
of mutual support and improved clinicians’ competencies, which were
assessed with a research survey. The
greatest improvements were observed in clinicians’ competencies
that are critical for client-centered
care. In addition, clinicians at intervention sites stated that they were
providing more recovery-oriented
services. Changes in treatment provision must be interpreted with caution, because we did not quantify
service use. However, changes in
treatment process were consistent
with improvements seen in the structure of care. Although most competencies improved under the intervention, stigma worsened among clinicians in both the intervention and
control groups during the year. Clinicians may have been influenced by
several violent incidents committed
by individuals with mental illness that
received national attention at that
time.
Although the effectiveness of Staff
Supporting Skills for Self-Help needs
to be replicated, improvement in
competency is notable, because interventions targeting the organization of
973

care for people with severe and persistent mental illness have often failed
to generate change at the clinical level (3). Staff Supporting Skills for SelfHelp differs from most previous interventions in that it involves both the
clinician and the client, focuses on
client-centered care, and targets
competencies. This approach is consistent with organizational theory,
which suggests that resistance of staff
to change can be overcome by assigning value to staff characteristics that
are related to client outcomes (39).
Also, in this project an incentive for
organizations to change was provided
by ValueOptions, which managed
their funding and was supportive of
the project.
Interventions are easier to disseminate if they are acceptable, feasible,
and useful within the context of usual
care arrangements. The intervention
performed well in each of these domains. As expected, staff varied in the
extent to which they accepted the intervention and believed that clientcentered care is important. Staff participation was moderate. Resources
allocated for the intervention were
modest and consisted primarily of the
time of the intervention leaders and
of the clinicians who were released
from usual activities to participate in
intervention components. It may be
possible to strengthen provider
change by linking personnel practices
to possession of valued competencies.
Further benefit should also be possible by linking the client-centered focus with implementation of specific
evidence-based services, such as supported employment.
Certain limitations should be noted. First, we did not measure change
in the appropriateness of care or
client outcomes. Studying downstream effects on outcomes would require a much larger sample size. Also,
the generalizability of our findings is
limited by the number of sites. Because selection of intervention organizations was based in part on willingness to participate, findings could
have resulted from clinicians’ being
predisposed to the care model. However, this potential for bias is somewhat mitigated by the fact that any
baseline differences between competencies of clinicians in the control and
974

intervention groups were statistically
controlled. In addition, the positive
dose-response relationships demonstrate a role for exposure to the intervention. Finally, the CAI is a self-report measure; therefore, there could
be a discrepancy between clinicians’
responses and their actual level of
competencies. However, self-report
survey methods have been successfully used to assess competencies of
groups such as medical residents (40),
nurses (41), and social workers (42).
In all cases, surveys similar to the CAI
were reliable and valid and led to the
identification of educational priorities. Further research should evaluate
broader dissemination of Staff Supporting Skills for Self-Help and provide more information about links between changes in competencies and
service delivery.

Conclusions
The principle of client-centered care
is said to be vitally important in the
care of persons with mental illness.
Yet there have been few efforts to
make care more client centered. This
intervention is one of the first such efforts to be evaluated. Staff Supporting Skills for Self-Help is designed
and implemented by consumers. It is
feasible at busy clinics and has a positive effect on the structure of care,
particularly in domains supporting recovery. This study focused on
provider competencies that are critical to client-centered care, evaluated
them by using a validated survey
method, and found improvement in
multiple domains. Because there are
numerous barriers to improving the
process of care and outcomes for people with severe mental illness, adequate progress will require a number
of simultaneous approaches. Although having a competent workforce does not assure provision of appropriate care, it represents a critical
step forward. ♦
