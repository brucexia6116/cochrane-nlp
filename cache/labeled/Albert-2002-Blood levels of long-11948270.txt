ABSTRACT
Background Experimental data suggest that longchain n¡3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish
have antiarrhythmic properties, and a randomized trial
suggested that dietary supplements of n¡3 fatty acids
may reduce the risk of sudden death among survivors
of myocardial infarction. Whether long-chain n¡3 fatty acids are also associated with the risk of sudden
death in those without a history of cardiovascular disease is unknown.
Methods We conducted a prospective, nested case–
control analysis among apparently healthy men who
were followed for up to 17 years in the Physicians’
Health Study. The fatty-acid composition of previously
collected blood was analyzed by gas–liquid chromatography for 94 men in whom sudden death occurred
as the first manifestation of cardiovascular disease and
for 184 controls matched with them for age and smoking status.
Results Base-line blood levels of long-chain n¡3
fatty acids were inversely related to the risk of sudden
death both before adjustment for potential confounders (P for trend=0.004) and after such adjustment
(P for trend=0.007). As compared with men whose
blood levels of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids were in the
lowest quartile, the relative risk of sudden death was
significantly lower among men with levels in the third
quartile (adjusted relative risk, 0.28; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.87) and the fourth quartile
(adjusted relative risk, 0.19; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.71).
Conclusions The n¡3 fatty acids found in fish are
strongly associated with a reduced risk of sudden
death among men without evidence of prior cardiovascular disease. (N Engl J Med 2002;346:1113-8.)

E previously reported that fish consumption was associated with a reduced
risk of sudden death from cardiac causes, but not a reduced risk of myocardial infarction, in the Physicians’ Health Study.1 It is
hypothesized that the long-chain n¡3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish, primarily eicosapentaenoic
acid and docosahexaenoic acid, may be responsible for
this association. Experimental data from studies in animals and at the cellular level suggest that these n¡3

fatty acids have antiarrhythmic properties,2,3 and a recent randomized trial testing supplements of these
n¡3 fatty acids in survivors of myocardial infarction
found a statistically significant 45 percent reduction in
the risk of sudden death, with no effect on nonfatal
myocardial infarction.4 However, prospective data on
blood levels of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids and sudden
death from cardiac causes are sparse, and there have
been no randomized trials of the effects of long-chain
n¡3 fatty acids in the diet or as supplements among
persons without a history of cardiovascular disease,
who represent over half of all cases of sudden death
from cardiac causes.5
To address the hypothesis that the long-chain n¡3
fatty acids found in fish are associated with a reduced
risk of sudden death from cardiac causes in those without known cardiovascular disease, we performed a prospective, nested case–control analysis of the fatty-acid
composition of whole blood in men without a confirmed history of cardiovascular disease who were participants in the Physicians’ Health Study.
METHODS
Study Population and Collection of Whole-Blood Samples
The methods of the Physicians’ Health Study have been described
in detail elsewhere.6,7 Briefly, 22,071 male physicians, who were 40
to 84 years old in 1982 and had no history of myocardial infarction,
stroke, transient ischemic attacks, or cancer, were assigned at random according to a two-by-two factorial design to receive aspirin,
beta carotene, both active drugs, or both placebos. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the research protocol was
approved by the institutional review board at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. At base line, the physicians completed
questions on their health status and risk factors for cardiovascular
disease. Dietary intake of fish was ascertained at 12 months with
an abbreviated, semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire,8 as
described previously.1 Information on cardiovascular events was updated every six months for the first year and annually thereafter with
follow-up questionnaires.
Before randomization, which occurred between August 1982 and
December 1984, potential participants were asked to provide base-

line blood samples, which were collected in EDTA and processed
for long-term storage at ¡80°C. Of the randomized study participants, 14,916 (68 percent) provided base-line blood samples. More
than 70 percent of these specimens were received between September and November 1982.
Confirmation of End Points and Selection of Controls
The end point of sudden death from cardiac causes was ascertained by a two-step process. First, deaths from any cause were generally reported by postal authorities or next of kin, and an end-point
review committee confirmed deaths from cardiovascular causes by
examining medical records obtained from hospitals and attending
physicians. A participant’s next of kin was interviewed about the circumstances of the death if they were not adequately documented
in the medical record.
Second, to ascertain the specific end point of sudden death from
cardiac causes, two cardiologists who were unaware of the subject’s
exposure status reviewed medical records and reports from the next
of kin of all deaths from cardiovascular causes (excluding strokes).
In this second review, sudden death from cardiac causes was defined
as death within one hour after the onset of symptoms or a witnessed
cardiac arrest or abrupt collapse that occurred within one hour after the onset of symptoms and that resulted in death. For all these
deaths, no probable noncardiac cause was suggested by the history
or autopsy. To increase specificity for death from cardiac arrhythmia, we excluded any death for which there was evidence of collapse
of the circulation (hypotension, exacerbation of congestive heart failure, or altered mental status) before the disappearance of the pulse.9
Unwitnessed deaths with no information on timing but with an autopsy report consistent with death from cardiac arrhythmia (i.e.,
acute coronary thrombosis or severe coronary artery disease without myocardial necrosis or other pathological findings to explain
death) were considered possible sudden deaths from cardiac causes.
Analyses were performed both including and excluding these deaths,
with similar results.
Over the 17 years of study follow-up, 201 sudden deaths from
cardiac causes were documented; for 119 of these, an adequate baseline blood sample was available for analysis. Ninety-four of these
subjects had been free of confirmed cardiovascular disease before
death. Each of these subjects was matched with two control subjects, who had also provided an adequate base-line blood sample
and who were alive and remained free of confirmed cardiovascular
disease at the time of case ascertainment. A diagnosis of confirmed
cardiovascular disease required a report of angina with a positive
stress-test result or coronary angiography documenting clinically
significant coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction confirmed
according to World Health Organization criteria, or stroke confirmed by a typical neurologic deficit lasting longer than 24 hours.
Using a risk-set sampling method, we randomly selected controls
from among study participants who met the matching criteria for
age (within one year), smoking status (formerly, currently, or never), and length of time since randomization (in six-month intervals).
For four case subjects, only one adequate control could be found.
Laboratory Analysis
Whole blood collected and stored at base line was thawed. Although there are no data on their long-term storage in blood, longchain n¡3 fatty acids have been documented to have high reliability
coefficients (0.64 to 0.66) and minimal oxidation in serum samples
stored at ¡80°C for up to 12 years.10 The fatty acids from whole
blood were extracted11,12 and quantitated by gas–liquid chromatography on a fused silica capillary cis–trans column (SP2560, Supelco,
Bellefonte, Pa.). We identified the peak retention times from 47
peaks and the percentage of total fatty-acid peak area representing
95.2 percent of the total peak area by injecting known standards
(NuCheck Prep, Elysian, Minn.), with the use of ChemStation
A.08.03 software for analysis (Agilent Technologies). Blood spec-

imens were analyzed in groups of three blinded samples, with the
position of the case subject’s specimen varied at random within the
groups to reduce the possibility of systemic bias and to decrease variability between assays. Coefficients of variation for all fatty-acid peaks
were measured by analyzing quality-control samples (indistinguishable from other study samples) randomly distributed throughout
the study samples. The major peaks of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids
included docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n¡3), eicosapentaenoic acid
(C20:5n¡3), and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n¡3). The coefficients
of variation for these major long-chain n–3 fatty acids were 7.7,
13.7, and 9.2, respectively. These three peaks were summed for each
participant to arrive at the total long-chain n¡3 fatty acid level.
Statistical Analysis
For base-line risk factors, means or proportions were calculated
for men who died suddenly (case subjects) and controls. The significance of associations was tested with the chi-square statistic for categorical variables and with Student’s t-test for continuous variables.
Associations between base-line risk factors and levels of long-chain
n¡3 fatty acids, expressed as percentages of total fatty acids, were
tested with Student’s t-test. The Spearman rank-correlation coefficient was used to test the association between base-line levels of
long-chain n¡3 fatty acids and fish consumption, measured at 12
months.
Means (expressed as percentage of total fatty acids) for each fattyacid peak were calculated for case and control subjects, and the
significance of differences was tested by Student’s t-test for those
that were normally distributed and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for
those that were not normally distributed. To estimate the relative
risk of sudden death according to the blood level of long-chain n¡3
fatty acids, we first categorized each subject according to quartiles
determined by the distribution of fatty acid levels in the controls.
We then performed logistic-regression analysis, conditioned on the
matching variables of age and smoking. Adjusted estimates of risk
were obtained with multivariate models that also controlled for
body-mass index; presence or absence of a history of diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia; presence or absence of a parental
history of premature myocardial infarction; alcohol intake; frequency of physical activity; and random assignment to aspirin and beta
carotene or placebo. After the quartile analysis suggested a linear
relation, tests for trend were performed by entering a continuous
variable in the conditional-regression model.
In secondary analyses, to assess for confounding by other fatty
acids, each fatty-acid group (saturated, monounsaturated, n¡6 polyunsaturated, and trans unsaturated fatty acids) was entered separately according to quartile into the multivariate model, and the
change in the parameter estimate for the continuous value of longchain n–3 fatty acid was observed. If a change of more than 15 percent was noted, the fatty acid remained in this multivariate model.
All P values were two-tailed, and all confidence levels were computed at the 95 percent level.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the base-line characteristics of the 94
subjects in whom sudden death was the first manifestation of cardiovascular disease and the 184 matched
controls. The mean time from study enrollment to
sudden death was 8.7 years (range, 0.7 to 16.9). In this
sample, the men who died suddenly were significantly more likely to have a history of hypertension, significantly more likely to have a parental history of early
coronary artery disease (i.e., before 60 years of age),
and significantly less likely to have been randomly assigned to receive aspirin. The relation with alcohol intake was U-shaped: men who died suddenly were more

likely to drink less than once a week or daily, and less
likely to drink one to six drinks per week. Of the risk
factors listed in Table 1, significantly lower levels of
long-chain n¡3 fatty acids were found among current
smokers than among former smokers or those who
had never smoked (mean [±SD], 4.47±1.31 vs. 5.20±
1.30 percent of total fatty acids; P=0.002). In addition, the base-line blood level of long-chain n¡3 fatty
acids was significantly correlated with fish intake at 12
months (R2=0.24, P=0.001) (data not shown).
The base-line blood levels of each major fatty acid
among men who died suddenly and controls are
shown in Table 2. The mean level of total long-chain
n¡3 fatty acids was significantly lower among the men
who died suddenly than among the controls (4.82±
1.31 vs. 5.24±1.32 percent of total fatty acids, P=
0.01). In contrast, the levels of the other fatty acids, including the short-chain n¡3 polyunsaturated fatty acid
(a-linolenic acid), saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, n¡6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and
trans unsaturated fatty acids, did not differ significantly
between men who died suddenly and control subjects.
Table 3 shows the relation of base-line blood levels
of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids to the risk of sudden

death. The level of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids was significantly inversely related to the risk of sudden death
in both the analysis adjusted for age and smoking status (P for trend=0.004) and the multivariate analysis
(P for trend=0.007). As compared with the men with
levels of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids in the lowest quartile (mean, 3.58 percent of total fatty acids), those with
levels in the highest quartile (mean, 6.87 percent) had
a relative risk of sudden death of 0.19 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.71) after known confounders were controlled for (multivariate model 1). These
results were not materially affected when 15 possible sudden deaths were excluded from the analysis
(relative risk for highest vs. lowest quartile, 0.14;
95 percent confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.75; P for
trend=0.01).
Since the level of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids was
significantly associated with levels of other fatty acids
(inversely with saturated, trans unsaturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids and directly with n¡6 polyunsaturated fatty acids), each fatty-acid group was entered
in the multivariate model to evaluate the independent
association of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids with the risk
of sudden death. Adjustment for saturated and n¡6

polyunsaturated fatty acids did not appreciably alter
the association between long-chain n¡3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the risk of sudden death. Adjustment for monounsaturated and trans unsaturated fatty acids resulted in a further strengthening of
the relation (Table 3, multivariate model 2). With this
adjustment, the relative risk of sudden death among
men with levels of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids in the
highest quartile as compared with the lowest quartile
was 0.10 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.48;
P for trend=0.001).
DISCUSSION

In this prospective, nested case–control study of
healthy male physicians without evidence of cardiovascular disease at enrollment, the base-line blood level of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids was inversely associated with the subsequent risk of sudden death, even
after known confounders had been controlled for. The
association was linear, with a statistically significant inverse trend across quartiles of levels of long-chain
n¡3 fatty acids. As compared with men with levels
of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids in the lowest quartile,
those with levels in the highest quartile had an 81 percent lower risk of sudden death. This relation persisted when blood levels of other fatty-acid groups were
controlled for in the model. Therefore, the association
did not appear to depend on compensatory changes
in the levels of other fatty acids.
These prospective findings are remarkably similar
to those reported in a population-based case–control
study involving 82 cases of primary cardiac arrest.13
That study found a strong inverse association between
red-cell n–3 fatty-acid composition at the time of the
arrest and the risk of primary cardiac arrest among
subjects with no history of clinically recognized cardiac disease. Taken together, these data support the
hypothesis that long-chain n¡3 fatty acids are responsible for the observed inverse association between fish
consumption and sudden death.1,13 There was no evidence of a threshold effect for blood levels of longchain n¡3 fatty acids, although a threshold effect was
previously reported for fish intake in this cohort.1
Because the present study did not examine other
cardiovascular end points or death from other causes,
we cannot present direct data on the selectivity of the
association between long-chain n¡3 fatty acids and
sudden death. However, previous studies of this cohort found no association between plasma levels of
long-chain n¡3 fatty acids14 or fish intake1 and the
risk of myocardial infarction. In addition, a selective
beneficial effect on the risk of sudden death was found
in a randomized trial.4 In that trial, men with a history
of myocardial infarction who were assigned to a fishoil supplement had a statistically significant 45 percent
reduction in the risk of sudden death, which translat-

ed into an overall significant reduction in total mortality. However, there was no reduction in the risk of
nonfatal cardiovascular events or in other causes of
mortality.
The apparent beneficial effect on the risk of sudden
death from cardiac causes in observational studies and
randomized trials could be due in part to the antiarrhythmic effects of n¡3 fatty acids, as reported from
experimental models.3,15,16 Plausible mechanisms for
these antiarrhythmic effects include modulation of sodium, potassium, and L-type calcium channels 2,17,18;
inhibition of thromboxane production19,20; and beneficial effects on heart-rate variability.21,22 Other indirect effects of long-chain n¡3 fatty acids include lowering of the nonesterified fatty-acid concentration in
plasma and cell membranes. Nonesterified fatty acids
have multiple proarrhythmic properties and have recently been associated with an increased risk of sudden
death, but not of fatal myocardial infarction, among
men enrolled in the Paris Prospective Study I.23
The limitations of these data merit consideration.
First, our analyses are based on a single base-line measurement and therefore may not accurately reflect levels
of long-chain n–3 fatty acids over long periods. Furthermore, although the coefficients of variation were
low, misclassification due to laboratory error cannot be
ruled out. It is important to note, however, that neither of these sources of variability can account for the
strong inverse association we observed between longchain n¡3 fatty acid levels and sudden death, since
any random misclassification would bias results toward
the null hypothesis. The use of a single base-line measurement does, however, limit our ability to assess accurately the relation between the shorter-chain n¡3
fatty acid, a-linolenic acid, and sudden death, since this
fatty acid is largely metabolized,24 and if it is stored,
it is elongated to docosahexaenoic acid. Therefore,
blood levels of a-linolenic acid would be more dependent on what foods were eaten recently and less
likely to reflect average dietary intake.
The use of whole blood is a possible limitation, because it combines two different pools of long-chain
n¡3 fatty acids, the plasma and the stored red-cell
pools. Alternatively, this composite measure may be
viewed as a strength, since these pools have different
half-lives and provide complementary information.
Finally, as with any observational study, the inverse
association between blood levels of long-chain n¡3
fatty acids and sudden death could be due, at least in
part, to residual confounding by other dietary and lifestyle factors. However, control for major known confounders and other fatty-acid groups had little effect
on the estimates of relative risk.
In summary, taken together with previous data from
observational studies and randomized trials, these prospective data suggest that the long-chain n¡3 fatty ac-

ids found in fish may reduce the risk of sudden death
from cardiac causes, even among men without a history of cardiovascular disease. Because more than 50
percent of all sudden deaths from cardiac causes occur
in people with no history of cardiac disease,5 preventive efforts must address this segment of the population to have a substantial effect on the overall incidence
of sudden death from cardiac causes. If the observed
association is causal, increasing the intake of n¡3 fatty
acids by eating more fish or by taking supplements is
an intervention that could be applied to this segment
