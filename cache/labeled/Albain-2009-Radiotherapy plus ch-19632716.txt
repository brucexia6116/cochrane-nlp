Summary
Background Results from phase II studies in patients with stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer with ipsilateral
mediastinal nodal metastases (N2) have shown the feasibility of resection after concurrent chemotherapy and
radiotherapy with promising rates of survival. We therefore did this phase III trial to compare <tx>concurrent chemotherapy</tx>
and <tx>radiotherapy</tx> followed by resection with standard concurrent chemotherapy and deﬁnitive radiotherapy without
resection.

Lancet 2009; 374: 379–86

Methods Patients with stage T1-3pN2M0 non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to concurrent
induction chemotherapy (two cycles of cisplatin [50 mg/m² on days 1, 8, 29, and 36] and etoposide [50 mg/m² on
days 1–5 and 29–33]) plus radiotherapy (45 Gy) in multiple academic and community hospitals. If no progression,
patients in group 1 underwent resection and those in group 2 continued radiotherapy uninterrupted up to 61 Gy. Two
additional cycles of cisplatin and etoposide were given in both groups. The primary endpoint was overall survival
(OS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00002550.

Findings <n>202</n> patients (median age 59 years, range 31–77) were assigned to group 1 and 194 (61 years, 32–78) to
group 2. Median OS was 23·6 months (IQR 9·0–not reached) in group 1 versus 22·2 months (9·4–52·7) in group 2
(hazard ratio [HR] 0·87 [0·70–1·10]; p=0·24). Number of patients alive at 5 years was 37 (point estimate 27%) in
group 1 and 24 (point estimate 20%) in group 2 (odds ratio 0·63 [0·36–1·10]; p=0·10). With N0 status at thoracotomy,
the median OS was 34·4 months (IQR 15·7–not reached; 19 [point estimate 41%] patients alive at 5 years).
Progression-free survival (PFS) was better in group 1 than in group 2, median 12·8 months (5·3–42·2) vs 10·5 months
(4·8–20·6), HR 0·77 [0·62–0·96]; p=0·017); the number of patients without disease progression at 5 years was
32 (point estimate 22%) versus 13 (point estimate 11%), respectively. Neutropenia and oesophagitis were the main
grade 3 or 4 toxicities associated with <tx>chemotherapy plus radiotherapy</tx> in group 1 (77 [38%] and 20 [10%], respectively)
and group 2 (80 [41%] and 44 [23%], respectively). In group 1, 16 (8%) deaths were treatment related versus four (2%)
in group 2. In an exploratory analysis, OS was improved for patients who underwent lobectomy, but not
pneumonectomy, versus chemotherapy plus radiotherapy.
Interpretation Chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with or without resection (preferably lobectomy) are options for
patients with stage IIIA(N2) non-small-cell lung cancer.

Introduction
Patients with stage IIIA non-small-cell lung carcinoma
with clinically evident, ipsilateral mediastinal nodal
metastases (N2) had poor outcomes after treatment with
surgical resection or radiotherapy.1–4 Addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy signiﬁcantly improved survival
for patients in this disease-stage subset and is now
regarded as standard care.5–8 In subsequent phase III
trials, survival was much better with concurrent
chemotherapy and radiotherapy than with sequential
administration.9–11
Phase II pilot studies were done to test the role of
surgical resection after induction treatment with
<tx>chemotherapy</tx> alone or concurrent <tx>chemotherapy and
  radiotherapy</tx> to optimise local control after systemic
treatment. The results were controversial, with long-term
www.thelancet.com Vol 374 August 1, 2009

survival rates that were higher than expected.11–13 However,
substantial toxicity, postoperative morbidity, and mortality
were noted, and the ﬁndings of these studies were
criticised because the patients enrolled had heterogeneous
substages of disease and seemed unusually healthy
compared with the general population with stage III
disease.
On the basis of the ﬁndings of two previous phase II
studies done by the Southwest Oncology Group,14,15 we
designed a phase III trial (National Cancer Institute
numbers R9309, INT0139) in which patients with
pathologically documented stage IIIA(pN2) non-smallcell lung cancer were given <tx>concurrent chemotherapy
  plus radiotherapy</tx> followed by <tx>surgery</tx>, versus <tx>chemotherapy</tx> with <tx>deﬁnitive radiotherapy</tx> and without surgery.
The objectives were to assess whether resection resulted

in a signiﬁcant improvement in survival outcomes
compared with just chemotherapy plus radiotherapy;
examine the toxicity in each group; and report patterns of
local and distant disease recurrence.

Methods
Patients
The study was done at multiple academic and community
hospitals in the USA and Canada. The international
system was used to stage lung cancer,1 using a CT scan of
the chest, liver, and adrenal glands; bone scan; and CT or
MRI scan of the brain. Inclusion criteria were stage
IIIA(pN2) disease: T1, T2, or T3 primary non-small-cell
lung cancer with pathological proof of N2 involvement
(from biopsy samples of ipsilateral mediastinal nodes
that were visible on radiographs by any of several
protocol-speciﬁed standard procedures). If contralateral
mediastinal nodes that were larger than 1 cm were visible
on the CT scan, a biopsy was needed to exclude N3 (stage
IIIB) disease.
Patients were assessed by a thoracic surgeon, radiation
oncologist, and medical oncologist (each approved to
participate through a centralised questionnaire process)
to establish that N2 disease was present to the extent
that concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy was
regarded as the standard approach instead of deﬁnitive
resection, and that the cancer was potentially technically
resectable. Pulmonary function criteria were mandated
by the protocol (standard formula speciﬁed in protocol:

[FEV1] of at least 800 cm² on quantitative perfusion scan
if FEV1 overall was less than 2000 cm³). Pulmonary
medicine specialists were also consulted as needed to
conﬁrm pulmonary ﬁtness for a potential resection. The
Karnofsky performance status was 90 or 100; or, if 70 or
80, the albumin was at least 85% of the normal value
with less than 10% weight loss within the previous
3 months.
All patients provided written informed consent after
study approval by a local institutional review board.

Study design
We stratiﬁed eligible patients by primary T designation
(T1 vs T2 vs T3), Karnofsky performance status (90 or
100 vs 70 or 80), and contralateral mediastinal nodal
sampling (yes vs no). Patients were randomly assigned
in an unmasked manner to <tx>induction chemotherapy</tx>
plus radiotherapy followed by <tx>surgery</tx> (group 1), or the
same induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy with
completion of deﬁnitive-dose radiotherapy (group 2).
The random allocation schedule was generated by
computer at the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
statistical centre, whose personnel were not associated
with the institutions or investigators. The i<tx>nduction
  chemotherapy</tx> was two cycles of cisplatin (50 mg/m² on
days 1, 8, 29, and 36, intravenous infusions) and
etoposide (50 mg/m² on days 1–5 and 29–33, intravenous
infusions); and induction thoracic radiotherapy (45 Gy)
was administered beginning on day 1 in 1·8 Gy daily
fractions. We reassessed disease status with CT scan
plus repeat pulmonary function tests 2–4 weeks after
patients completed radiotherapy in group 1, and 7 days
before they completed induction chemotherapy plus
radiotherapy in group 2. If disease had not progressed
and the patient remained medically healthy, we did a
complete surgical resection (with protocol-speciﬁed
mediastinal lymph node sampling or dissection)
3–5 weeks after completion of radiotherapy in group 1,
or the radiation dose was continued to 61 Gy without
interruption in group 2. We gave patients two cycles of
consolidation chemotherapy (same doses and schedule
as during induction). Dose reduction guidelines were
speciﬁed in the protocol for chemotherapy plus
radiotherapy, with central quality control.
Patients were scheduled to have a chest CT scan
4–6 weeks after completion of the last <tx>chemotherapy</tx>
cycle. Patients were followed up every 2 months for 1 year,
every 3 months for 2 years, and then every
6 months indeﬁnitely. CT scans of the thorax and upper
abdomen, and MRI or CT scan of the brain were done at
12 months, 18 months, and 24 months, and every year
thereafter.

Statistical analysis
We used Zelen’s randomised permuted block within
strata to assign patients to a treatment group.16 Analyses
were by intention to treat, using only eligible patients as

p values are reported. Two interim analyses were
speciﬁed and done by the independent data safety
monitoring board after 33% and 67% of patients were
followed up for at least 2·5 years.
The target sample size was 612 (556 eligible) patients
to record 507 deaths to detect a 10% absolute
improvement in the surgical group, assuming 25%
2-year OS with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. The
size was recalculated after recommendation by the
Data Safety and Monitoring Committee, because of
slower accrual than projected and updated survival
rates from the two phase II trials that represented each
group.14,15 The revised sample size was 510 (484 eligible)
patients.
We analysed OS and PFS with the log-rank test, and
used the Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate
analyses.18 The adjusted α at the ﬁnal analysis was
0·0487. Only the unadjusted estimates and CIs are
reported here because the largest diﬀerence (between
unadjusted and adjusted) was 0·002 for hazard ratios
(HRs) and 0·04 for rates of OS and PFS. All ﬁgures
show Kaplan-Meier estimates.19 We used stepwise
selection in Cox modelling, including sex, weight loss
(<5 kg or >5 kg), number of positive nodal stations (1 or
2·3), T stage (T1 vs T2 vs T3), histology (non-squamous
vs squamous), age (<60 years vs >60 years), Karnofsky
performance status (90 or 100 vs 70 or 80), and lactate
dehydrogenase level (normal vs abnormal). We did
exploratory logistic regression for factors associated

An unplanned, exploratory OS analysis was added for
hypothesis generation, prompted by unexpectedly high
postoperative mortality rates. Patients in group 1 who
underwent pneumonectomy were matched 1:1 with
those in group 2 according to age (+/– 5 years), sex,
Karnofsky performance status (70 or 80, and 90 or 100),
382

Patient accrual period was from March, 1994, until the end
of November, 2001. Because of the extended accrual period
resulting in suﬃcient events, the Data Safety and
Monitoring Committee (with knowledge of the survival
curves in each group) recommended closure when
429 patients were randomly assigned. A PFS analysis and
initial OS have been previously presented, with a
subsequent update.20,21 Deﬁnitive estimates are now
available for all endpoints; median follow-up for all patients
was 22·5 months (range 0·9–125·1) and for those still alive
at the ﬁnal analysis was 69·3 months (6·2–125·1).
Figure 1 shows the trial proﬁle; 396 (92%) patients of
429 randomised were eligible for the analysis. The main
reasons for patient ineligibility were wrong stage or
incompletely staged disease during central review. The
rates of ineligibility and reasons did not diﬀer
substantially between the groups. Table 1 shows that
patient and tumour characteristics were well balanced
across the treatment groups. Of 155 resections, three
were wedge resections, 98 were lobectomies, and
54 were pneumonectomies (29 right lung; 25 left lung).
In group 2, 155 (80%) of 194 patients began consolidation
chemotherapy according to per protocol guidelines.
The amount of chemotherapy delivered per protocol
during induction chemotherapy plus radiotherapy did
not diﬀer between the groups (group 1, 191 [95%] of 201;
group 2, 177 [92%] of 193). 111 (55%) of 202 patients in
group 1 and 144 (74%) of 194 in group 2 completed
consolidation chemotherapy (p<0·0001; ﬁgure 1). We
administered radiotherapy per protocol or with acceptable
variation to 193 (96%) patients in group 1 and to 154
(79%) in group 2 (p<0·0001).
Table 2 summarises the toxicities. The most common
grade 3 or 4 toxicity was neutropenia in 77 (38%)
patients in group 1 and 80 (41%) in group 2. Grade 3
or 4 oesophagitis was reported in 20 (10%) patients in
group 1 and 44 (23%) in group 2 (p=0·0006).
Pneumonitis or other grade 3 or 4 respiratory
complications were reported in 18 (9%) patients in
group 1 and 28 (14%) in group 2 (p=0·116). Grade 3 or 4
nausea or emesis, or both, were reported in 29 (14%)

patients in group 1 and 26 (13%) in group 2 (p=0·885).
Grade 3 or above overall toxicity during induction
chemotherapy plus radiotherapy did not diﬀer between
the groups (data not shown), whereas the rate of
haematological toxicity was greater in group 2 during
consolidation chemotherapy (89 [point estimate 56%]
of 159 vs 44 [point estimate 36%] of 121).
No treatment-related deaths were reported during
induction treatment in either group. Subsequently,
16 (8%) patients died from causes not attributable to
cancer in group 1, including ten within 30 days of
thoracotomy. 14 of 16 patients died after pneumonectomy
and one after lobectomy, and one patient who did not
undergo thoracotomy also died. Causes of death were
acute respiratory distress syndrome (n=9), other
respiratory (n=4), cardiac (n=2), and haemorrhage (n=1).
Four (2%) patients in group 2 died from treatment-related
causes (non-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome respiratory [n=3] and other [n=1]) during or after consolidation
chemotherapy plus radiotherapy.
OS was not improved in group 1 versus group 2
(median 23·6 months [IQR 9·0–not reached] vs 22·2
months [9·7–52·7]; hazard ratio (HR) 0·87 [0·70–1·10],
p=0·24; ﬁgure 2B); 145 of 202 patients had died in group 1
versus 155 of 194 in group 2. More patients were alive
without progression in group 1 (43 [21%] of 202 vs 22 [11%]
of 194; p=0·008), but more individuals died without
progression in group 1 (36 [18%] of 202 vs 19 [10%] of 194;
p=0·02) than in group 2. By 5 years, an absolute diﬀerence
of 7% was noted in favour of the surgical group, with
37 (point estimate 27%) of 202 patients alive versus
24 (point estimate 20%) of 194 (odds ratio 0·63
[0·36–1·10]). No other factor was useful for prediction of
5-year survival with logistic regression.
Several independent predictors of outcome were noted
with the Cox OS model, including absence of major
weight loss (p=0·003), female sex (p=0·009), and one N2
nodal station that was positive at diagnosis versus more
(p=0·024). Treatment group, age, Karnofsky performance
status, T stage, lactate dehydrogenase, and histology were
not retained in the model. Because diﬀerent factors
determined whether a pneumonectomy or lobectomy
was chosen, a survival comparison of the cohorts given
these surgeries was not done.
PFS was longer in group 1 than in group 2 (median
12·8 months [IQR 5·3–42·2] vs 10·5 months [4·8–20·6];
HR 0·77 [95% CI 0·62–0·96], p=0·017; ﬁgure 2A); 159 of
202 patients had progressed or died in group 1 versus
172 of 194 in group 2. At 5 years, 32 (point estimate 22%)
of 202 patients in group 1 versus 13 (point estimate 11%)
of 194 in group 2 were free of disease.
The postinduction pathological ﬁndings in group 1 by
T and N category were recorded as proportions of
164 thoracotomies done and of total number (n=202) of
patients enrolled for each category. The categories were
29 T0N0 (18% thoracotomies and 14% patients); 31 T1N0

and 42%); and 3 unknown (2% and 2%). A pneumonectomy had been done for 13 (45%) of 29 T0N0 specimens. Figure 3 shows OS by postinduction pathological
stage according to N status. Median survival time and
5-year survival rates for patients with T (any) N0 were
34·4 months (IQR 15·7–not reached) and 19 (point
estimate 41%) of 76, respectively; T(any)N1-3 or unknown,
26·4 months (11·0–57·1) and 15 (point estimate 24%)
of 88, respectively; and no surgical resection, 7·9 months
(4·2–14·4) and 3 (point estimate 8%) of 38, respectively
(p<0·0001 for diﬀerence in survival between patients in
these three categories; ﬁgure 3). Patients in the T0N0
subset had a median survival of 39·8 months (16·4–not
reached), and at 5 years six (point estimate 42%) of 29
were alive. Postinduction pathological categories were
not known in group 2, thus comparisons between groups
were not feasible within TN subsets.
With the exception of fewer local-only relapses in
group 1 (21 [10%] of 202) than in group 2 (43 [22%] of
194), no diﬀerences were noted in sites of ﬁrst progression.
The sites of these relapses were the primary tumour sites
only (5 [2%] of 202 vs 28 [14%] of 194); hilar, mediastinal,
or supraclavicular nodes only (14 [7%] of 202 vs 6 [3%] of
194), and both (2 [1%] of 202 vs 9 [5%] of 194). The brain
was the only initial site of relapse in 23 (11%) of
202 patients in group 1 versus 29 (15%) of 194 in group 2.
Rates of recurrence at other distant sites were 75 (37%) of
202 versus 81 (42%) of 194, respectively.

Figure 4: Overall survival of a subset of patients from the intention-to-treat population given lobectomy (A)
or pneumonectomy (B) in group 1 versus matched cohorts in group 2
Slash marks represent censored results. CT/RT/S=chemotherapy plus radiotherapy followed by surgery (group 1,
n=202). CT/RT=chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (group 2, n=194).

The OS matching analysis for four prestudy factors for
group 1 against group 2 subsets was feasible for 90 of
98 lobectomies and 51 of 54 pneumonectomies. Rate of
OS was improved in the surgical group if a lobectomy
was done compared with the rate in the matched
chemotherapy plus radiotherapy group (ﬁgure 4A).
Median survival time was 33·6 months (IQR 15·6–not
384

OS was not signiﬁcantly improved, even though PFS
was, in patients who underwent trimodality treatment—ie,
concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by
surgical resection—compared with those given
concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy without
surgery. Rates of 5-year OS were non-signiﬁcantly
improved after trimodality treatment. Reasons for the
absence of OS beneﬁt might include inadequate power
and reduced delivery of cycles 3 and 4 of chemotherapy
in the surgical group. However, whether the additional
chemotherapy had any eﬀect in the non-surgical setting
is not known.
Another reason for the absence of beneﬁt with surgery
might largely relate to the high death rate after pneumonectomy, mainly attributable to acute respiratory distress
syndrome and other respiratory causes. On the basis of
this ﬁnding, we did an exploratory matching analysis that
led us to the hypothesis that trimodality treatment could
be beneﬁcial if a complete resection with lobectomy can
be done after chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, or if
mortality from pneumonectomy can be avoided. This
type of analysis has limitations because of the possibility
of other diﬀerences that were not noted when criteria
were matched, so it should not be used as the only basis
to select treatment. Also, the necessity for pneumonectomy
in many patients was probably related to other adverse
prognostic factors. 45% of pT0N0 specimens were
resected with pneumonectomy, showing that perhaps a
large proportion underwent extensive surgery
unnecessarily. Thus, this exploratory analysis could be
useful in decision making to ensure caution when a
trimodality prescription with pneumonectomy is
considered.
Both treatment regimens resulted in median and 5-year
survival rates that were better than expected on the basis
of data from phase II studies in patients with
stage IIIA(N2) non-small-cell lung cancer.11,12 The patients
enrolled in our trial with mediastinal nodal (pN2)
involvement were judged to be ﬁt for a rigorous treatment
regimen and had disease for which chemoradiotherapy
alone was deemed the standard therapy, yet was
technically resectable. However, this population stands
in contrast with other phase III trials in patients with

pN2 disease. The patients who were included in the
randomised trials12,13,22–24 in which induction chemotherapy was followed by surgery versus a surgery-only
control group had less extensive N2 disease than those
included in our study.
Although the European Organisation for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) did a phase III trial25
in which patients with stage IIIA(N2) non-small-cell
lung cancer were randomly assigned to surgery or
radiotherapy after response to induction chemotherapy,
the study diﬀered from ours in several ways. The
EORTC control group of chemotherapy followed by
radiotherapy is not regarded as standard treatment,9–11
and the outcome of all the patients is not known because
only the responding patients were randomly assigned to
treatment unlike in our trial. Similar to our ﬁndings,
accrual in the EORTC study was protracted, and no OS
beneﬁt was noted. The median and 5-year survival rates
in both groups of the EORTC study were worse than
those in our study, although this diﬀerence could be
explained partly by the two trials having diﬀerent entry
criteria.
Induction chemotherapy plus radiotherapy were well
tolerated by patients in both groups in our study, with
excellent treatment compliance. Treatment-related
mortality attributable to respiratory causes was worse in
the surgical group, and fewer patients could complete
consolidation chemotherapy after surgery than in the
non-surgery group. However, patients in the concurrent
chemotherapy and radiotherapy group had an increased
rate of severe oesophagitis and other toxicities during
consolidation chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and were
less likely to complete the prescribed radiotherapy than
were those given surgery.
With the long accrual period needed to complete trials
that address whether the inclusion of surgery versus a
non-surgical approach is beneﬁcial, a prospective trial is
unlikely to be done to validate the hypothesis generated
as a result of our exploratory analysis (ie, trimodality
approaches are better than bimodality approaches if
lobectomies can be done). Thus, medically healthy
patients with stage IIIA(N2) non-small-cell lung cancer
should be assessed by a team skilled in multimodality
treatment, and treatment options can be considered
during assessment. On the basis of the ﬁndings of our
study, patients should be counselled about the risks and
potential beneﬁts of deﬁnitive chemotherapy plus
radiotherapy with and without a surgical resection
(preferably by lobectomy).
