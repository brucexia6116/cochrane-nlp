OMOCYSTEINE LEVELS HAVE

been directly associated with
cardiovascular risk in observational studies1; and daily
supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, or a combination
have been shown to reduce homocysteine levels to varying degrees in intervention studies. 2 Based on these
data, several randomized trials were
designed to test the hypothesis that
supplementation with folic acid or B vitamins or both would prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, published trials on patients with preexisting
vascular disease have not demonstrated a benefit of folic acid or B vitamins on CVD risk.3 Participants in
observational studies were followed up
for longer durations then participants
in randomized trials1; therefore, it is
plausible that homocysteine lowering
may have had a greater effect if participants were treated and observed
for longer periods of time. Metaanalyses of randomized trials sugFor editorial comment see p 2086.

Context Recent randomized trials among patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) have failed to support benefits of B-vitamin supplementation on cardiovascular risk. Observational data suggest benefits may be greater among women, yet
women have been underrepresented in published randomized trials.
Objective To test whether a combination of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12
lowers risk of CVD among high-risk women with and without CVD.
Design, Setting, and Participants Within an ongoing randomized trial of antioxidant vitamins, <n>5442</n> women who were US health professionals aged 42 years or
older, with either a history of CVD or 3 or more coronary risk factors, were enrolled in
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to receive a combination pill containing folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 or a matching placebo, and were treated
for 7.3 years from April 1998 through July 2005.
Intervention Daily intake of a combination pill of 2.5 mg of folic acid, 50 mg of
vitamin B6, and 1 mg of vitamin B12.
Main Outcome Measures A composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke,
coronary revascularization, or CVD mortality.
Results Compared with placebo, a total of 796 women experienced a confirmed CVD
event (406 in the active group and 390 in the placebo group). Patients receiving active vitamin treatment had similar risk for the composite CVD primary end point (226.9/10 000
person-years vs 219.2/10 000 person-years for the active vs placebo group; relative risk
[RR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.19; P=.65), as well as for the secondary
outcomes including myocardial infarction (34.5/10 000 person-years vs 39.5/10 000 personyears; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.63-1.22; P=.42), stroke (41.9/10 000 person-years vs 36.8/
10 000 person-years; RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.82-1.57; P=.44), and CVD mortality (50.3/10 000
person-years vs 49.6/10 000 person-years; RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.76-1.35; P=.93). In a blood
substudy, geometric mean plasma homocysteine level was decreased by 18.5% (95% CI,
12.5%-24.1%; PϽ.001) in the active group (n=150) over that observed in the placebo
group (n=150), for a difference of 2.27 µmol/L (95% CI, 1.54-2.96 µmol/L).
Conclusion After 7.3 years of treatment and follow-up, a combination pill of folic
acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 did not reduce a combined end point of total cardiovascular events among high-risk women, despite significant homocysteine lowering.

EFFECT OF FOLIC ACID AND B VITAMINS ON RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

gest that benefits may be greater with
longer treatment durations,4 but the majority of published trials have 2 years
or less of follow-up,3 with only 1 trial
having 5 years of follow-up.5
Women have been underrepresented both in observational studies and
in randomized trials of homocysteine
lowering, and limited data from metaanalyses of observational studies suggest that women may benefit from homocysteine lowering to a greater extent.
In the most recent meta-analysis of
these observational studies, a 25%lower homocysteine level was associated with a 32% (95% confidence in-

terval [CI], 15%-45%) lower risk of
coronary heart disease in women as
compared with a 15% lower risk (95%
CI, 8%-21%) in men.1 Although women
have been included in meta-analyses of
randomized trials,3,6 the relative risks
(RRs) for women have not been separately estimated. Given the paucity of
data on women and the known influences of estrogen on homocysteine levels,7,8 adequately powered randomized trials of homocysteine lowering in
women are still needed.9
The present study, the Women’s Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study (WAFACS), tested whether

a combination of folic acid, vitamin B6,
and vitamin B12 would reduce total cardiovascular events among women at
high risk for the development of CVD
over 7.3 years of follow-up.
METHODS
Study Design

WAFACS was a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial that
evaluated whether a combination pill
of folic acid (2.5 mg/d), vitamin B6
(50 mg/d), and vitamin B12 (1 mg/d)
reduces the risk of important vascular events among high-risk women
with either a history of CVD or at
least 3 cardiovascular risk factors.
The WAFACS trial began in 1998,
when the folic acid, vitamin B6, and
vitamin B12 component was added to
the Women’s Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study (WACS), an ongoing
2 ϫ 2 ϫ 2 factorial trial of 3 antioxidant vitamins (C, E, and beta carotene), which expanded it to a
4-group factorial trial. The factorial
design allowed an examination not
only of the main effects of each agent
but also of potential interactions
between agents. Interactions between
antioxidant vitamins and folic acid
were plausible because homocysteine
lowering might have antioxidant
effects.10 Details of the overall trial
design11 and the results for the antioxidant group have been reported
previously. 12 This report describes
the CVD results of the folic acid,
vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 combination pill treatment group (FIGURE 1).
The study was sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.
The study vitamins and matching placebo were provided by BASF Corporation, Mount Olive, New Jersey. The trial
was approved by the institutional review board of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts,
and all patients provided written informed consent. An external independent data and safety monitoring board
monitored the safety of the participants and the overall quality and scientific integrity of the study.

EFFECT OF FOLIC ACID AND B VITAMINS ON RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS
Study Population

In the WACS parent trial, 8171 female
health professionals throughout the
United States were randomized in a
2ϫ2ϫ2 factorial design between June
1995 and October 1996 to receive vitamin C (500 mg/d), vitamin E (600 IU
every other day), and beta carotene (50
mg every other day) vs respective
matching placebos, yielding 8 treatment groups. Of these women, 5922
(72.5%) returned a blood sample at the
beginning of the trial, prior to the initiation of folic acid fortification; and
98.8% completed a semiquantitative
food-frequency questionnaire, which
was used to assess baseline dietary intake including folate.
Women were eligible for WACS if
they were aged 40 years or older, postmenopausal or had no intention of becoming pregnant, and had a reported
history of CVD or had at least 3 cardiac risk factors. CVD was defined as
a reported history of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, angina pectoris, or transient ischemic attack.
Qualifying cardiac risk factors were diagnosed hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, parental history of premature MI (ie, younger than
60 years), obesity (body mass index
Ն30 kg [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared]), and current cigarette use.12
Women were excluded if they had a history of cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) within the past 10
years, any serious non-CVD illness, or
were currently using warfarin or other
anticoagulants.
To be eligible for the folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 component,
potential participants in the ongoing
8-group trial had to be additionally willing to forgo individual supplements of
folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12
at levels beyond the US recommended
daily allowance (RDA) of 400 µg of folic acid, 2 mg of vitamin B6, or 6 µg of
vitamin B12 during the trial.2 Multivitamin use at or below these RDA levels was allowed. In April 1998, 5442 of
these women were additionally ran-

domized to receive a combination pill
containing 2.5 mg of folic acid, 50 mg
of vitamin B6, and 1 mg of vitamin B12
(active treatment) or a matching placebo daily, thus creating a total of 16
distinct treatment groups. All study investigators, personnel, and participants were unaware of the participants’ treatment assignments.
Follow-up Procedures

Following randomization and annually thereafter, participants were mailed
monthly calendar packs containing active agents or placebos. The participants were followed up annually with
questionnaires on adherence, use of
nonstudy supplements, and occurrence of major illnesses or adverse
events. Written permission for medical records was sought from participants who reported cardiovascular end
points or from the next of kin in case
of death. Death certificates were also obtained. An end points committee of
physicians who were blinded to randomized treatment assignment adjudicated all primary and secondary cardiovascular outcome events.
Study medications and end point ascertainment were continued in a
blinded fashion until the scheduled end
of the trial, July 31, 2005. Follow-up
and validation of reported end points
were completed in July 2006 for a follow-up duration of 7.3 years. At the
scheduled end of the trial on July 31,
2005, morbidity and mortality follow-up was 92.6% complete. If counted
in terms of person-time, mortality and
morbidity information was complete for
98.9% and 98.0% of person-years of follow-up, respectively.
Blood Substudy

Women in WAFACS who provided a
baseline blood sample in 1996, prior to
the initiation of background dietary folic acid fortification in the US food supply in 1998, were eligible for this preplanned substudy. From the 2596
eligible participants, 300 (150 in the active treatment and 150 in the placebo
group) provided a blood sample at the
end of randomized treatment. These

women were randomly selected from
participants who were adherent with
study medications. Plasma levels of folate (chemiluminescence method using
the 2010 Elecsys autoimmunoanalyzer, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and homocysteine (enzymatic assay using the Hitachi 917
analyzer, Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland) were measured in baseline and follow-up samples in a blinded
fashion in the same analytical run.
Study Outcomes

The primary outcome was a combined
end point of cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality, which included incident MI, stroke, coronary revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary
intervention), and cardiovascular mortality. The individual components of
total MI, total stroke, and total coronary heart disease events (MI, coronary revascularization, and death from
coronary heart disease) were prespecified secondary end points.
An MI was confirmed if symptoms
met World Health Organization criteria and if the event was associated with
either diagnostic electrocardiogram
changes or elevated cardiac enzymes.
Coronary revascularization was confirmed by medical record review. Confirmed stroke was defined as a new neurologic deficit of sudden onset that
persisted for more than 24 hours or until death within 24 hours. Clinical information, computed tomographic
scans, and magnetic resonance images
were used to distinguish hemorrhagic
from ischemic events. Coronary revascularization was confirmed if a coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention was
documented in the medical record.
Death due to cardiovascular cause was
confirmed by examination of autopsy
reports, death certificates, medical records, and information obtained from the
next of kin or other family members.
Death from any cause was confirmed
by the end points committee on the basis of a death certificate. Only confirmed end points were included in

these analyses, except for total mortality, which included an additional 43 reported deaths.
Power Calculations

Power calculations were performed
under the assumption that all 4
agents would have beneficial effects
on CVD, which would be additive
(on the log scale) when used in combination. This method affects the
power calculations by reducing the
incidence in all exposed groups and
provides a conservative estimate of
the study’s power to detect the effects
of each agent. We assumed additive

10% risk reductions for each of the
antioxidant vitamins and the folic
acid, vitamin B 6 , and vitamin B 12
combination pill. It was estimated
that the 5442 women who were randomized would provide 82% power
to detect an observed 20% reduction
in the primary end point.
Statistical Analysis

Baseline characteristics were compared by randomized groups using t
tests, ␹2 tests for proportions, and tests
for trend for ordinal categories. Primary analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis, including all 2721

randomized participants in each treatment group, as randomized. For both
the primary and secondary analyses,
person-time was calculated until the
first confirmed end point specified by
the analysis or to the end of the trial if
no end point occurred. Kaplan-Meier
curves were used to estimate cumulative incidence over time by randomized treatment group, and the logrank test was used to compare survival
curves. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate RRs expressed as hazard ratios and 95% CIs,
after adjustment for age and other randomized treatment assignments (vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta carotene).
The proportionality assumption was
tested using an interaction term for
treatment with log time, and was met
for each of the primary and secondary
analyses. To examine the effect of nonadherence, a post hoc sensitivity analysis censored participants when they
stopped taking at least two-thirds of
their study medications, reported taking outside supplements, or were missing adherence information.
Prespecified subgroup analyses according to antioxidant treatment assignment(s), presence or absence of
prior CVD, dietary folic acid intake,
smoking, diabetes, aspirin, hormone
therapy, and multivitamin use were performed using stratified Cox proportional hazards models. These analyses
used baseline exposure assessments and
were restricted to participants with nonmissing subgroup data at baseline. Additional exploratory subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the
consistency of the results. Tests for
effect modification by subgroup used
interaction terms between subgroup indicators and randomized assignment,
with a test for trend for ordinal subgroup categories. The raw distributions and median values of plasma homocysteine and folate levels in the
blood substudy were compared using
the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum
test. For homocysteine, geometric
means were compared after natural
logarithmic transformation to compare differences between treatment

Adherence and Adverse Events

Adherence was assessed through selfreport on annual study questionnaires
and was defined as taking at least twothirds of the study pills. Average adherence over the course of follow-up
was approximately 83% for active and
placebo agents with no significant difference between active and placebo
groups. Use of open-label folic acid
supplements, vitamin B6, or vitamin B12
supplements containing more than the
RDA for at least 4 days per month
ranged from 2% to 11% in the active
group to 2% to 13% in the placebo
group over the course of the study.
There were no serious adverse events
reported that were conclusively related to study interventions.

Cumulative Incidence

In April 1998, 2721 female health professionals participating in the WACS
trial were randomly assigned to active
treatment with folic acid, vitamin B6,
and vitamin B12 and 2721 participants
were assigned to placebo. Baseline characteristics at the time of randomization in 1998 and responses to the dietary questionnaire administered prior
to randomization in 1996 are displayed in TABLE 1. The mean age of the
population was 62.8 years and 64.2%
of women had a history of CVD. There
were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics or in
dietary intake of study vitamins between the randomized groups (Table 1).
The median daily dietary intake of folic acid including supplements was 432
µg, of which approximately 15% (63
µg) was estimated to be derived from
dietary intake of folic acid–fortified
grains. The use of permitted multivitamins with less than the RDA of folic
acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 at least
4 days per month ranged from 19% at
the beginning to 31% at the end of the
trial.

WAFACS indicates Women’s Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study. Major cardiovascular disease
denotes myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death.

Primary Analysis

During the 7.3 years of follow-up, 796
participants (14.6%) experienced a confirmed CVD event included in the primary end point, with some individuals
experiencing more than 1 event. Overall, 139 MIs, 148 strokes, 508 coronary
revascularization procedures, and 190
cardiovascular deaths occurred in the
population over the course of the study.
There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of the primary combined end point in the active vs placebo treatment groups at any time
during study follow-up (FIGURE 2). A
total of 406 women (14.9%) in the active treatment group and 390 (14.3%)
in the placebo group experienced at
least 1 cardiovascular event included in
the primary end point (226.9/10 000
person-years vs 219.2/10 000 personyears). This corresponded to an overall RR of 1.03 (95% CI, 0.90-1.19;
P=.65) after controlling for age and antioxidant treatment assignment
(TABLE 2). There remained no evidence for a treatment effect in sensitivity analysis censoring at nonadherence (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90-1.23;
P = .53) or if coronary revascularization procedures were excluded from the

primary end point (RR, 0.96; 95% CI,
0.80-1.17; P=.72).
Secondary and Other Outcomes

Among the prespecified secondary
cardiovascular outcomes, total coronary heart disease events occurred in
283 participants (156.5/10 000 person-years) in the active treatment
group and in 280 participants (155.8/
10 000 person-years) in the placebo
group (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.85-1.18;
P = .96; Table 2). When analyzed
separately, there were no significant
differences for each of the components of the primary outcome including MI (34.5/10 000 person-years vs
39.5/10 000 person-years; RR, 0.87;
95% CI, 0.63-1.22; P = .42), stroke
(41.9/10 000 person-years vs 36.8/
10 000 person-years; RR, 1.14; 95%
CI, 0.82-1.57; P = .44), and CVD
mortality (50.3/10 000 person-years
vs 49.6/10 000 person-years; RR,
1.01; 95% CI, 0.76-1.35; P = .93)
between the active treatment and
placebo groups. Also, the risk of
death from any cause was similar
between the active and placebo treatment groups (RR, 0.97; 95% CI,
0.81-1.15; P =.73).

E, vitamin C, and beta carotene.

b The primary outcome is defined as a composite end point comprising the first of any of these events: nonfatal myocardial

infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention), and cardiovascular mortality.

c Stroke type was unknown for 1 woman in the placebo group.
d Composite end point comprised the first coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention.
e Includes all incident coronary artery bypass grafting operations and percutaneous coronary intervention, respectively.
f Composite end point comprised the first of any of these events: nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization

procedures (coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention), and coronary heart disease death.

Subgroup Analyses

There were no significant treatment effects with respect to the primary outcome in any of the prespecified or
exploratory subgroups evaluated
(TABLE 3). Of particular interest, there
was a similar lack of benefit among participants without prior CVD as compared with those with prior CVD
(P=.93 for interaction), although the
trial was not powered to detect a specific benefit in this subgroup. Also, there
was no evidence that either dietary folate intake or multivitamin use modified the treatment effect, although
power was limited for these subgroups as well. The test for interaction was significant for treatment with
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (P=.03); however, this was not a
prespecified subgroup analysis.
With respect to the antioxidant vitamins, there was evidence for an interaction between randomized treatment assignment to vitamin C and the
combination therapy with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 on the pri2032

mary end point (Table 3). As compared with those randomized to both
placebos, RR for folic acid was lower
among those receiving placebo vs active vitamin C (P = .03 for interaction). There were no other significant
2-way or 3-way interactions among the
agents for the primary end point.
Effect of Supplementation
vs Fortification on Folate
and Homocysteine Levels

The 300 participants in the blood substudy were similar with respect to all the
clinical characteristics outlined in
Table 1, except that smokers (8.0% in the
blood group vs 12.1% in the nonblood
group; P=.003) and participants with a
history of diabetes (16.7% in the blood
group vs 21.3% in the nonblood group;
P=.06) were underrepresented among
the adherent participants in the blood
substudy. The distributions of baseline
and follow-up folate and homocysteine
levels among 150 participants in the placebo group and 150 participants in the
active group are displayed

in TABLE 4. Prior to the initiation of fortification and randomization, median folate levels were similar in the active treatment group (8.9 ng/mL; interquartile
range, 6.0-13.4 ng/mL) and the placebo
group (8.8 ng/mL; interquartile range,
6.4-12.8 ng/mL; P=.94), with 34% of the
study population having levels considered inadequate (Ͻ7 ng/mL). Median
plasma homocysteine levels were also
similar at baseline in the active treatment group (12.1 µmol/L; interquartile
range, 10.2-15.0 µmol/L) as compared
to the placebo group (12.5 µmol/L; interquartile range, 9.6-15.5 µmol/L;
P=.96), with 27.7% of the study population having a level greater than 15.0
µmol/L; Table 4).
At the end of study follow-up, the
median folate level increased significantly in the placebo group to 15.4
ng/mL (interquartile range, 11.5-22.6
ng/mL; P Ͻ .001); however, the relative increase in folate level was greater
in the active treatment group, in which
49.3% of participants had a folate level
greater than 40 ng/mL (the upper limit
of the assay) as compared to 4.7% in the
placebo group (Table 4). Despite significant increases in folate levels among
the placebo group, there was no apparent reduction in homocysteine levels at
the end of the study as compared with
participants measured at the beginning of the study in the placebo group
(median = 11.8 µmol/L; interquartile
range, 9.8-14.9 µmol/L; P=.99). In comparison, homocysteine levels were significantly reduced in the active treatment group (median level, 9.8 µmol/L;
interquartile range, 7.9-12.4 µmol/L;
P = .001), and the number of participants with significantly elevated homocysteine levels of greater than 15
µmol/L was reduced to 10%.
In order to directly compare the degree of additional homocysteine lowering observed in the active over the placebo group, we computed the difference
between treatment groups in the change
in the natural logarithm of homocysteine level from baseline to follow-up,
adjusting for baseline levels. The geometric mean homocysteine level was
decreased by 18.5% (95% CI, 12.5%-

over that observed in the placebo group
for a difference of 2.27 µmol/L (95% CI,
1.54 -2.96) from the placebo geometric mean homocysteine level of 12.28
µmol/L.

COMMENT

In this large-scale, placebo-controlled,
randomized trial among high-risk
women participants, we found no overall effects of a combination of folic acid,
vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 on the pri-

mary outcome of total CVD events over
the largest number of person-years and
the longest follow-up period reported to
our knowledge (7.3 years). In subgroup analyses, there was no heterogeneity of treatment effect among those

above or below the median of folate intake and among women with or without prior vascular disease. A possible
interaction with randomized vitamin C
and with nonrandomized angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor treatment on the primary outcome was observed; however, due to the large
number of comparisons, these results
could have been due to chance.
These null results for women are consistent with those previously reported
in randomized trials composed primar2034

ily of men with preexisting vascular disease.3 In the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Trial (HOPE) 2,5 the
same regimen of folic acid, vitamin B6,
and vitamin B12 failed to significantly
lower the risk of a combined outcome
of death from cardiovascular causes, MI,
and stroke among 5522 patients with
prior vascular disease over an average
of 5 years. Although there was a significant reduction in the secondary end
point of stroke in this trial (RR, 0.75;
95% CI, 0.59-0.97), a reduction in

stroke was not found with a similar
B-vitamin regimen in the Vitamins
Intervention for Stroke Prevention
(VISP) trial,13 in which stroke was the
primary end point. The HOPE-2 trial
also reported an increased risk of
hospitalization for unstable angina
(RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04-1.49) among
participants randomized to active
treatment.
In the Norwegian Vitamin (NORVIT)
Trial,14 a 2ϫ2 factorial trial of vitamin
B6 and a combination pill of folic acid
and vitamin B12 among recent post MI
patients, a marginally significant 22%
(95% CI, 0%-50%; P = .05) increased
risk of recurrent MI, stroke, and sudden death was found among participants assigned to the combination of
folic acid, B12 and vitamin B6 over a
median follow-up of 40 months. Smaller
studies among patients postcoronary
intervention have found both decreased15 and increased16 rates of restenosis among patients treated with
B-vitamin regimens. In the present
study, we found no evidence for a benefit on stroke or any evidence for harm
regarding the primary composite end
point or any of the individual secondary end points including coronary revascularization.

EFFECT OF FOLIC ACID AND B VITAMINS ON RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS

Concerns have been raised regarding the power of this trial and other current trials to adequately test the homocysteine hypothesis17,18; especially in
countries where folic acid fortification of the food supply has taken
place. 19 Observational studies suggested that fortification of grain products with 140 µg of folic acid per 100
g, which began in 1996 and became
mandatory in the United States and
Canada by 1998, significantly reduced mean plasma homocysteine concentrations among middle-aged individuals, and decreased the prevalence
of high homocysteine levels (Ͼ13
µmol/L) from 29.8% to 18.7%.20 Based
on these data, it has been estimated that
additional B-vitamin supplementation in such a fortified population
would only lower homocysteine levels by about 10%.21 In the present trial,
a greater but still somewhat modest
lowering of homocysteine (18.5% reduction) was observed. Although almost complete elimination of low folate concentrations was observed (Ͻ7
ng/mL) in the placebo group after fortification, there was no apparent reduction over time on homocysteine concentrations or on the prevalence of
elevated homocysteine levels (Ն15
µmol/L) in this population. Although
homocysteine levels were unchanged in
the placebo group, folic acid fortification likely prevented further elevations in homocysteine levels that would
have otherwise taken place due to the
aging of the population.
Initially, epidemiologic studies,
which were primarily retrospective and
cross-sectional, suggested that reducing plasma homocysteine by 5 µmol/L
would decrease vascular risk by onethird.22 However, a more recent metaanalysis of prospective observational
studies suggested that risk reductions
associated with homocysteine lowering would be much more modest.1 In
these studies, a 25%-lower homocysteine level, approximately 3 µmol/L, was
associated with 11% reduction in coronary heart disease risk and a 19% lower
stroke risk.1 The expected reductions
in cardiovascular events may have been

even lower in this trial where the reduction in homocysteine levels was only
18.5% (2.3 µmol/L) among adherent
patients. Although this trial was not initially powered to detect such modest reductions in cardiovascular events, the
95% CIs for the primary end point excludes with reasonable certainty reductions as low as 10% in the combined end
point of total cardiovascular events.
However, such modest plausible reductions in the individual secondary end
points of stroke, MI, and cardiovascular death cannot be excluded even in a
trial of this size.
There are several caveats and/or limitations to this study, which warrant
consideration. First, the study was conducted in a population of health professionals, who were at a relatively low
risk of folate deficiency. These participants were allowed to take the RDA of
folic acid and B-vitamins and were also
exposed to folic acid–fortified grain
products during the course of the trial.
Although the blood study suggests that
a significant proportion of the participants were folate deficient at the beginning of the trial, this was virtually
eliminated over the course of study.
Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that this same regimen may have
resulted in an even greater reduction in
homocysteine levels in a more folatedeficient population, which might have
translated into an observable benefit on
cardiovascular events. Alternatively, the
optimal dose of these vitamins may actually be lower than the dose tested in
this and other trials, and the potential
for harm at higher doses has been raised
by other studies.14 Also, since homocysteine levels were only measured in
5% of the sample, we were unable to
determine whether women with high
homocysteine levels at baseline may
have benefited to a greater extent both
with respect to homocysteine lowering and cardiovascular events.
Although this trial was the first to include a significant number of participants without prior cardiovascular disease (n=1950), power is still insufficient
to exclude moderate treatment effects
in primary prevention. Also, morbid-

ity and mortality follow-up rates in this
high-risk population were lower than
in other trials of primary prevention
using similar methodology23; and it is
thus plausible that a larger primary prevention population with higher rates of
follow-up might have demonstrated a
benefit. However, since the lost to follow-up rates did not differ between the
2 treatment groups in this study, they
are unlikely to account for the null findings observed. These remaining issues, along with the hypotheses regarding possible novel drug interactions
with vitamin C and angiotensin enzyme-converting inhibitors raised by
the subgroup analyses of this study,
warrant further investigation in future studies.
In summary, in the WAFACS trial,
a combination pill of 2.5 mg of folic
acid, 50 mg of vitamin B6, and 1 mg vitamin B12 had no beneficial or adverse
effects on a combined outcome of total
major cardiovascular events in a highrisk population of women with prior
cardiovascular disease or 3 or more
coronary risk factors over 7.3 years of
follow-up. Our results are consistent
with prior randomized trials performed primarily among men with established vascular disease3 and do not
support the use of folic acid and B vitamin supplements as preventive interventions for CVD in these high-risk–
fortified populations.
