Background. To compare sublingual misoprostol with intravenous syntometrine use during third stage of labor by measuring the blood loss.
Methods. <n>Sixty</n> women were randomized to receive either 600 mg misoprostol sublingually
or 1 ml syntometrine intravenously during the third stage of labor after spontaneous
vaginal delivery. For those with risk factors of postpartum hemorrhage such as medical
induction or augmentation of labor, previous third stage complications were excluded.
The blood loss in labor was measured by the alkalineâ€“hematin method, and differences in
hemoglobin before and after delivery were compared.
Results. There was no significant difference in the median measured blood loss between the
misoprostol group and the syntometrine group (280 versus 226 ml, p Â¼ 0.45). The change in
hemoglobin was comparable between the two groups. There were more women in the
misoprostol group who required additional oxytocics, but the difference was not statistically
significant. A major complication occurred in one patient in the misoprostol group with
blood loss in excess of 1000 ml. The incidence of side effects such as shivering and pyrexia in
women receiving misoprostol was significantly higher than that in the syntometrine group.
Conclusion. The use of sublingual misoprostol or intravenous syntometrine in spontaneous
vaginal delivery resulted in a comparable amount of blood loss. Transient side effect such as
fever and shivering which resolved within a day occurred more frequent to those who received
sublingual misoprostol.

Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is an important
cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. The
incidence of postpartum hemorrhage is often
underreported because of inaccuracy in visual
estimation of blood loss. The routine use of oxytocic agents in the third stage of labor, as part of
active management, has contributed to the reduction in the frequency of PPH by as much as 40%
in a meta-analysis of controlled trials (1). Most
commonly used oxytocic agents required paren-

teral administration, such as ergometrine, syntometrine (1 ml Â¼ Syntocinon 5 IU and ergometrine
maleate 0.5 mg), and syntocinon. Both syntometrine and ergometrine have to be stored at a temperature between 2  C and 8  C and have to be
protected from light. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog which is economical and stable in
room temperature. It is a potent myometrial
stimulant and has been extensively studied for
use in various stages of pregnancy. There are
many studies which have assessed its efficacy in
the third stage of labor. In a randomized trial, the
amount of blood loss, the duration of third stage
and the rate of postpartum hemorrhage were

comparable in two groups of women receiving
rectal misoprostol or parenteral syntometrine
(2). The rate of postpartum hemorrhage was
reduced from 9% to 6% by oral misoprostol in
a randomized, placebo-controlled study (3). The
data from a pharmacokinetic study suggested
that the bioavailability of misoprostol after sublingual administration was higher than those
after oral or vaginal administration (4). However,
the use of the sublingual route has not been
investigated in the third stage of labor. Furthermore, the visual estimation of blood loss is subjective and inaccurate. Therefore, we conducted
this study to compare the actual measured blood
loss after sublingual administration of misoprostol
with that after intravenous administration of syntometrine during the third stage of labor.
Materials and methods
This is an open, randomized, comparative study recruiting
healthy women with singleton pregnancies at term. Women
during the first stage of labor would be approached and
consent obtained. Those with any risk factors associated
with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage were
excluded, i.e. history of antepartum hemorrhage, antenatal
anemia, previous history of two or more surgical termination of pregnancies, previous manual removal of placenta,
or history of postpartum hemorrhage. Labor requiring medical augmentation would not be recruited. Only women with
spontaneous labor that ended up in normal vaginal deliveries were randomized. A total of 60 women with 30 primiparous and 30 multiparous were recruited.
Hemoglobin was checked in women on admission in
active labor. Parturients would be allocated using a random
number-generated table to receive either 1 ml of intravenous
syntometrine (syntocinon 5 IU and ergometrine maleate
0.5 mg) or 600 mg misoprostol sublingually immediately
after delivery of the fetal head. The third stage of labor
was managed actively using early cord clamping and cord
traction. The amount of blood loss was monitored closely,
and an additional oxytocic would be given according to
labor ward routine if necessary. The amount of blood loss
during the third stage was assessed as usual by visual estimation as well as by objective measurement. White linen was
used to drape the perineal area during delivery. Any blood
clots at delivery were collected and measured by a jug. An
objective method to determine the volume of blood loss was
carried out using a method previously described by Newton
et al. (5). This was based upon the formation of alkaline
hematin after the blood had been extracted from the sanitary
pads, white linen, or plain gauze. This was done by putting
them into an automatic stomacher Laboratory Blender
(Seward Laboratory, London, UK) for 15 min in 2 l of 5%
sodium hydroxide. The optical density at 550 nm of the alkaline hematin was measured by spectrophotometry and compared with that of a known volume of a sample of the patientâ€™s
venous blood. The volume of blood loss would then be calculated. Any complication in the third stage and side effects of
misoprostol would be noted. On day 2, the hemoglobin level
was repeated.
The primary outcome was the postpartum blood loss as
assessed objectively and subjectively. The change in hemoglobin levels after delivery, the need for additional oxytocics,
manual removal of the placenta, the duration of the third stage
of labor, and any occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage

would be assessed as secondary outcome measures. Any
apparent side effect was recorded as well.
From a previous study on the measured blood loss in
women with normal vaginal delivery and active management
of labor, the mean value was 368 ml with a SD of 200 ml (6).
Assuming that sublingual misoprostol is clinically superior
to syntometrine in further reducing blood loss by 200 ml, 60
subjects will have more than 80% power at 5% significance
to detect such a difference. SPSS 10.0 for Windows statistical
package was used for data analysis. 2 test or Fisherâ€™s exact
test was used for categorical data, and Mannâ€“Whitney
U-test was used to compare continuous variables. A p value
(two-tailed) of <0.05 was taken as statistically significant.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of the
Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong.

Results

The demographic characteristics of the 60 women
are shown in Table I. There is no difference in
the maternal age, gestational age, maternal BMI,
and the proportion of multiparity. The labor characteristics in both groups are shown in Table II.
The median duration of labor was 5 h in the
syntometrine group and 6 h in the misoprostol
group. There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidences of
episiotomy and perineal laceration.
Table III shows the hemoglobin levels, and
there was no difference between the two groups
in terms of the predelivery and postdelivery hemoglobin. The mean reduction of hemoglobin
was 0.5 g/dl in the misoprostol group, which was
comparable to the syntometrine group. In terms of
the blood loss during the third stage, there was no
difference between the groups in both the estimated and the measured median blood loss.
The number with third stage complications was
listed in Table IV. None of the patients in our

study required manual removal of placenta.
There were more women in the misoprostol
group who needed additional oxytocic and had
measured blood loss in excess of 500 ml. However, the difference was not statistically significant. In the misoprostol group, 30% of the
women suffered from transient shivering and
pyrexia, which resolved within 1 day. Nausea and
vomiting was uncommonly found. There was one
woman with major postpartum hemorrhage in
the misoprostol group. She was a 35-year-old
primiparous lady who delivered a 3.4 kg baby
vaginally after 10 h of labor. She developed
refractory primary postpartum hemorrhage due
to uterine atony which failed to be controlled by
additional oxytocics. An emergency hysterectomy was done at the end with the measured
blood loss in excess of 4 l. There was no abnormlity found on histological examination of the
uterus.
Discussion

Since the first report of the use of misoprostol in
the management of the third stage of labor in
1996, there are a number of randomized trials
comparing its use with placebo or other uterotonic
agents (7). In all these studies, misoprostol was
given either orally or rectally and compared with
oxytocin, placebo, or no treatment. The results
appear promising, although heterogenous (8â€“11).
In the Cochrane database review of 17 randomized trials by Gulmezoglu et al. (12), significantly
more women with a blood loss of more than 1000 ml
was found using oral misoprostol 600 mg as

compared with conventional injectable uterotonics. In developed parts of the world where
active management is the norm in hospital settings, multicentre, randomized, controlled trials
have shown that oxytocin is preferable to oral
misoprostol in the active management of the
third stage of labor (13).
There are disadvantages using misoprostol
orally at third stage of labor. Firstly, intake of
water is required for the oral route and there is a
risk of aspiration. Its action is slower because of
first pass effect. The rectal route on the other
hand may not be preferred by most women if
there is another route with similar efficacy. The
sublingual mucosal area is rich in blood supply to
allow direct absorption of medication. A pharmacokinetic study showed that the time to reach
the peak concentration was similar after oral or
sublingual administration of misoprostol, and it
was significantly shorter than that after vaginal
administration (4). The peak serum concentration was highest after sublingual administration.
The area under the misoprostol acid concentration versus time curve up to 360 min in the sublingual group was significantly greater than that
in the oral or vaginal group. Therefore, there is a
possibility that sublingual administration of misoprostol is more effective than oral administration. A few studies showed that using misoprostol
sublingually had a similar or even better efficacy
than oral route in induction of labor at term and
was accepted by most women (14,15). The use of
sublingual misoprostol in first trimester termination of pregnancy and in the management of
silent miscarriage has also been studied (16,17).
There is so far no report on the use of sublingual
misoprostol in the third stage of labor.
This randomized trial shows that the measured
blood loss during the third stage of labor using
600 mg misoprostol sublingually is similar to that
after intravenous syntometrine. The postnatal
anemia rate is comparable in both groups.
There are more patients in the misoprostol
group requiring additional oxytocic and have
postpartum hemorrhage, but the difference is
not statistically significant. There is one patient
in the misoprostol group who had emergency
hysterectomy because of refractory uterine
atony. It is, however, unlikely to be related to
misoprostol, as additional oxytocics were given
according to standard labor ward protocol.
Misoprostol is an agent easy to be administered. The sublingual route is a convenient way
that allows quick absorption and faster peak action than the oral route. Syntometrine has the
disadvantage of requiring special storage especially in the tropical climate. It also requires the

use of needle and syringe for parenteral administration. The use of misoprostol has therefore a
practical role in uncomplicated low-risk spontaneous vaginal delivery, especially in developing countries when resort to parenteral drug administration
is difficult. The number in this study is, however,
too small to establish equivalent effectiveness of the
two methods. The incidence of side effects of misoprostol is about 30% in our study which is similar to
other reports using the same dose orally (18). Most
of these side effects such as shivering and fever are
transient and self-limiting.
This study also illustrates that subjective assessment of blood loss in labor is inaccurate and often
underestimated. The amount of underestimation
can be as high as 30â€“50% of the measured volume,
as shown in another study as well (19). It is therefore more accurate to use measured blood loss to
compare the efficacy of different uterotonic agents
at third stage of labor.
In conclusion, sublingual misoprostol is comparable to intravenous syntometrine in the measured blood loss at third stage after spontaneous
vaginal delivery. A larger trial with a larger sample size is required to compare the clinical effectiveness of misoprostol sublingually with other
routes of administration.
