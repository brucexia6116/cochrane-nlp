healthy women in midwifery care at the University of New Mexico teaching hospital to 1 of 3 care measures
late in the second stage of labor: 1) warm compresses to the perineal area, 2) massage with lubricant, or 3)
no touching of the perineum until crowning of the infant’s head. The purpose was to assess whether any of
these measures was associated with lower levels of obstetric trauma. After each birth, the clinical midwife
recorded demographic, clinical care, and outcome data, including the location and extent of any genital tract
trauma. The frequency distribution of genital tract trauma was equal in all three groups. Individual women
and their clinicians should decide whether to use these techniques on the basis of maternal comfort and other
considerations. J Midwifery Womens Health 2005;50:365–372 © 2005 by the American College of

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 3 million women give birth vaginally each
year in the United States,1 and most experience trauma to
the genital tract from episiotomy, spontaneous obstetric
lacerations, or both.2 Since 1980, the frequency of use of
episiotomy has steadily declined from 64% of vaginal
births to under 30%, but in this same interval, repaired
obstetric perineal lacerations have risen from 11% to more
than 40% in vaginal births.2,3 The continued decline in
usage of episiotomy is supported by evidence from research, which shows that routine episiotomy confers more
harm than beneﬁt.4 But no evidence is available on how
best to reduce spontaneous genital tract lacerations after
normal vaginal childbirth.
Trauma to the genital tract at birth can cause shortterm and long-term problems for new mothers. The
degree of postnatal morbidity is directly related to the
extent and complexity of genital tract trauma.5 Shortterm problems (immediately after birth) include blood
loss, need for suturing, and pain. Protracted pain and
varying degrees of functional impairment affect many
women as well. At 8 weeks after birth, 22% of new
mothers have reported continued perineal pain, and for
some women, pain may persist for a year or longer.6
Genital tract lacerations after childbirth also weaken the

pelvic ﬂoor muscles. Thus, bowel, urinary, and sexual
function after childbirth may be adversely affected.7
Therefore, ﬁnding ways to prevent even some of this
trauma would beneﬁt many women. It would also simplify postpartum care by reducing the need for drugs,
suturing, treatments, and future ofﬁce visits to help
women cope with the aftermath of genital tract trauma.
Midwives use a variety of hand techniques in the
second stage of labor, whether practicing in or out of
hospitals, in the belief that these may help lower genital
tract trauma rates after vaginal birth.8,9 Two techniques,
warm compresses and massage with lubricant, have
potential therapeutic effects as detailed in textbooks for
physical therapists and massage therapists. These include
vasodilatation and increased blood supply, tissue stretching or extensibility, muscle relaxation, and altered pain
perception.10 –13 The choice of hand maneuvers is a
clinical decision at every birth and may vary according
to patient data, clinician preference, and institutional
norms. At present, no ﬁrm evidence supports any speciﬁc
recommendations on perineal management in the time
period prior to vaginal birth to reduce spontaneous
lacerations.
The main objective of this study was to compare
perineal management techniques late in the second stage
of labor to determine if any method was more effective
in reducing trauma in the genital tract with spontaneous
vaginal birth.14 The techniques compared were 1) warm
compresses, 2) massage with lubricant, or 3) no touching
of the perineum until crowning of the infant’s head. The

(deﬁned as no tissue separation at any site) after the
birth.
METHODS
Time Frame and Study Setting
This study was carried out at the University of New
Mexico Health Sciences Center (UNMHSC), from 2001
to 2005. Randomization of women in labor occurred over
38 months (October 2001 to December 2004). During
this period, no substantive changes occurred in the
clinical environment at UNMHSC, the midwifery group,
or the patient population.
The UNMHSC in Albuquerque is the only teaching
hospital in the state of New Mexico. Midwifery has been
a part of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology
for nearly 30 years. Twelve experienced nurse-midwives
maintain a busy clinical practice and teach a variety of
students. The midwives conduct more than 10,000 ambulatory care visits and approximately 800 births per
year at the University Hospital. They also perform
didactic and clinical teaching on a variety of topics,
including identiﬁcation and suturing of genital tract
trauma at birth for nurse-midwifery students, medical
students, and interns in family medicine and obstetrics.
The patient population primarily consists of non-Hispanic whites, American Indian, and Hispanic women
from Albuquerque and the surrounding areas. Evidencebased care regarding episiotomy in vaginal birth is
practiced by all birth attendants at UNMHSC (midwives,
obstetricians, and family physicians), and the episiotomy
rate is under 1% for all provider groups.
Consent and Eligibility
The study protocol and consent forms were approved by the
Human Research Review Committee of the UNMHSC (the local Institutional Review Board) and also by the
National Indian Health Service Institutional Review Board.
Patients in midwifery care at any of 5 ambulatory care sites
were eligible to consent for the study if they were 18 or

older, healthy, and expecting a vaginal birth. Verbal and
written consent was obtained in English or Spanish by the
clinical midwife. Often the consent process was extended
over several prenatal care visits to allow full discussion of
study participation and the usual conduct of normal childbirth. A sticker was placed in the standardized prenatal
record to indicate consent, refusal, or ineligibility for the
study. At hospital admission in labor, if a woman’s chart
indicated consent and prenatal eligibility, she was again
screened for normalcy and asked if she still wanted to
participate. Inclusion criteria at the time of randomization
included those women previously consented who did not
have medical complications and who had a singleton vertex
presentation at term.
Sample Size
Sample size was estimated by using the method of
Fleiss15 for the difference in proportions. We established
a clinically signiﬁcant result as an increase in the rate of
a completely intact genital tract (no tissue separation at
any site) from approximately 20% at baseline to 30%. To
detect this change with 80% power at the 5% level of
statistical signiﬁcance, the required sample size was
1200 women. This represents 400 women in each of 3
comparison groups (warm compresses, massage with
lubricant, and no touch). After 400 women had been
randomized in labor, the principal investigator, database
manager, and statistician assessed preliminary study
ﬁndings to determine if any technique was associated
with signiﬁcantly better or worse trauma outcomes.
Because none of the three techniques was associated
with improved perineal outcomes at that time, the study
continued with the original sample size unaltered.
Randomization
Random allocation to one of three perineal management
strategies was performed in a ratio of 1:1:1 within
balanced blocks of 12. A computer program was used to
generate the random allocation series. For each 12
women, 4 were allocated to compresses, 4 to massage,
and 4 to hands off, but the sequence varied randomly.
Next, sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes
were prepared by the database manager and study
administrator and stored in a metal box at a designated
place (with restricted access) in the hospital’s labor unit.
The clinical midwife selected the lowest numbered
envelope once vaginal birth appeared likely. The envelope contained a card with the study group allocation
(warm compresses, massage with lubricant, no touch)
and a data sheet to be completed after the birth. When the
envelope was drawn, the midwife signed the study
register and noted the date and time.
The envelope was opened when fetal descent began.
The perineal management allocation was implemented
with active fetal descent or when the fetal head was

visible with a uterine contraction. Warm compresses or
massage with lubricant were applied as continuously as
possible until crowning, unless the mother requested
they be stopped or the technique changed. Blinding of
the clinical midwives and their patients to group assignment was not possible. If at any time clinical circumstances warranted managing care in a different manner,
the midwife did so and documented her reasons.
Key Study Variables and Data Collection
The perineal management techniques were deﬁned as
follows:
●

●

●

Warm compresses were clean wash cloths made warm by
immersion in tap water and squeezed to release excess
water. They were held continuously to the mother’s
perineum and external genitalia by the midwife’s gloved
hand during and between pushes, regardless of maternal
position. Compresses were changed as needed to maintain warmth and cleanliness.
Perineal massage with lubricant was gentle, slow massage,
with 2 ﬁngers of the midwife’s gloved hand moving from
side to side just inside the patient’s vagina. Mild, downward
pressure (toward the rectum) was applied with steady,
lateral strokes, which lasted 1 second in each direction. This
motion precluded rapid strokes or sustained pressure. A
sterile, water-soluble lubricant was used to reduce friction
with massage. Massage was continued during and between
pushes, regardless of maternal position, and the amount of
downward pressure was dictated by the woman’s response.
No touch meant no touching of the woman’s perineum
during the second stage until crowning of the infant’s
head.

Women in all three groups received verbal encouragement, coaching, information, and praise from their midwife. No particular verbal or social interactions were
prescribed or prohibited.
Data collection after birth included the allocated
technique, what was actually done and for how long, and
whether the mother asked the midwife to stop or change
technique.
After birth, the midwife performed a thorough inspection of
the genital tract and noted the site and severity of any trauma.
These items were recorded on the postdelivery data sheet,
along with whether suturing was performed at any site. An
intact genital tract was deﬁned as absence of tissue separation
(no trauma whatsoever) at any site.
Additional data items included maternal age, parity,
race/ethnicity, years of completed education, body mass
index, weight gain in pregnancy, use of antepartum
perineal massage, and history of prior genital tract
trauma with vaginal birth. Clinical variables included
use of oxytocin and epidural, length of second stage,
style of pushing (valsalva versus self-paced without
prolonged breath holding), terminal fetal bradycardia,

compound presentation, whether the fetal head delivered
with or between contractions, position of the fetal head
at delivery (OA, OP, or OT), and complications or
unexpected birth events. Outcomes other than trauma
included type of delivery, infant birth weight, and Apgar
scores. Data were also collected from the postpartum
ofﬁce visit, in particular, the presence of anatomic
abnormalities, faulty healing of childbirth lacerations,
and continued perineal pain.
Data Management
Patient data forms were handled by the clinical midwives
or study staff only, all of whom completed training in
research ethics and patient conﬁdentiality. Data forms
were collected from the hospital several times per week
and entered into a database written especially for this
project. The study administrator and principal investigator also performed biannual chart reviews to retrieve
limited data from the 6-week postpartum ofﬁce visit. The
database for the study contained range and frequency
checks to reduce the likelihood of data entry errors. After
data from 400 births were entered into the database, a
10% random sample of paper records was systematically
compared with the computer-entered data, and errors
were found to be fewer than 1 per 1000 data items.
Clinical Preparation and Intervention Fidelity
Bimonthly meetings of the entire study team took place
in the 3 months prior to randomizing patients, and
monthly meetings were held during the ﬁrst year to
standardize the consent process, the perineal techniques,
assessment of all genital tract trauma, and collecting
complete data. Films, pictures and diagrams, role playing, and demonstration followed by counterdemonstration were used to facilitate discussion and attain consensus. After the ﬁrst year, quarterly meetings were held to
revisit the consent process and study protocol, discuss
any problems or concerns of the midwives, and share
updates on the study’s progress. Six months after patient
randomization began, a second midwife began attending
periodic study births, not as a caregiver, but to observe
the study intervention and trauma assessment of the
clinical midwife. The second observer made a separate
recording of what she witnessed, without any discussion
with the clinical midwife. These observations occurred at
random hospital shifts if a study birth was in process.
Data Analysis
All randomized patients were included in the analysis,
regardless of the route of delivery or whether they
actually received the assigned intervention (“intent-totreat” analysis). Means and proportions were compared
for the perineal management groups, including baseline
characteristics of study participants, clinical care re367

ceived, birth outcomes, and trauma experienced. Risk
ratios and 95% conﬁdence intervals were generated for
the relationship of the hand maneuvers to absence of
trauma in women randomized in the ﬁrst year versus the
rest of the study, by parity (ﬁrst birth versus others),
epidural analgesia (yes or no), and infant birth weight
(4000 grams or more, versus under 4000 grams). A
nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to
assess the association between the length of time that
warm compresses or massage with lubricant were applied and the presence or absence of subsequent trauma.
Logistic regression was used to assess the predictive
relationships of the hand maneuvers to the presence of
trauma, taking into account potentially related clinical
factors. Individual variables that were signiﬁcantly related to trauma were entered into a regression equation
for simultaneous adjustment. Backward elimination was
used to delete variables that were insigniﬁcant in the
presence of the others.
RESULTS
Data were collected from 1211 births over 38 months. The
ﬂow of participants through the study is illustrated in Figure
1. Two thirds of all clients of the UNM midwives consented
to participate in the study. Ten percent of women who gave
consent were exclusive Spanish speakers. The main reason
consent was withheld was maternal preference not to be in
a study (17% of all midwifery clients).
368

Of women who consented, 72.5% were randomized in
the second stage of labor to one of three perineal management strategies. Only 5 women changed their mind about
participating when admitted to the hospital in labor. At
admission, 20% of women who had consented were
deemed ineligible to participate because of medical problems that had arisen late in pregnancy; the most common
problem was gestational hypertension. Because clients
under age 18 and those with gestational age less than 37
weeks were excluded from the study, there were marginal
differences in these variables between nonrandomized and
randomized clients. There were no differences between
randomized and nonrandomized clients in parity or infant
birth weight. Eighty percent of all randomized women (n ϭ
965) had a postpartum ofﬁce visit with their midwife.
Table 1 shows characteristics of women at trial entry.
Randomization produced groups that were evenly matched for
all variables. No group differences were statistically signiﬁcant. The study sample shows considerable ethnic diversity,
and 40% of all participants were ﬁrst-time mothers.
Compliance with the study protocol is described in
Table 2. Midwife self-reported compliance with the
random allocation was 94.5% overall, and was similar
across intervention groups. One quarter of all study
births were observed by a second midwife, and compliance was 95.5% in that subgroup. In 5.8% of all study
births, the midwife was asked by the mother to cease the
allocated technique. The group of women who received

Table 3 shows data for relevant clinical variables in labor
and birth. Spontaneous vaginal birth was achieved by 1186
(98%) of all study participants, and 25 (2%) women had
operative deliveries. Nine cesarean births occurred late in
labor, and 16 women had vaginal operative births (3 by
forceps, and 13 vacuum). Only 7 infants had a 5-minute
Apgar score under 7 (0.6%). Eleven percent of all women
had a compound presentation (hand or arm), and nearly
11% had terminal fetal bradycardia. Four of 5 women were
sitting upright when giving birth. Other positions for birth
were ﬂat with stirrups used by 9.7%; lateral recumbent,
7.4%; and less than 1% each for squatting, hands and knees,
or standing.
Approximately 23% of all women in the study had a

extreme fetal heart rate abnormalities, 12 precipitate deliveries, 10 with postpartum hemorrhage, 9 (0.7%) with
shoulder dystocia, 2 with manual removal of placenta, and
1 with a symphysis separation. Of those women who had a
postpartum ofﬁce visit, 5% experienced a perineal problem
(continued pain, faulty healing, or anatomic abnormality).
Table 4 shows genital tract trauma outcomes. Only 10
episiotomies were cut in the study (0.8%), 7 in ﬁrst-time
mothers and 3 in multiparas. In 7 women, the indication for
cutting an episiotomy was severe fetal heart rate abnormalities. No episiotomy extended to a third- or fourth-degree
laceration. Twenty-three percent (n ϭ 278) of all women
experienced no trauma whatsoever, and the genital tract
trauma proﬁles were equal across perineal management
groups. Of women who experienced trauma, 242 (20%) had
major trauma (deﬁned as a second-, third-, or fourth-degree
perineal laceration; a laceration in the mid- or inner vaginal
vault; or a cervical laceration), and 691 (57%) had minor
trauma (deﬁned as a ﬁrst-degree perineal, outer vaginal, or
external genitalia laceration).
Results of the stratiﬁed analysis are presented in Table 5,
considering 4 potential confounding factors of parity, epidural usage, infant birth weight, or the ﬁrst year versus later
years of the study, which were speciﬁed at the outset of the
study. The perineal management techniques of warm compresses or massage with lubricant are compared with hands
off the perineum separately. In each set of comparisons,
both crude and adjusted risk ratios are not signiﬁcantly
different, indicating an absence of confounding from these
4 variables. Thus, neither warm compresses nor massage

For the compress group, the mean time the technique was

the fetal head between uterine contractions.
DISCUSSION
Results of this study indicate that warm compresses or
massage with lubricant provide no apparent advantage or
disadvantage in reducing obstetric genital tract trauma, compared with keeping hands off the perineum late in the second
stage of labor. Spontaneous childbirth lacerations are neither
more nor less frequent after use of any of the three methods of
perineal management tested in this clinical trial.
These results are unlikely to be explained by selection
bias. The randomization procedure produced groups that
were very similar with regard to demographic and prognostic variables. Midwives followed the ordered sequence of
the randomization scheme correctly. Concealment of the
allocated perineal strategy from the clinical midwife was
not possible. Therefore, the potential for reporting bias in
data collected immediately after birth was a possibility.
However, with 12 expert midwives participating in the
study and no midwife performing more than 13% of study
births, any clinician bias in data collection would be

The results are also unlikely to be explained by poor or
uneven compliance with the study protocol. Midwife selfreported compliance was very high and was equal across
study groups. This self-reported compliance was documented by a second midwife observer in a random sample
of 25% of the study births. To their credit, midwives in the
study setting were willing to suspend their individual
preferences in perineal management to carry out this
investigation. In 84% of births observed by a second
midwife, complete agreement between the two midwives
occurred for the site and extent of all obstetric lacerations.
Three quarters of disagreements concerned diagnosis of the
degree of minor trauma to the external genitalia.
The midwives at UNM have a high degree of expertise in
the conduct of normal childbirth, and their rate of an intact
genital tract (deﬁned as no tissue separation at any site) in
the study was 23%. This is higher than the rate of 16%
(using the same deﬁnition of “intact”) found in the HOOP
trial from the United Kingdom.16 Studies of perineal
outcomes have commonly deﬁned an intact genital tract as
“no trauma, or minor and unsutured trauma.” If this broader
deﬁnition were used in the current study, the midwives’ rate
of “intact” would be 73%, a startlingly high rate, given that
40% of all study participants were ﬁrst-time mothers.
Episiotomies are rarely cut by any care providers at the
UNM teaching hospital, and the obstetric culture favors
patience and vaginal delivery technique that is calm and
controlled, with emphasis on slow expulsion of the infant.
Women who experienced genital tract trauma received
warm compresses or massage with lubricant for greater
time in the second stage of labor, but a cause and effect
relationship cannot be assumed from this ﬁnding. Other
clinical factors associated with a longer second stage could
increase the risk of trauma while permitting longer receipt
of these perineal care measures.
Multivariate analysis identiﬁed six variables that predicted genital tract trauma in this study. Two variables,
nulliparity and high infant birth weight, have been repeatedly observed in prior research.17 The effects of race/
ethnicity and greater maternal education were small but
signiﬁcant. These four factors cannot be altered by clinicians but may indicate a need for special efforts to
minimize genital tract trauma in vaginal birth.
Two care measures were associated with a lower risk of
trauma. Giving birth sitting upright and delivery of the
infant’s head between uterine contractions are measures
familiar to practicing midwives and indicate several things.
A sitting position allows the mother greater comfort and
autonomy at delivery. It allows face-to-face proximity and
direct visual contact between the mother and midwife.
Delivery of the head between contractions requires communication, synchrony, and shared responsibility for a slow
and gentle expulsion of the infant.
Several factors might limit generalizability of the
ﬁndings reported here. First, the study setting may be
unusual in that episiotomy and vaginal operative proceJournal of Midwifery & Women’s Health • www.jmwh.org

dures are rarely performed by any care providers. This
allowed spontaneous lacerations to be a relatively pure
focus of the study. In settings where use of episiotomy
and vaginal operative procedures are more common, it is
difﬁcult to isolate spontaneous trauma from clinicianinduced trauma. Second, the 12 midwives who performed this study already have a high degree of expertise
at minimizing trauma in vaginal birth. The research team
hypothesized at the start of the study that if the hand
techniques could lower trauma rates with these clinicians, they would likely have greater health potential
elsewhere. Third, the possibility exists that the hand
techniques used in this setting might improve patient
outcomes in other places where clinicians have higher
baseline rates of childbirth lacerations. Warm compresses and massage with lubricant require the constant
bedside presence of the birth attendant, which women
appreciate. Greater support and intensity of interaction
may affect how women respond to what clinicians do.
Strengths of the study include the random assignment of
the perineal care measures, the large sample of healthy
gravidas, the high degree of midwife compliance with
the study protocol, and the accuracy of data collection.
Data from this study demonstrated that with rare use
of episiotomy and vaginal operative delivery, low rates
of serious obstetric trauma were achieved. Most trauma
was minor and affected the external genitalia, the outer
vagina, or perineum (ﬁrst-degree). Neither the use of
warm compresses nor perineal massage with lubricant
late in the second stage of labor increased or decreased
the overall rates of genital tract trauma. These results
support the choice of perineal management strategy by
individual women and their birth attendants, based on
maternal comfort and other clinical factors, but not for
presumed trauma reduction. However, clinicians are
advised to review their usual practices regarding maternal positioning at birth and infant delivery technique to
help lower the incidence of obstetric genital tract trauma.
