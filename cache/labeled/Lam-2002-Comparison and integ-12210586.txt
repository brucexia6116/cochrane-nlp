Background It is uncertain whether ﬁrst trimester nuchal translucency (NT) is more effective than the wellestablished second trimester serum screening for fetal Down syndrome or whether their combination works
best. We report data from a large multicentre non-interventional trial in which all subjects underwent both
ﬁrst and second trimester screening.
Methods All women who attended the obstetric clinic before 15 weeks’ gestation were recruited. An
ultrasound examination was performed at 10 to 14 weeks to measure the NT. The nuchal measurements
were not acted upon unless the fetus showed gross features of hydrops fetalis. All women had serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) assay at 15 to 20 weeks. The Down
syndrome risk assigned by serum screening was disclosed and amniocentesis was offered if this assigned risk
was o1 : 250 or if the women were 35 years and older. The efﬁcacy of different combinations of screening
markers was compared.
Results Between January 1997 and August 2000, 17 <n>590</n> women were recruited (19% o35 years old). After
excluding subjects who miscarried, defaulted the serum test and other reasons, 16 237 pregnancies were
analysed. Of these, 35 pregnancies were affected by Down syndrome (2.2 cases per 1000 pregnancies). At a
false-positive rate of 5%, the detection rate of Down syndrome by NT alone, NT and age, serum hCG, AFP
and age, and NT, hCG, AFP and age were 61%, 69%, 73% and 86%, respectively.
Conclusion Integration of NT and second trimester serum AFP and hCG assay yielded the best screening
efﬁcacy for Down syndrome. Copyright # 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome can be accurately made by cytogenetic studies on samples
obtained from invasive procedures such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Because these
procedures are associated with a 0.5% to 1% risk of
miscarriage, the common approach is to perform noninvasive screening tests to deﬁne an individual
woman’s risk of having a Down syndrome pregnancy
before subjecting her to a diagnostic test. The most
commonly employed screening test is based on the
combination of maternal age and maternal serum
assay of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic
gonadotrophin (hCG) and other analytes in the second
trimester (Palomaki et al., 1997). This yields a
detection rate of 60–70% for a 5% false-positive rate

(Cuckle, 2000; Lam et al., 1998). Recently, efforts were
made to increase the screening efﬁcacy by adding new
markers such as inhibin-A (Wald et al., 1996; Lam and
Tang, 1999) and to move screening forward into
the ﬁrst trimester (Malone et al., 2000). The most
commonly used marker for Down syndrome in the
ﬁrst trimester is sonographic measurement of nuchal
translucency (NT), though studies of its efﬁcacy have
yielded widely conﬂicting results with detection rates
ranging from 29% to 91% (Malone et al., 2000).
Because of the spontaneous loss of Down syndrome
fetuses between the ﬁrst and second trimesters, direct
comparison of the screening efﬁcacy derived from ﬁrst
trimester intervention studies with that derived from
second trimester studies will be invalid (Malone et al.,
2000). Recently, Wald et al. (1999) proposed a new
concept of screening by integrating ﬁrst and second
trimester markers that may improve the screening
efﬁcacy dramatically. In the present study, we report
our data on a large multicentre non-interventional trial
in which all subjects underwent both ﬁrst and second

12 weeks or amniocentesis at 15 to 20 weeks (Lam
et al., 2000) but a serum sample would still be taken
a few weeks after CVS or just prior to amniocentesis
for hCG and AFP assay.

METHODS

Subjects
This was a multicentre study conducted between the
years 1997 and 2000 in Hong Kong. Pregnant women
who attended at or before 14 completed weeks of
gestation and who agreed to be screened for fetal
Down syndrome were recruited. A written informed
consent was obtained from all subjects and they were
told that the NT was to be recorded for research
purpose and they would not be informed of the results.

Outcome ascertainment
Pregnancy outcome was retrieved from the hospital
record. If this was not available, the woman was
contacted by phone. In order to ensure complete
ascertainment of the Down syndrome pregnancies,
records of the cytogenetic laboratories responsible
for performing karyotyping for the ﬁve participating
hospitals were reviewed up to July 2001.

Statistical analysis
Ultrasound examination
All subjects underwent an abdominal and/or vaginal
ultrasound examination at 10–14 weeks of gestation.
The ultrasound examinations were performed by
either one of the authors who were experienced
obstetricians and who had undergone training in NT
measurements. The gestational age was ascertained by
the measurement of fetal crown–rump length at or
before 13 weeks, and by the measurement of biparietal
diameter and head circumference between 13 and
14 weeks of gestation. A sagittal section of the fetus
was obtained for the measurement of NT to the
nearest 0.1 mm (Nicolaides et al., 1992). NT was
always measured when the fetal neck was in a neutral
position (Whitlow et al., 1998) and the image was
adequately magniﬁed according to the guidelines of
the Fetal Medicine Foundation of London and all the
ultrasound images were continuously audited by the
chief investigator (Y.H.L.) (Herman et al., 1998). For
each fetus, the two best NT measurements were
averaged. To adjust for the effect of gestational age,
all the NT measurements were converted to multiples
of the median (MoM) for the gestational day (Yagel
et al., 1998; Lam et al., 1999). The NT were not
disclosed to the subjects or their obstetricians or acted
upon unless the fetus showed ultrasound features of
generalised hydropic changes.

Serum screening
All subjects underwent serum screening in the second
trimester by the assay of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) between
15 and 20 weeks of gestation. The Down syndrome
risk assigned by serum screening was disclosed and
women with a risk at or above 1 : 250 were offered
amniocentesis (Lam et al., 1998). The risk cut-off was
chosen to achieve a detection rate of around 60% and
a false-positive rate (i.e. amniocentesis rate) of around
5% (Lam et al., 1998). Women aged 35 years and older
or those who had other risk factors for fetal
chromosomal disorders were given the options of
undergoing chorionic villus sampling (CVS) at 10 to

All markers were expressed as MoMs of the unaffected
pregnancies at a given gestational age. AFP and hCG
MOMs were adjusted for maternal weight as described
by Neveux et al. (1996) using commercially available
software (Robert Macial, USA). The detection rates
and false-positive rates of the screening methods [ﬁrst
trimester NT, second trimester hCG and AFP assay
and an integration of the ﬁrst and second trimester
markers (the integrated test)] were obtained by
following the model-based likelihood ratio approach
described by Royston and Thompson (1992). Speciﬁcally, all the markers were ﬁrst logarithmic (base 10)
transformed and a multivariate Gaussian distribution
was ﬁtted for each of the affected and unaffected
pregnancies. Adequacy of each of the two multivariate Gaussian distributions was examined by using
Shapiro-Wilks and V tests in each and all subsets of
the three markers and by comparing the observed and
predicted likelihood ratios (Royston and Thompson,
1992). Using the age-speciﬁc risk of having a Down
syndrome pregnancy and the maternal age distribution
in Hong Kong in 1994 (Hong Kong College of
Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 1996), the detection
rate and false-positive rate for a particular risk cut-off
level were obtained numerically for different screening
methods. Thus, the receiver-operating characteristic
curves (ROC, i.e. plot of detection rate against falsepositive rate over different risk cut-off levels) could be
constructed.
Screening accuracy of the different methods was
then compared by their detection rates at a 5% falsepositive rate, the total area under the ROC curve, and
the partial area under the ROC curve (deﬁned as the
part of the curve where the false-positive rate was
between 0% and 10%). Estimates of the three measures
were computed as above while their 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CI) were obtained and comparisons were
examined by parametric bootstrap of size 300 since
no standard methods were available (Efron and
Tibshirani, 1993). Speciﬁcally, 300 sets of samples
were re-sampled from the two ﬁtted multivariate
Gaussian distributions for the affected and unaffected
pregnancies. The analysis was repeated on these
samples and thus 300 sets of bootstrapped measure

estimates were obtained for each screening method.
The 95% CI of a measure for a screening method was
then taken as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
corresponding bootstrapped measure estimates. With
the same 300 sets of bootstrapped estimates, a nonparametric Friedman’s test was used to examine
the overall difference and pair-wise differences of a
measure among the different screening methods. All
the statistical analysis was performed using the
Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 8.
RESULTS
Between January 1997 and August 2000, 17 590
women were recruited. After excluding those pregnancies in which NT were unsuccessful (n=39), those
affected by chromosomal abnormalities other than
trisomy 21 (n=48) or other major non-chromosomal
abnormalities (n=160), subjects who defaulted the
second trimester serum test (n=1015) and those who
miscarried after NT measurements and before the
second trimester serum test (n=91), 16,237 pregnancies which completed both ﬁrst and second trimester
screening were analysed. The mean maternal age of
unaffected pregnancies was 30.5 years (19% were
35 years and older). The mean gestational age at ultrasound scan and gestational age at second trimester
serum screening were 87 days and 16 weeks, respectively. Of these 16,237 pregnancies, 117 women (0.7%)
underwent CVS (none were affected by Down
syndrome) and 1913 women (11.8%) underwent
amniocentesis. A total of 35 pregnancies were affected
by Down syndrome (2.2 cases per 1000 pregnancies)

and all the diagnosis were ascertained at or beyond
15 weeks of gestation or after birth. Pregnancy outcome was ascertained in 15,253 pregnancies (93.9%).
NT measurements were successful in 99.8% of cases
and this was performed by abdominal ultrasound
examination in 98.6%. NT increased with gestational
age and a log-linear model ﬁtted the data well (NT
median=100.005342rgestational daysx0.259). The log means
(tstandard deviations) of NT MOM for affected
and unaffected pregnancies were 0.25 (t0.17) and
0.00 (t0.13), respectively. NT was not correlated
with maternal age, hCG and AFP, except a small
signiﬁcant correlation between NT MOM and hCG
MOM in the Down syndrome pregnancies (r=
0.363, p=0.03; Pearson correlation test). Figure 1
shows the ROC curves of the different methods of
screening for Down syndrome. The areas under the
ROC curves by different methods of screening are
shown in Table 1. The differences in the areas
between different methods of screening were statistically signiﬁcant ( p<0.001). The integrated test
yielded the best result. Second trimester hCG and
AFP screening performed slightly better than NT and
the difference was statistically signiﬁcant (Table 1).
At a 5% false-positive rate (a risk cut-off of 1 : 320),
the detection rate of Down syndrome pregnancies by
the integrated test was 85.7% (95% CI, 76.2–92.1%).
This was greater than the detection rate achieved
with second trimester hCG, AFP and age (73.2%;
95% CI 63.4–82.9%), NT and age (69.3%; 95% CI
56–76.1%) or NT alone (60.8%; 95% CI 41.7–69.4%).

hCG, AFP and age with the integrated test showed
statistically signiﬁcant differences in the detection rates
(pair-wise p values were all<0.001). Conversely, the
integrated test resulted in a much lower false-positive
rate than the other combinations to achieve a 70%
detection of Down syndrome pregnancies (Table 2).
In the US and other places, screening for Down
syndrome is primarily offered to women under
35 years of age (ACOG Committee, 1994). In the
present study, 13,120 women were less than 35 years
old and 12 of these pregnancies were affected by Down
syndrome (0.9 cases per 1000 pregnancies). Re-analysis
of the data showed that using a risk cut-off of 1 : 320
(that would result in an overall false-positive rate of
5%), the integrated test would detect 75% of the Down
syndrome pregnancies at a false-positive rate of 2.6%
in women less than 35 years old. Using this risk cutoff, 352 young subjects would be screen-positive of
which nine were true-positives and 343 were falsepositives. The odds of being affected given a positive
screening result in the young subjects were 1 : 38. The
corresponding detection rate, false-positive rate and
odds of being affected given a positive screening result
for women 35 years and older were 93.3%, 15.1% and
1 : 22, respectively. Figure 2 shows the ROC curves of
the different methods of screening for Down syndrome

DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst report of data on pregnancies that have
undergone both ﬁrst and second trimester screening
without action being taken on the ﬁrst trimester NT
measurements. This allows a valid comparison of the
screening performance of NT versus second trimester
serum screening. Despite the use of a double test (hCG
and AFP) that may be inferior to a test that incorporates unconjugated estriol (uE3) and inhibin-A
(Wald et al., 1999), we demonstrated that NT detects
69% of Down syndrome fetuses which is inferior to the
73% detection rate of the double test. Examination of
the ROC curves conﬁrms that the screening efﬁcacy of
NT is inferior to the double test (Figure 1). We realise
the vital importance of sonographer training and
auditing to the performance of NT-based screening.
The tight distribution (SD=1.3 MOM) of NT in the
controls provides some evidence to this quality
control. Despite this effort, the present data on NT
is slightly inferior than that reported by the Fetal
Medicine Foundation (Snijders et al., 1998). In that
study 96,127 patients at both high and low risk had
nuchal screening at 22 centres in the UK. At a 5%
false-positive rate, 77% of the Down syndrome pregnancies were detected (Snijders et al., 1998). Because
that was an interventional study, the majority of the
Down syndrome cases were ascertained in the ﬁrst
trimester. It is well known that some of the Down
syndrome pregnancies are spontaneously miscarried
between the ﬁrst and second trimesters (Morris et al.,
1999). Detection rate will be exaggerated if NT
preferentially detects cases that are more likely to
miscarry. We believe that the present study provides a
better estimation of the screening performance of NT
because of its non-interventional design and the fact
that all the Down syndrome cases were ascertained at
or beyond the second trimester.
The present data show that the integrated test
provides the highest screening efﬁcacy. The detection
rate can be increased from 73% to 86% at a 5% falsepositive rate. However, extra resources will be needed
for ultrasound examination. In the present study, it
meant an extra cost of 16 237 NT measurements to
detect ﬁve additional Down syndrome fetuses that
would have been missed by the serum double test.
Whether this is cost-effective depends largely on the
cost of an ultrasound examination in the locality
versus the cost of, and suffering associated with,
raising a child with Down syndrome. Conversely, the
integrated test reduces the false-positive rate from 5%
to 0.8% to achieve the current 70% detection rate of
Down syndrome pregnancies. This strategy will reduce
substantially the number of unaffected pregnancies
subjected to the risk of amniocentesis and hence the
resultant unnecessary fetal loss. It will reduce the cost
spent on unnecessary amniocentesis. Because fewer
women will be labelled screen-positive, this may reduce

the unnecessary anxiety associated with receiving an
abnormal result that may persist into the postpartum
period (Marteau et al., 1992). Nevertheless, costeffectiveness was not the research question of interest
to the present study and hence this issue should be
addressed by further studies.
Besides the better screening efﬁcacy, the integrated
test has several other potential advantages. First, it
will avoid the problem of sequential screening and
the confusion created by giving ﬁrst and second
trimester results independently that may be contradictory. Second, the diagnostic test will be amniocentesis rather than CVS. A meta-analysis of randomised
trials comparing these two invasive procedures showed
that ﬁrst trimester CVS was associated with more
sampling and technical failures, more false-positive
and false-negative results and more pregnancy losses
(Alﬁrevic et al., 2000). CVS is also considered to be
a more difﬁcult procedure to learn (Wijnberger
et al., 2000). Thus, it is probably easier and safer to
implement the integrated test in centres with an
existing second trimester screening protocol and
established expertise in amniocentesis rather than
moving screening into the ﬁrst trimester. The strategy
also allows continuation of second trimester AFP
screening for neural tube defect and provides Down
syndrome screening for the occasional late attendees.
Third, the integrated test will avoid detecting Down
syndrome cases that are destined to miscarry between
the ﬁrst and second trimesters.
The main disadvantage of the integrated test is the
time lag between the ﬁrst screening by NT and
reporting of the screening results which may take up
Copyright # 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

to 5 weeks and so delay the diagnosis of an affected
pregnancy beyond 15 weeks of gestation. Some women
may ﬁnd this waiting and delay unacceptable. Conversely, some women may not return for secondtrimester serum screening thus making the integration
impossible. Because of these potential advantages and
disadvantages of the integrated test, we believe that
the women should be given the information and be
allowed to choose between different methods of
screening.
It is well known that both NT and the second
trimester serum test can detect aneuploidies other than
Down syndrome (Chitty, 1998). In the present study
we have excluded pregnancies affected by other
chromosomal abnormalities from analysis. Because
the number of fetuses affected by each individual
aneuploidy was few, we could not assess whether the
integrated test was useful in detecting these cases. This
issue should be addressed by further studies.
An important limitation of the present study is that
we cannot ascertain pregnancy outcome in 6% of the
subjects. In Hong Kong there is no Down syndrome
registry, however each of the participating hospitals
have a registry of birth malformations. To ensure
complete ascertainment of the Down syndrome cases
we have tried to contact the women individually and
have reviewed the records of the cytogenetic laboratories. According to the maternal age distribution of
the subjects studied and the second trimester incidence
of Down syndrome (Cuckle et al., 1987; Snijders et al.,
1999), the estimated number of Down syndrome
pregnancies in the present series should be around
38, i.e. a similar ﬁgure to the ascertained cases. Hence

comparison of efﬁcacy of different methods of screening in the present series should be valid.
