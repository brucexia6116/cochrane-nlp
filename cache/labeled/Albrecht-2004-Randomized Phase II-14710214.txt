Based on the results of combined data from three North American Phase II studies, a randomised Phase II study in the same patient
population was performed, using combination chemotherapy with estramustine phosphate (EMP) and vinblastine (VBL) in hormone
refractory prostate cancer patients. In all, 92 patients were randomised into a Phase II study of oral EMP (10 mg kg day continuously)
or oral EMP in combination with intravenous VBL (4 mg m2 week for 6 weeks, followed by 2 weeks rest). The end points were
toxicity and PSA response in both groups, with the option to continue the trial as a Phase III study with time to progression and
survival as end points, if sufficient responses were observed. Toxicity was unexpectedly high in both treatment arms and led to
treatment withdrawal or refusal in 49% of all patients, predominantly already during the first treatment cycle. The mean treatment
duration was 10 and 14 weeks, median time to PSA progression was 27.2 and 30.8 weeks, median survival time was 44 and 50.9
weeks, and PSA response rate was only 24.6 and 28.9% in the EMP/VBL and EMP arms, respectively. There was no correlation
between PSA response and survival. While the PSA response in the patients tested was less than half that recorded in the North
American studies, the toxicity of EMP monotherapy or in combination with VBL was much higher than expected. Further research on
more effective and less toxic treatment strategies for hormone refractory prostate cancer is mandatory.

The median duration of response of metastatic prostate cancer to
androgen ablation is approximately 12 – 16 months (Crawford et al,
1989). The management of hormone escaped metastatic prostate
cancer is difficult and there is no standard therapy at the present
time. The median survival time is only 9 – 12 months. The
evaluation of new agents in metastatic prostate cancer by the
Genito-Urinary Group of the European Organisation on Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC GU Group) has taken the form
of a series of Phase II studies using measurable soft-tissue
metastases as indicator lesions. Based on a 29% partial response
rate in a previous study of mitomycin C (MMC) (Jones et al, 1986),
the EORTC GU Group undertook a Phase III trial comparing MMC
with estramustine in an unselected group of hormone-escaped
metastatic patients. This showed that both agents were much more
toxic than suggested by previous Phase II trials, and failed to
confirm the previous response rate (Newling et al, 1993). Although
Phase II studies with measurable lesions are necessary to

investigate possible activity in hormone refractory prostate cancer,
for practical purposes, testing for activity and toxicity must be
undertaken in the more common situation of hormone-escaped
disease with bone metastases and local progression rather than just
in patients with less common lymph node and other soft tissue
metastases.
Estramustine, a combination of an oestrogen with a nornitrogen mustard, disrupts the cytoplasmatic microtubules,
inhibits the assembly of the nuclear matrix and the multidrug
resistance transporter p-glycoprotein (Mareel et al, 1988; Perry
and McTavish, 1995). Estramustine phosphate (EMP) is commonly
used for the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer and
historical data have shown a clinical response rate of about 30%
(Van Poppel and Baert, 1991). In all, 18 Phase II studies of singleagent estramustine in 634 patients showed objective measurable
responses in only 19% (Benson and Hartley-Asp, 1990). Vinblastine (VBL) has been shown to induce objective tumour regression
in 21% (Dexeus et al, 1995). Estramustine phosphate and the
vinca-alcaloids inhibit the cellular microtubular apparatus by
distinct molecular mechanisms, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect
of the combination could exceed that of each single agent. This
additive and possible synergistic effect has been observed in vitro
(Benson and Hartley-Asp, 1990).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Trial design
The study was a randomised Phase II trial simultaneously
screening two treatment regimens. Patients were randomised to
receive either EMP and VBL combination chemotherapy (Group 1)
or EMP alone (Group 2). The end points were the overall response
rate monitored by PSA response, toxicity and quality of life.
If, after this Phase II study, the toxicity was considered to be
acceptable and if the estimated response rate on the combination
arm was at least as high as in the monotherapy arm, the trial would
be continued as a randomised Phase III study, taking the duration
of survival as the main end point.
Central registration, randomisation, and data collection were
undertaken at the EORTC Data Center in Brussels. All participating centres had to provide evidence of local ethics committee
approval before being allowed to enter patients. Patient-informed
consent was required before randomisation. Stratification at
randomisation was performed for institution and performance
status.

Investigations
Pretreatment investigations included standard haematologic and
biochemical parameters, serum PSA level and performance status,
and these were to be repeated after every cycle; the site and
estimated number of metastases, chest X-ray and bone scan were
to be repeated after every two cycles. Quality of life was assessed by
the EORTC QLQ-C30( þ 3) questionnaire plus the prostate cancer
module before the start of the treatment, and repeated after every
two cycles of 8 weeks each.

Eligibility
Patients with histologically proven metastatic prostate cancer
showing evidence of disease progression based on a rising serum
PSA (doubling of the lowest ever evaluated PSA value ¼ nadir)
and/or new metastases demonstrated by appropriate imaging
techniques, or deterioration of performance status, or pain or
weight loss due to prostate cancer despite sustained previous
hormone therapy were eligible. The minimum PSA level required
was 10 ng ml or X2.5 Â normal PSA.
As EMP also lowers the testosterone levels, only patients
who had undergone sufficient antiandrogen therapy (orchiectomy,
LHRH) with serum testosterone at castrate level prior to
progression were included. Patients taking oral antiandrogen
monotherapy were ineligible. Patients treated with total androgen
blockade had to stop antiandrogens at least 4 weeks prior to trial
entry and were eligible only if there was evidence of progression 4
weeks after the cessation of the antiandrogen. LHRH agonist depot
injections were maintained.
Prior radiation therapy to the primary and for metastases,
as well as the systemic administration of radionuclides,
was allowed. Patients of all ages with a life expectancy of
more than 90 days and a WHO performance status of 0 – 2
were included. An adequate bone marrow reserve was required
with a white blood cell count X3.0 Â 109 l and platelet
count X100 Â 109 l. If, however, a lower count was judged to
be due to tumour invasion of the bone marrow, treatment
could be initiated. Adequate renal (creatinine p1.5 Â normal)
and liver (bilirubin p1.5 Â normal) functions were also
required.
Eligibility criteria included no prior treatment with systemic
cytotoxic drugs, corticosteroids or steroid-containing drugs.
Previous second malignancies (except treated basal cell carcinoma
of the skin or other cancers inactive for more than 1 year),
systemic congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, myocardial
infarction or stroke within the previous 6 months, uncontrolled
hypertension, deep venous thrombosis and active uncontrolled
infection were additional exclusion criteria.

Chemotherapy
Estramustine phosphate was given daily and administered orally at
a calculated dose of 10 mg kgÀ1 day. As each capsule contained
140 mg EMP, the calculated dose was divided by 140. This quotient
was rounded to the nearest integer to give the total number of
capsules, which were to be taken divided into three daily doses at
1000, 1500 and 2200 h at least 2 h before or after food, milk, milk
products, antacids or calcium-containing substances, which would
impair the absorption of EMP. Vinblastine 4 mg mÀ2 (to a
maximum dose of 7 mg) was given by i.v. push injection weekly
for 6 weeks, followed by 2 weeks rest. The cycles were repeated
every 8 weeks. Concomitant antiemetics (5HT3-antagonists) were
routinely administered.
Dose modification of VBL in the case of hamatologic toxicity
and neurotoxicity followed conventional guidelines. Reduction of
the dose of EMP was permitted for gastrointestinal toxicity, but
was not recommended for paresthesias, diarrhoea or hepatic
enzyme elevation. For both drugs, the following dose modifications were recommended: In the case of grade 2 toxicity, a
reduction to 75%, in the case of grade 3 or 4, treatment was
withheld. If toxicity was resolved by the next treatment, VBL dose
was determined by the worst grade of toxicity experienced. If
Grade 2, treatment was continued at 75%, if Grade 3 or 4,
treatment was continued at 50% of the last dose received.
In the case of a PSA increase, the treatment was continued until
PSA progression was confirmed and, if possible, until the
symptoms dictated a change of therapy. The likelihood of response
to third-line therapy was considered small, and therefore an
asymptomatic increase of PSA was not a reason for treatment
withdrawal.
Patients with an objective response or no change with a stable
performance status were maintained on treatment until objective
evidence of disease progression based on PSA or significant
toxicity developed. If a complete response was achieved, treatment
was continued, if toxicity allowed, for at least three more courses.

Clinical

Combined data from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (Seidman et al, 1992), Fox Chase Cancer Center (Hudes
et al, 1992) and MD Anderson (Amato et al, 1995) showed that
seven of 19 patients with measurable hormone refractory prostate
cancer responded to combined EMP and VBL chemotherapy.
Regression was noted for lymph nodes and lung metastases.
Overall partial remission was reported in 42% of 83 patients with
measurable disease and a decrease in serum PSA greater than 50%
was noted in 46 out of 83 patients treated in similar Phase II
studies at the three centres. As shown by these investigators and in
a previously published paper by Scher et al (1990), a 50% decrease
in PSA may be used as a parameter for response evaluation and
may also be a surrogate for survival. If a strong correlation
between PSA decrease and treatment response could be shown,
this would help to identify those patients who will have the most
benefit from chemotherapy as well as to identify the worst
subgroup, in which an ineffective and possibly toxic treatment
could be stopped early.
On the basis of the albeit limited data and the absence
of an effective alternative therapy the EORTC-GU Group
initiated a randomised Phase II study assessing EMP plus
VBL combination chemotherapy vs EMP alone, the latter still
being a generally accepted treatment in some European centres,
to determine the PSA response rate and the toxicity of these
treatments in patients with hormone-escaped, progressive, metastatic prostate cancer.

Response evaluation

Clinical

Except for patients who were progressive after one course, patients
were evaluable for response only if they had been treated for a
minimum of two 8-week cycles of therapy. Patients were evaluable
for toxicity if they had started treatment. Toxicity was documented
using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC-NCIC). Evidence of
response was documented exclusively on the basis of PSA levels:
Complete response: Normalisation of PSA (less than 4.0 ng ml,
Hybritech). Partial response: decrease from baseline PSA value by
50% or more, but without normalisation. Progression: increase by
50% or more from nadir PSA. Stable: all patients who did not meet
response or progression. The overall response was the best
response at or after 8 weeks.

Statistical methods
The minimum PSA response rate of interest was 40%. 20 patients
were to be initially treated in each arm. Thereafter, five additional
patients were to be treated in each arm for each PSA response seen
in the first 20 patients in each arm, up to a maximum of 40 patients
in each arm. Time to PSA progression and duration of survival
were estimated using Kaplan – Meier technique. As this was a Phase
II trial, no formal comparisons were made and no P-values are
provided.

Patients characteristics
All together, 90 patients were eligible. Two were ineligible, one in
each treatment group: one patient had no metastases and the other
had a PSA level o10 ng ml. The two groups were balanced with
respect to age, pain at entry and known prognostic factors, except
that patients on the combination of EMP and VBL had slightly
more bone metastases at entry (Table 1).

Treatment duration
Two patients on the combination arm received no treatment. Only
31.1% of the EMP/VBL patients and 42.2% of the patients on EMP
alone received two or more 8 weeks cycles. An additional 22.2 and
15.6% got between one and two cycles, respectively. The main
reasons for stopping were toxicity, treatment refusal by the
patients, progression according to the protocol or clinical
progression (Table 2). The median treatment duration was 10
and 14.3 weeks, respectively (Figure 1).

Toxicity
Among all eligible patients who received treatment, grade 1 and 2
myelosuppression occurred in 11.6%. on the combination arm and
in 4.5% of the EMP alone arm. In total, 27.9 and 26.7%,
respectively, suffered from cardiovascular toxicity. Two deaths
possibly related to treatment occurred in the combination arm
(one myocardial infarction and one cerebrovascular accident). In
the two groups, nausea was reported in 44.2 and 55.6%, vomiting
in 18.6 and 35.6%. Neurological toxicity was seen in 27.9 and
28.9%, liver function impairment was noticed in 9.3 and 22.2%
(bilirubin) and 32.6 and 24.4% (SGOT), respectively. A total of 11
patients in the combination arm had dose reductions (six due to
haematological toxicity, three gastrointestinal, two neurological)
and six patients in the EMP arm for gastrointestinal toxicity.
Details are given in Table 3a and b.

compare with those obtained in patients with bone metastases.
Patients with lymph node and soft tissue metastases respond much
better to therapeutic interventions and seem to tolerate chemotherapy better than those with bone metastases. This has led
several groups and a consensus conference to accept PSA as a
parameter for measuring treatment activity (Scher et al, 1990; Kelly
et al, 1993; Dawson and McLeod, 1997; Smith et al, 1998; Bubley
et al, 1999).
The strongest evidence to support a role for PSA as a marker of
response and as a surrogate end point is the correlation between
the magnitude of PSA decline and survival. Kelly et al (1993)
demonstrated a significant improvement in median survival in
patients with a 50% or greater decline as compared with a decline
of less than 50% in PSA after treatment. These analyses were
inherently biased because they were subgroup comparisons among
patients with probably different prognoses. Wide fluctuations were
seen in PSA values by Scher et al (1990), indicating a transient
effect of the drugs on PSA production. Thus, several authors
expressed reservations to use PSA as a surrogate end point for
survival (Bauer et al, 1999; Sridhara et al, 1995; Verbel et al, 2002).
Nevertheless, most current studies in metastatic prostate cancer
patients include PSA responses as primary or secondary end
points (Dawson and McLeod (1997); Smith et al, 1998). This
approach was also used in the previously mentioned studies
(Hudes et al, 1992; Seidman et al, 1992; Amato et al, 1995) as well
as in this trial. As mentioned in the Results section, in our trial
there was no correlation between PSA response and survival.
EMP has been used in Europe as the first choice for the
treatment of hormone-escaped metastatic prostate cancer (Van
Poppel and Baert, 1991). A previous EORTC Phase III study has
emphasised its limited activity and the relevant toxicity (Newling
et al, 1993). The three North American reports on the combination
of EMP and VBL suggested better efficacy, and good compliance
with acceptable toxicity (Hudes et al, 1992; Amato et al, 1995;
Seidman et al, 1992). A phase III study by Hudes et al (1999)
comparing vinblastine to vinblastine plus estramustine, using a
similar design as ours, reported a significant advantage with the
combination for progression-free but not overall survival in 193
patients. While gastrointestinal toxicity was worse with the adition
of estramustine, interestingly, there was significantly less granulocytopenia in the VBL plus EMP arm.
Therefore, the EORTC GU-Group started a randomised Phase II
trial with the option of extending the study to a Phase III trial if
these results were confirmed.
British Journal of Cancer (2004) 90(1), 100 – 105

However, our trial was not able to reproduce these results,
although the protocol was designed in the same way. The main
problem was the fact that only 31.1% of patients in the combined
agent arm and 42.2% of the patients in the EMP alone arm were
able to receive two or more cycles. The reason for early stopping
was toxicity (30.2 and 31.1%) or refusal by the patients (20.9 and
17.8%). Progression led to early cessation of treatment in 44.2 and
46.7%. This is in contradiction to the cited North American
studies, although their toxicity was equal to ours. Whether there
are differences in overall tolerance between the two continents or if
the European patients were treated at a later stage and therefore
were less well remains unclear. Moreover, about 20% of all patients
were taken off study because of clinical progression not according
to the protocol, for example, not meeting the criteria of PSA
progression. There was no difference in the stopping policy
whether the treating physician was a urologist or a medical
oncologist. We were also unable to reproduce the encouraging
results in PSA decrease as quoted in the North-American trials, as
our patients had less than half of the reported PSA response rate.
Recent analyses of EMP toxicity and pharmacology (Perry and
McTavish, 1995) have suggested that this drug may better be
administered over a limited number of days around the time of the
other cyclical anticancer drugs, rather than on a continuous daily
schedule, and this is supported by clinical studies (Petrylak et al,
1999; Savarese et al, 1999; Sinibaldi et al, 1999).
In this trial, both regimens with continuous daily EMP doses
caused a severe deterioration of the patients’ well being. Since the
patients are in need of palliation, the main goal of the treatment
should be to improve the quality of life. This goal could not be
achieved with either tested regimen. Based on these results,
continuation of the study as a randomised phase III trial was not
justified.

CONCLUSION
The PSA response rate in the patients treated with either regimen
was low, less than 30%, and toxicity was clinically relevant. Daily
continuous EMP monotherapy or in combination with VBL,
therefore, cannot be recommended as standard second-line
treatment when metastatic prostate cancer has become hormone
refractory. Further research on more effective and less toxic
regimens is needed.
