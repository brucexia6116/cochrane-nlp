Objective: To study the outcome of bilamellar tarsal rotation (BTR) trichiasis surgery performed by ophthalmologists versus that done by integrated eye care workers (IECWs).
Design: Randomized prospective interventional trial.
Participants: Nine hundred eighty-two patients with various degrees of trachomatous trichiasis in central
Ethiopia.
Methods: Trachomatous trichiasis patients in 3 woredas (districts) in central Ethiopia were enrolled. Trichiasis severity was graded. Patients were randomly assigned to surgery by 2 ophthalmologists and 2 IECWs. On
the seventh day postoperatively, patients were evaluated for undercorrection or other complications. If trichiasis
was present, it was considered a failure of surgery (technical failure), and patients were excluded from the
follow-up study, but repeat surgery was performed. Those patients with good correction at the seventh day were
examined again on the third and sixth months. Further follow-up evaluation is planned for the ﬁrst, second, and
third years postoperatively.
Main Outcome Measures: Recurrence rate, recurrence difference in the various grades, and difference
between surgeries done by ophthalmic surgeons and those done by IECWs.
Results: In the third month of follow-up, it was possible to locate 713 (73.0%) of the operated patients.
Eighty-one of 713 (11.4%) individuals and 94 of 1286 (5.4%) operated lids developed recurrent trichiasis in this
period. There was a linear trend of recurrence with grading (severity) at baseline (␹2 ϭ 22.017, PϽ0.001), but there
was no difference in recurrence by age (␹2 ϭ1.53, P ϭ 0.9 at the third month; ␹2 ϭ 1.43, P ϭ 0.9 at the sixth
month). There was also no difference with regard to gender (0.38 Ͻ odds ratio Ͻ 1.14, P ϭ 0.1). The recurrence
observed in the group of individuals operated on by ophthalmologists at the 3-month follow-up was 47 (12.1%)
lids, and the recurrence observed in the group operated on by the IECWs was 34 (9.9%) lids, with no statistically
signiﬁcant difference (␹2 ϭ1.38, P ϭ 0.24, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], Ϫ18% to 74%). At the 6-month
follow-up, 43 (6.2%) persons had recurrence (95% CI, 4.4%– 8%). There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference
between the 2 groups of surgeons at the 6-month point of follow-up examination (␹2 ϭ 4.46, P ϭ 0.2). The overall
recurrence was 124 (14.3%) lids within the ﬁrst 6 months.
Conclusion: Recurrent trichiasis is common, especially in cases where the degree of trichiasis is severe at
baseline. This suggests that these patients may need surgical overcorrection to decrease the recurrence rate.
The outcome of BTR surgery done by IECWs is similar to that of the ophthalmic surgeons. Because of these
ﬁndings, we recommend that training of IECWs in trichiasis surgery may help to ameliorate the effects of the eye
care worker shortage in developing countries. Ophthalmology 2004;111:578 –584 © 2004 by the American

Trachoma is an ancient disease, ﬁrst described clinically in
the Ebers Papyrus (1500 BC) and given the name trachoma
by Dioscorides.1 It is the second leading cause of blindness
worldwide, after cataracts.2 Trachoma is conﬁned to devel-

oping countries, where poor living conditions prevail, water
supply is meager, and sanitation is poor3–12.
Trachoma is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium. The disease begins with in-

ﬂammation of the conjunctiva, associated with the formation of lymphoid follicles and diffuse papillary inﬁltration.
Chronic inﬂammation eventually results in conjunctival
scarring, which in turn may lead to trichiasis/entropion.
Finally, due to the repeated brushing effect of the eyelashes,
the cornea becomes opaque. The resultant corneal opacity is
the ultimate cause of blindness in trachoma.13 In a longitudinal study on the incidence and risk factors for trichiasis
development in Gambia, 6.4% of subjects were found to
have trichiasis 12 years after the initial examination.14 Active trachoma usually starts early in life, but patients do not
develop blinding trachoma until later in adulthood.3 However, trichiasis is common in children younger than 10 years
in Ethiopia.
The prevalence of blindness in Ethiopia is estimated to
be 1.5% (Buden, report to the World Health Organization,
1981). The major causes of blindness in the adult population
are, in descending order of frequency, cataract, trachoma,
and glaucoma. Corneal blindness, conversely, is the leading
cause in the adolescent and child populations. The prevalence of active trachoma in children aged 1 to 10 years in
central Ethiopia was found to be 51%.15 In the same study,
the prevalence of trichiasis in the general community was
found to be 3.3%. In a similar study conducted in the
Gurage Zone of central Ethiopia, the prevalence of active
trachoma was found to be 56.3% (ranging from as low as
13.1% in the highlands [altitude greater than 2500 m above
sea level] to more than 70% in the lowlands [altitude less
than 2000 m above sea level]) among children 1 to 6 years
old (ORBIS, unpublished data). In this area, trachoma was
found to be the second leading cause of blindness after
cataracts.11 In another study in southwestern Ethiopia, corneal opacity secondary to trachoma accounted for 20.6% of
blindness and 10.4% of low vision.16 The World Health
Organization recommends that if the trachomatous inﬂammation (follicular) and trachomatous inﬂammation (intense)
are above 20% and 5%, respectively, in children 1 to 10
years old, and trichiasis 1% and above, trachoma should be
considered a signiﬁcant problem in the area. A mass treatment for trachoma is recommended.17
The currently accepted strategy for controlling trachoma
is SAFE (surgery, antibiotics for treating the active disease,
face washing, and environmental hygiene practice). The
combined efforts of these primary and secondary prevention
strategies are important in the control of trachoma and its
complications.
The prevalence of trachoma declined in developed countries, even before the advent of antibiotics, due to improvements in socioeconomic status, water supply, and levels of
awareness regarding environmental sanitation and personal
hygiene. Developing nations, where poor socioeconomic
conditions prevail, are still suffering from the effects of
trachoma.18 The long-term solution for controlling trachoma is working to address the F and E components of the
SAFE strategy. In the meantime, however, the surgical
management for trichiasis and treatment for the active cases
are the mainstay of management, combined with the implementation of the F and E components.
Surgery and epilation are the current modalities of treatment for trichiasis/entropion. Epilation is often performed at

the community level, usually by the patients themselves.
However, the new, regrowing sharp lashes are often more
damaging than the nonepilated ones (the authors’ unpublished data). Although it has a high recurrence rate, surgery
is the method advocated by the medical world.
Several studies examining the outcome of surgery have
been undertaken, but their ﬁndings are inconsistent. A study
in Oman concluded that tarsal rotation was successful in
80% of minor cases (Յ5 lashes touching the globe); for
major cases (Ͼ5 lashes touching the globe), however, tarsal
rotation was successful in 77% of cases, compared with
41% with tarsal advance and rotation (1-year follow-up).19
In another 3-year follow-up study in Oman, the recurrence
of trichiasis after surgery was found to be 40% to 50%.20 In
a 1-year follow-up study in central Ethiopia, the recurrence
rate was 17.8% (Assefa Y. Comparison of postoperative
outcome of upper eye lid surgery for trachomatous trichiasis, in central rural Ethiopia. Abstract presented at: Ethiopian Medical Association XXXVth Annual Conference,
May 19 –21, 1999; Addis Ababa).
These results are difﬁcult to interpret because of the
variation in surgical techniques, selection criteria for surgery, postoperative care, surgeons’ skills, and the possible
presence of active trachoma infection. The studies also had
a short follow-up period (except for the 3-year study in
Oman20), and all were retrospective.
In a country like Ethiopia where the prevalence of trachoma and trichiasis is high, the health service coverage is
meager, and trained manpower is in short supply, a good
strategy must be designed to reach the population in a
cost-effective manner without compromising the quality of
service. The purpose of this study is to determine the
recurrence rate of trichiasis after bilamellar tarsal rotation
(BTR) performed by integrated eye care workers (IECWs)
versus the rate after it is done by ophthalmic surgeons. To
our knowledge, there is no other information on the effectiveness of trichiasis surgery performed by nonophthalmologists, except for one report on the success of surgery
done by nurses in Tanzania.21 This study addresses the need
to investigate the effectiveness of this strategy for wider use
and application.

Materials and Methods
Operational Deﬁnitions
We employ the operational deﬁnitions of Melese and coworkers.22
The interobserver agreement level was high for the modiﬁed
grading.
Simple Trichiasis (TT1). At least 1 lash is inwardly deviated
or epilated, but there is no deviation of the lid margin at primary
gaze. If all of the turned-in lashes are medial to the nasal limbus of
the cornea, the trichiasis is nasal (TT1.1). If all of the turned-in
lashes directly touch the cornea, it is graded as central (TT1.2), and
if all are turned lateral to the limbus of the cornea, it is graded as
temporal (TT1.3). If the trichiasis involves Ն2 of the above
segments of the lid margin, then the case is classiﬁed as combined
trichiasis (TT1.4).
TT1.1. Nasal (medial to nasal limbus of the cornea).
TT1.2. Central (touching the cornea directly).

TT1.3. Temporal (lateral to the temporal limbus of the cornea).
TT1.4. Combined (involving more than one segment of the
above lid margin), but not all rows of lashes touching
the globe.

TT2.2. There is inward deviation of the upper eyelid margin,
all of the deviated lashes are deeply buried against the
eyeball, and the bases of the eyelashes are not visible
on primary gaze.

Entropion (TT2). Evidence of inward deviation of the upper
eyelid margin. All rows of lashes of the deviated margin should
touch the eyeball to be classiﬁed as entropion. The deviation may
be localized or involve the entire length of the upper eyelid margin.

Eyelid
Shortening
or
Defective
Lid
Closure
(TT3). Evaluated with the eyes closed gently, as in sleep. A lid
defect is present if the examiner observes a gap between the upper
and lower lid margins.
Failure of Surgery. Deﬁned as the presence of turned-in eyelashes within the ﬁrst 7 days of surgery. It is most likely as a result
of technical failure.
Recurrence. Deﬁned as at least one inwardly deviated eyelash

TT2.1. There is segmental or total inward deviation of the
upper eyelid margin, and all rows of the lashes of the
deviated margin touch the globe, but the bases of the
lashes are visible on primary gaze.

Integrated Eye Care Workers. Nurses or health assistants
who currently work in primarily rural government health institutions and who are trained for 1 month in primary eye care,
including trichiasis surgery. The nurses are high school graduates
trained for 3 years in general nursing. Health assistants are a health
workers who have completed the 12th grade level of schooling and
have received 1 year and 6 months’ training in basic health care.
Integrated eye care workers should do a minimum of 60 trichiasis
surgeries under the supervision of a trainer before certiﬁcation to
work independently. Integrated eye care workers’ training is approved by the Ethiopian Ministry of Health.
Woreda. A district with an average population of 150 000
inhabitants.

Study Design
The present study was conducted in the Lanfero, Eza, and Enemore districts of the Gurage Zone, in the Southern Nations,
Nationalities and Peoples Region. The 3 districts have a population
of nearly half a million. The baseline data surgery and data were
collected in December 2000. All of the study subjects are subsistence farmers, trachoma prevalence in children 1 to 6 years old in
both areas was 56%, face-washing practices were similar, and
latrine use is almost nonexistent in the study areas (ORBIS International Ethiopia, unpublished baseline data).
Estimating the recurrence rate of trichiasis in the ophthalmologist group to be 15% and that in the IECW group to be 20% at
1-year follow-up, with a conﬁdence interval (CI) of 95% and a
power of 80%, and using a formula for 2 proportions, a sample size
of 1000 was determined.
Two IECWs and 2 ophthalmologists were involved in the
study. Both groups were trained in the modiﬁed grading of trichiasis, the various registration forms, and the study procedures.
Patients were then given code numbers, their trichiasis graded
according to the modiﬁed grading system; consent was requested
for the surgery and follow-up; and, ﬁnally, their visual acuity (VA)
was measured. The patients were then randomized to each group of

surgeons. Both groups of surgeons performed the surgeries using
the BTR technique following the procedure recommended in the
World Health Organization manual.23 The patients went home
after surgery and returned the next morning to have the eyepatches
removed. They were then advised to wash their eyes with warm
water every morning and apply tetracycline eye ointment twice
daily until the entire tube was ﬁnished. On the seventh day all
patients came to the health center for re-evaluation and stitch
removal. The team member who was not involved in the surgery
determined if there was undercorrection or overcorrection on the
seventh day. If there was a surgical error, a correction was made.
If the correction was properly performed, the patient was given an
appointment for the 3-month follow-up examination. If there was
undercorrection, the same surgeon made a correction, but the
patient was excluded from follow-up. For the follow-up examinations, community health agents were given the names of patients
operated on and were instructed to assemble them in the health
post of their local Peasant Association. Ophthalmologists who did
not do the surgery evaluated patients on the 3- and 6-month
recurrence follow-up schedules. To minimize bias, these ophthalmologists were masked as to the qualiﬁcation of surgeons—that is,
they had no information as to which patients were operated upon
by ophthalmic surgeons and which were operated upon by IECWs.
Operated patients will be examined again at the ﬁrst, second, and
third years.
Data were entered and analyzed using the Epi Info program
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Public
Health Surveillance and Informatics, Atlanta, GA). In this interim
report, rates, ratios, chi-square tests, and other appropriate statistics are used. To see if there is a difference in recurrence with age,
the analysis is also stratiﬁed by age. At the ﬁnal 3-year follow-up,
an in-depth analysis will be performed.
All self-reported trichiasis patients, irrespective of age and
gender, residing in the 3 woredas and consenting verbally to the
surgery and follow-up were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria included patients with physical ﬁndings of raised jugular
venous pressure, irregular pulse, sign of cardiac disease, severe
hypertension, history of uncontrolled diabetes, history suggestive
of bleeding disorders, and allergy to local anesthetic. Patients who
declined to comply with the follow-up schedules received the

surgical service, the seventh day postoperative examination, stitch
removal, and the standard care, but were excluded from the study.
Patients who had previous trichiasis surgery were excluded from
the study.
All adult patients 18 years or older were informed about the
study procedure and were asked to give verbal consent. For young
adults and children younger than 18 years, who cannot give consent by law, a parent or guardian gave the informed verbal consent
(see Fig 1 -for the summary of the study procedure). The trichiasis
surgery has been approved by the Zonal Health Department, and
the Ophthalmology Department of the Medical Faculty of Addis
Ababa University has given ethical approval.

Results
Nine hundred eighty-two trichiasis patients were operated on;
90.6% were over 30 years of age, 3.2% were children younger than
15, and 77.2% were female. Out of the total of 1750 lids with
trichiasis, based on the modiﬁed grading system, 1393 (79.6%)
accounted for simple trichiasis (TT1); 355 (20.3%), entropion
(TT2); and only 2 (0.001%), eyelid shortening or defective lid
closure (TT3) (Table 1).
It was possible to measure VA in 956 (97.3%) of the patients
from the total of 982 operated on. Four hundred seventy-six
(49.8%) had a VA of Ն6/18; 379 (39.6%), between 6/24 and 3/60;
and the rest of the patients (101 [10.6%]) had a VA of Ͻ3/60
(Table 2).
During the 3-month follow-up, of the total of 982 operated
patients, 713 (73.0%), with a total of 1286 operated lids, came for
the examination. Out of 1286 operated lids followed at the third
month, 94 (7.3%) had recurrence. In terms of persons, 81 of the
713 (11.4%) individuals developed recurrence. There were 13
(16.0%) patients with bilateral recurrence from the total of 81
persons having recurrence (Table 3).
Among the lids with recurrence, 39 (41.5%) were graded as
TT1.4 preoperatively, and at recurrence only 10 (10.6%) were

Figure 2. Relationship between baseline grading and recurrence within 3
months, Gurage Zone.

TT1.4. Eighteen (19.1%) of the lids had a TT2.2 grade preoperatively, and the same number had a TT1.2 grade. Postoperatively,
there were no TT2.2 cases, and 30 (31.9%) had a TT1.2 grade
(Table 4). At recurrence, there were almost no severe grades
(TT2.1 or TT2.2).
There was a linear trend of increased recurrence as the trichiasis grading increased from a less severe to a more severe degree
(␹2 ϭ 22.017, PϽ0.001; Fig 2). There was no difference in
recurrence between genders (0.38 Ͻ odds ratio Ͻ 1.14, P ϭ 0.1).
Two ophthalmologists and 2 IECWs conducted the surgeries.
From the total of 713 individuals who came for the 3-month
follow-up, 370 (51.9%) persons were operated on by ophthalmologists, and 343 (48.1%) by IECWs. The number of individuals
with recurrence in the group operated on by the ophthalmologists
was 47 (12.7%), and that in the IECW group was 34 (9.9%), with
no statistically signiﬁcant difference (␹2 ϭ 1.38, P ϭ 0.24; 95% CI
for the difference, Ϫ18% to 74%) (Table 5). Granuloma was
diagnosed in 100 (14.0%) of the operated patients, and 44 (6.2%)
had minor irregularities at the lid margins.
During the 6-month follow-up, excluding those with recurrence
at the third month, 901 operated patients were expected to come
for the follow-up examination. Six hundred ninety-four (77.0%)
came for the examination; 43 of them (6.2%) had recurrence (95%
CI, 4.4%– 8%). In terms of lids, from the total of 1553 lids
examined at the sixth month, 46 (3.0%) lids had recurrence (95%
CI, 2.1%–3.8%). Only 3 individuals had bilateral recurrence of
trichiasis during this period. In total, in the 2 follow-up periods,
140 (9.0%) of the 1553 lids examined had recurrence. In terms of
individuals, of 982 operated on, 865 (88.1%) came for the 2
follow-up periods (123 did not appear for the 6-month follow-up
and were assumed to have no recurrence); a total of 124 (14.3%)
had recurrence within 6 months. It is not expected that those who
did not appear for follow-up differed from those examined; however, this was not able to be substantiated, as it was impossible to
trace the patients on 2 attempts. The grading of the recurred

trichiasis cases at the sixth month were 17 (36.9%) with a TT1.1
grade; 13 (28.3%), TT1.2; 12 (26.1%), TT1.3; and 4 (8.7%),
TT1.4. There were no TT2.1 and TT2.2 grades at recurrence. The
recurrence at 6 months involved an increase from TT1.2 to TT1.3,
stayed high at TT1.4, declined at TT2.1, and increased sharply at
TT2.2. Generally, there is a linear pattern of recurrence at 6
months similar to that of the third month: the more severe the
grade at baseline, the higher the recurrence; (␹2 ϭ 14.475,
PϽ0.0001; Fig 3). There is no difference in recurrence by age (␹2
ϭ 1.43, P ϭ 0.9). Recurrences in the ophthalmologist- and IECWoperated patients were 5.2% and 7.5%, respectively (␹2 ϭ 4.46, P
ϭ 0.2)

Discussion
Eighty-eight percent of patients who came for surgery were
between 30 and 74 years old. Other studies have also
conﬁrmed that the blinding complication of trachoma increases after middle age.3,6,4,12 Women accounted for
77.2% of the patients. Different studies have revealed that
women are affected more by blinding trachoma.3,4,8,24,25
We have not looked into the exact causes of low VA and
blindness in these patients, but 39.6% of the patients had
low VA (Ͻ6/18 to Ն3/60), and 10.6% were blind (VAϽ3/
60). In our study in the same area of Ethiopia, among adults
40 years and older, prevalences of low VA and blindness
were 12.1% and 7.9%, respectively.11 The high blindness
and low vision in our study subjects may be attributed
mainly to the trichiasis effect.
Within the ﬁrst 3 postoperative months, 81 (11.4%) of
those examined had recurrence, and 7.3% of the operated
lids had recurrence. Between the third and sixth months,

another 43 (6.2%) persons had recurrence. In general, in the
ﬁrst 6 months, 124 (14.3%) of the followed cases were
found to have recurrence. In terms of the operated lids, of
1553 examined, 140 (9.0%) had recurrence. Even though
the surgical procedure is not speciﬁed, in Tanzania, 19% at
24 months and 21% at 36 months were found to have
recurrence.21 There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in recurrence by age at both 3- and 6-month follow-ups
(␹2 ϭ 1.53, P ϭ 0.9 at the third month; ␹2 ϭ 1.43, P ϭ 0.9
at the sixth month). However, the rate of recurrence increases as the severity of the preoperative grade of trichiasis
increases from TT1.1 to TT2.2 (linear trend, ␹2 ϭ 22.017,
PϽ0.001 at the third month; at the sixth month there is the
trend still, except for a decline at the TT2.1 grade [␹2 ϭ
14.475, PϽ0.0001]). This indicates that overcorrection is
probably indicated in the severe forms of trachomatous
trichiasis, as determined by the grading at baseline. There
was no single TT2 case that remained the same at recurrence. That means the severity of trachomatous trichiasis
decreases after surgery, even if there is recurrence. Grades
of TT1.1 and TT1.3 do not directly touch the cornea. There
is a chance of touching the cornea when the eye moves, but
the pressure it exerts is less as compared with lashes originating in the central area (TT1.2). The recurrence is also
low for TT1.1 and TT1.3 cases at baseline. Therefore, there
is a need for further study of patients with these 2 grades to
determine the corneal damage effects, which will help with
the decision whether to operate in these types of cases.
Except for a single study conducted in Tanzania that
observed nurse-operated trichiasis patients,21 there is no
study on the outcome of surgery comparing surgeons. In the
3-month follow-up among the patients operated on by the
ophthalmologists, 12.7% developed recurrence, compared
with 9.9% of those operated on by IECWs (the difference
was not signiﬁcant). There also is no statistical difference in
recurrence between the 2 kinds of surgeons at 6 months.
The results of this study have demonstrated that trichiasis
surgery can be done by IECWs with the same outcome as
that of ophthalmic surgeons. Training of IECWs at the
district and subdistrict level helps to avoid the costs of
transport, food, and accommodation for the patient and
accompanying person/second. The other advantage of providing local surgery is that mothers usually will not travel
for eye care because there may be neither a person to look
after the children and their property nor someone to accompany them. A study on barriers to eye care in the same area
has shown that costs related to transport, food, and accom-

modation for the patient and accompanying person/second
came ﬁrst, followed by the medical cost, lack of an accompanying person, and no one to look after their property and
children when they are away for more than a day (ORBIS,
unpublished data). A study in Gambia also has shown that
providing village-level surgery increased the acceptance
rate of surgery and decreased costs and journey time, as well
as the patient’s fear of the surgery.26
In conclusion, the recurrence of trichiasis after BTR is
very high, and therefore, there is need for research to
develop a more effective surgical procedure. Finally, the
outcome of surgery done by IECWs does not differ from
that of surgery done by highly skilled and experienced
ophthalmologists. We therefore recommend training of
IECWs in trichiasis surgery to address the shortage of
trained professionals in our country and to reduce the huge
burden of blinding complications of trachoma.
