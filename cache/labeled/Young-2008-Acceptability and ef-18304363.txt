Abstract
Background: GPs often lack time to provide intensive cessation advice for patients who smoke.
This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of opportunistic referral of smokers by their GP
for telephone cessation counselling by a trained nurse.
Methods: Adult smokers (n = 318) attending 30 GPs in South Western Sydney, Australia were
randomly allocated to usual care or referral to a telephone-based program comprising assessment
and stage-based behavioural advice, written information and follow-up delivered by a nurse. Selfreported point prevalence abstinence at six and 12 months was compared between groups.
Characteristics of patients who accepted and completed the intervention were investigated.
Results: Of <n>169</n> smokers randomised to the intervention, 76 (45%) consented to referral.
Compared with smokers in 'pre-contemplation', those further along the stage-of-change
continuum were significantly more likely to consent (p = 0.003). Those further along the continuum
also were significantly more likely to complete all four calls of the intervention (OR 2.6, 95% CI:
0.8–8.1 and OR 8.6, 95% CI: 1.7–44.4 for 'contemplation' and 'preparation' respectively). At six
months, there was no significant difference between groups in point prevalence abstinence
(intention to treat) (9% versus 8%, p = 0.7). There was no evidence of differential intervention
effectiveness by baseline stage-of-change (p = 0.6) or patient sex (p = 0.5). At 12 months, point
prevalence abstinence in the intervention and control groups was 8% and 6% respectively (p = 0.6).
Conclusion: Acceptance of opportunistic referral for nurse delivered telephone cessation advice
was low. This trial did not demonstrate improved quit rates following the intervention. Future
research efforts might better focus support for those patients who are motivated to quit.

Background
Australian general practice provides a unique setting for
the provision of smoking cessation advice as over 80% of
the population visits a general practitioner (GP) in any
given year [1]. An 'opportunistic' approach to cessation
advice in which smoking is discussed with every patient,
irrespective of the reason for the consultation, has the
potential to reach a large number of smokers in the community [2]. Despite compelling evidence for their impact
[3-5] and their unrivalled credibility as providers of
health-related information [6], Australian GPs persistently exhibit low rates of detection of smokers and provision of evidence-based smoking cessation advice [7-10].
Those few randomised trials conducted in Australia to
redress this gap between evidence and practice provide no
clear-cut conclusions that any strategy will work to
increase GPs' systematic identification of smokers or
enhance rates of advice [11-14].
GPs themselves perceive lack of time to be one of the
major impediments to their intervention with smokers
[7,10]. Smoking cessation advice, particularly those intensive and time-consuming interventions known to be especially effective in promoting quit attempts and achieving
abstinence, could perhaps be delegated to and delivered
by a nurse [15,16]. A recent meta-analysis of 30 trials of
nurse-delivered cessation advice found a modest overall
positive effect when compared with controls or usual care
(OR 1.47, 95%CI: 1.29–1.68) [17]. A subgroup analysis
of those 11 studies involving smokers in primary care or
out-patient settings indicated that smoking intervention
by nurses almost doubled the odds of success (OR 1.90,
95%CI 1.48–2.43) [17]. In all of these studies, smokers
were required to attend at least one face-to-face session,
either individually or as part of a group. While a component of some interventions, telephone counselling was
used only as an adjunct to face-to-face counselling and
was not offered as a convenient medium for advice.
Cessation counselling that is delivered entirely by telephone holds considerable promise as a relatively inexpensive means to deliver individual advice that also can be
flexible and tailored to individual needs. Telephone counselling has been shown to increase quit rates significantly
compared with minimal or usual care when provided
'reactively' in response to a smoker's contact with a quitline or as an adjunct to hospital-initiated programs
[18,19] and has been recommended by several national
guidelines for tobacco control [4,20-22].
A recent Cochrane Review of 29 controlled trials of 'proactive' telephone counselling reported only a modest overall
benefit however [23]. A subgroup analysis of 19 studies
found that proactive telephone cessation advice had minimal impact when provided to smokers who were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/9/16

recruited irrespective of their current intention to quit
[23]. Only three studies in this group involved recruitment of patients through primary care. The only study
that recruited smokers opportunistically did not find any
additional benefit from telephone follow up used to reinforce physician advice, regardless of the intensity of that
advice [24].
Thus, there remains a paucity of rigorous scientific evidence for or against opportunistic referral of smokers for
telephone-delivered smoking cessation advice. As practice
nurses are a rarity in Australian general practice, assessment of the acceptability to patients of referral to a nurse
for health promotion advice is particularly important. In
response, we designed this randomised trial to determine
acceptability and the effectiveness of this approach to
improve quit rates and shifts in stage-of-change in smokers after six and twelve months. We also investigated the
characteristics of smokers who consented to and completed this intervention.

Methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committees
(RPAH and Liverpool zones) of Sydney South West Area
Health Service (Protocol number X01-0034).
GP recruitment
From a list of all GPs in South Western Sydney (SWS)(n =
752), we selected 165 GPs who practised in two postcode
zones with the highest proportion of English-speaking
residents [25] and accessible to the research team. GPs
were eligible if they worked at least 24 hours per week in
this practice; estimated that at least 60% of their patients
spoke English and were in practice during the patient
recruitment period. We excluded GPs working in medical
centres with more than five GPs as continuity of care is not
a feature of these centres in the Australian health care system. During October 2003 – July 2004, eligible GPs were
approached and recruited for the study in waves, using a
step-wise approach used previously to achieve high participation rates [26]. Reception staff were briefed in the
study's requirements.
Patient recruitment
During a three week study period at each practice, all
patients aged 18–65 years attending for routine consultations were approached in the waiting room and were
given an information letter and self-administered questionnaire to complete before seeing their GP. Patients
were considered ineligible if they were unable to read or
understand the information sheet, did not speak sufficient
English, were in distress, were planning to leave Australia
during the study period or had previously been
approached. Patients who did not wish to participate were

asked to provide their age and sex to enable us to monitor
possible response bias.
The pre-consultation questionnaire ascertained routine
demographic data and self-reported smoking status. Previous Australian research has confirmed the accuracy of
self-report to be high with sensitivity and specificity of
94% [27]. Overseas studies also suggest that the validity of
self-reported smoking is high, discouraging the need for
cotinine validation [28,29]. Patients who self-reported
they were smokers were further asked about nicotine
dependence [30]; stage-of-change ('Pre-contemplation',
'Contemplation', 'Preparation') [31] and previous quit
attempts. All patients were instructed to hand their completed questionnaire to their GP at the start of the consultation.
Randomisation and study plan
We had pre-randomised questionnaires and allocated
unobtrusive marks that were meaningful only to the GPs
in order to convey group allocation. Questionnaires were
randomly ordered and coded prior to delivery to the practice by selecting sequential numbers from a computer generated random number list [32]. Patients were thereby
assigned either to intervention or control groups in the
waiting room before they consulted their GP.

GPs scanned questionnaires during the consultation to
determine smoking status and group allocation. Control
group smokers received the GP's usual care. We also provided GPs with free copies of government-sponsored quit
kits [33] to distribute to smokers in this group. Intervention group smokers received an offer from their GP of free
referral for telephone-based cessation advice from a
trained nurse. Intervention group patients who declined
referral were included in our intention-to-treat analyses
but not contacted by the nurse. Practices were visited by
research staff twice each week during the study period to
collect completed questionnaires and study logs and to
liaise with practice staff.
Intervention details
Within three days, a nurse trained in smoking cessation
[34] telephoned each patient. Our telephone-delivered
intervention, based on the '5As' approach [4,35], was
structured using an explicit protocol to ensure consistency. During the first call, smoking history, nicotine
dependence and previous quit attempts were assessed.
Smokers then were asked if they were willing to make a
quit attempt. Those who were not ready to do so received
a motivational intervention based on the '5Rs' to assist
their progression along the 'stage-of-change' continuum
[4]. Smokers who were ready to make a quit attempt were
assisted to set a specific quit date and to plan their quit
attempt. The nurse also mailed them a quit kit [33].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/9/16

Unless contra-indicated, these smokers were encouraged
to purchase nicotine replacement therapy (available in
Australia without a doctor's prescription) to manage nicotine withdrawal. Smokers who set a quit date were telephoned again on the specified quit day, then one week
and three weeks after the quit date. During these three
calls, participants were congratulated if they had quit,
were encouraged to maintain quitting and assisted in
resolving any problems arising. Relapsing smokers
received motivation advice and were encouraged to 'reframe' relapse as a learning experience for future cessation.
Behavioural and psychological outcome measures
Follow-up questionnaires were mailed at six and twelve
months. A standardised follow-up protocol was followed
to maximise return rates. After 1 month, remaining nonrespondents were asked to complete a short telephone
interview with a research assistant who was blind to their
group allocation to obtain a minimum data-set for study
outcomes.
Sample size
Based on previous research demonstrating that differences
in quit rates of over 10% can be achieved with intensive
smoking cessation interventions involving individualised
behavioural counselling and repeated follow up [4] and
assuming that baseline smoking prevalence would be
20%, we calculated that 214 smokers would be needed in
each group in order to detect a 10% difference in quit rates
at 12 months, with 80% power and 5% alpha. A pilot
study conducted in three general practices found very high
acceptance of the intervention among smokers with only
5% declining telephone assistance from a nurse [36].
Statistical analyses
Smoking status and stage-of-change for participants who
were lost to follow-up were considered to be unchanged
from baseline for the purpose of analysis. Point prevalence abstinence at six and twelve months was compared
between groups on an intention to treat basis using chisquared tests. To investigate the effect of patient sex and
baseline stage of change on intervention effectiveness,
subgroup analyses were performed. Interaction terms
between sex and group and stage-of-change and group
were created and entered into logistic regression models.
The significance of each interaction term was assessed to
determine whether the intervention effect differed among
the subgroups [37].

The proportion of participants who had made at least one
quit attempt lasting at least 24 hours and mean shift in
stage-of-change between baseline and 6 months and baseline and 12 months were compared between groups using
chi-square tests and t tests respectively [38].

Characteristics of patients in the intervention group who
were willing to be contacted by the nurse counsellor were
compared with those who declined. Logistic regression
modelling was then used to identify significant, independent predictors of those who agreed to the intervention. Similarly, predictors of smokers who completed all
of the counselling sessions were investigated. All analyses
were undertaken using SAS statistical software [32].

Results
GP recruitment
Of 67 eligible GPs in the selected two postcodes, 35
(52%) agreed to participate but five withdrew before
recruiting patients. Twenty-four (80%) participating GPs
were male and six (20%) were female; 15 (50%) were in
solo practices, 29 (97%) worked full-time. There were no
significant differences between eligible GPs who participated compared with those who did not in regard to gender (p = 1.0); working hours (p = 1.0) and working in solo
or group practice, (p = 0.8).
Patient recruitment
Of 1888 patients who were approached to participate, 472
(25%) were ineligible: poor English (n = 150); unable to
read (n = 79); cognitive impairment (n = 88); too sick (n
= 58); already been approached (n = 86); about to go
overseas (n = 2); acutely unwell (n = 9). Of 1416 eligible
patients, 1170 (83%) agreed to complete pre-consultation
questionnaires. There was no significant difference in the
mean age (41.9 versus 41.5 years, p = 0.7) or gender (p =
0.09) of those who did or did not participate. Differences
in smoking status could not be assessed as this information was unavailable for half (50%) of those who declined
participation.
Baseline characteristics of participants
Of the 1170 participating patients, 318 (27%) were smokers (Figure 1). Of these, 169 were randomly allocated to
the intervention group and 149 to the control group.
Characteristics of participants in each group are summarised in Table 1.

Patient flow through the study is summarised in Figure 1.
Five control group patients received the nursing intervention by mistake due to an administrative error. These
patients were analysed as controls according to intention
to treat principles.
Patient acceptance of the intervention
Of the 169 smokers allocated to the intervention group,
less than half (n = 76, 45%) gave consent to their GP to be
referred to a nurse. Smokers who consented were somewhat older than those who declined (mean 38 years versus 35 years, p = 0.05) and were significantly further along
the stage-of-change continuum (p = 0.003). There were no

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/9/16

other significant associations between characteristics of
participants and consent to the intervention (Table 2).
Of those 76 smokers who initially accepted nurse-delivered counselling, one was subsequently considered ineligible by the nurse in the first telephone contact due to
poor English. One smoker could not be contacted and
nine refused to proceed with the initial call. Of the
remaining 65 smokers, 4 subsequently declined any further support at the conclusion of their initial telephone
call. Sixty-one smokers completed the second call and 58
completed the third. Fifty-five smokers completed all four
calls of the intervention, representing 33% of those randomised but 72% of those who agreed to and were eligible for, telephone counselling. Among those who initially
agreed to receive the intervention, the only significant predictor of completion of all four calls was baseline stage-ofchange. Smokers who, at baseline, were in 'contemplation' had a three-fold increase in the odds (OR 2.6, 95%
CI: 0.8–8.1) and those in 'preparation' had a nine-fold
increase in the odds (OR 8.6, 95% CI: 1.7–44.4) of completing all four calls of the intervention compared with
those in 'pre-contemplation'.
Patient follow-up
Follow-up data were available at six months for 133
(79%) smokers in the intervention group and 110 (74%)
in the control group (p = 0.3). At 12 months, response
fractions were 69% (117/169) and 59% (88/149) respectively (p = 0.06).
Outcomes assessment
There were no significant differences in study outcomes
between groups at either six or 12 months (Table 3).
Logistic regression modelling demonstrated that the intervention was equally ineffective for men and women as the
interaction term for sex by group was not significant
(Table 4). Likewise, the intervention was equally ineffective for smokers who were in 'pre-contemplation', 'contemplation' or 'preparation' stages of change for smoking
cessation at the time of recruitment to the study (Table 4).
Outcomes in smokers who completed the intervention
Among the 55 smokers in the intervention group who
completed all four calls of the intervention, point prevalence abstinence rates at six and 12 months were 16% (9/
55) and 13% (7/55) respectively. At six months, 27 (49%)
of these smokers had made at least one quit attempt lasting 24 hours or more but the mean stage shift from baseline stage of change was zero. At 12 months, only 18
(33%) recalled having made a quit attempt lasting at least
24 hours in the previous year, and there was a mean stage
of change shift of 0.17.

GP smoking cessation advice
Among participants who completed follow-up questionnaires at six months, 80/104 (77%) in the intervention
group and 68/86 (79%) in the control group had consulted their GP since the baseline consultation (p = 0.7).
Recall of smoking cessation advice from their GP during
these consultations is summarised by group in Table 5.

Discussion
The impact of any intervention is predicated not only
upon its efficacy but also its reach and uptake among the
target population [39]. Despite designing a smoking cessation intervention that was based on the best available
scientific evidence, this randomised trial failed to demonstrate significant improvement in smokers' cessation rates
or intention to quit smoking when the intervention was
offered opportunistically for patients attending routine
consultations in general practice. Among smokers in the
intervention group, less than half accepted the offer of
referral for telephone-based assistance from a nurse. Only
one-third persisted with the intervention.
There is a considerable body of literature that has identified specific smoking cessation strategies that clinicians

should use in order to maximise the efficacy of their
smoking cessation advice [4,20,22]. Thus, the challenge
for tobacco control research is not so much to determine
which specific strategies to use, but rather how this knowledge can be implemented to assist the greatest number of
smokers in the community. Identification of, and intervention with, smokers attending general practice is as yet
an underutilised strategy both in Australia and elsewhere
[7-10]. An intervention that capitalises on the reach of
general practice to identify smokers but which delegates
the time consuming counselling required to another
health profession would seem ideal in theory. Regrettably,
this was not confirmed. Our results also are consistent
with those of the trial undertaken by Ockene and colleagues more than a decade ago in the United States that
failed to demonstrate any benefit of telephone counselling as an adjunct to opportunistic physician advice [24].
Previous studies that have shown positive benefits from
telephone cessation counselling have predominantly
reflected the results that can be achieved with more motivated smokers who actively are seeking such advice
through a helpline or who have been deemed eligible to
be offered the intervention on the basis of their current

was to provide an intervention for any smoker, regardless
of their current quit intentions, so as to move all smokers
along the stage-of-change continuum towards complete
cessation. It was hypothesised that as a number of unsuccessful attempts usually are needed before a person successfully quits, any improvement in intention to quit
would signify a measure of success that could improve the
chances of successful cessation in the future. While stage
of change as measured in this study may not accurately
predict future smoking status, it was disappointing that
the intervention had no measurable impact on smokers'
stated intentions, even in the short term.
One explanation for the lack of demonstrable benefit in
this trial was the lower than anticipated acceptance of the
intervention by smokers. Only 45% of those offered referral accepted even the first call by the nurse, and only onethird of the intervention group completed all four calls of
the intervention. While smokers who were more motivated to quit were significantly more likely to accept and
complete the intervention, motivated smokers were no
more likely to actually quit than similarly motivated
smokers in the control group as the intervention was
equally ineffective regardless of patients' baseline stage of
change. Among those smokers who completed the intervention, six and twelve month quit rates of 16% and 13%
were achieved but the absence of a comparable control
group precludes interpretation of these findings as a measure of intervention effectiveness. Future studies could
investigate the impact of the intervention among the subgroup of more motivated smokers attending general practice.
Patients in the control group received 'usual care' from
their GP. Based on previous research that consistently has
demonstrated minimal smoking cessation advice from
GPs to smokers during routine consultations [8,9], it is
probable that control group patients received, at best, a

recommendation to stop smoking and the provision of a
'Quit Kit' to take home. Unfortunately it was not possible
to monitor consultations directly as this study was undertaken in non-academic family practices where a requirement to tape consultations would likely have
considerably reduced GPs' willingness to take part in the
trial. If GPs had inadvertently 'compensated' for patients
being allocated to the control group by providing a greater
level of advice to these individuals, this could also go
some way towards explaining the lack of apparent benefit
of the nursing intervention. However, there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in
patients' recall of smoking cessation advice in subsequent
consultations so it does not appear that GPs differentially
provided greater follow up about smoking cessation for
those in the control group.
We acknowledge a number of other limitations to this
study. Given the lower than expected uptake of the intervention, statistical power was compromised but our data
can be used in future meta-analyses. A much larger study
is needed to provide a definitive assessment of this intervention. Given the low rates of acceptance of the intervention among smokers however, future studies also ought
focus on the identification and provision of intensive support for the subgroup who are motivated to quit. Additional strategies are needed to motivate those smokers
who are not yet ready to make a quit attempt. The assumption that all those lost to follow up were continuing smokers is plausible but could have biased the results towards
a null finding. We acknowledge considerable debate
about the advantages and disadvantages of cotinine validation of self-reported smoking status [28,29]. Yet a
requirement for cotinine validation would likely have further increased loss to follow up, with little gain in measurement accuracy.

Conclusion
This randomised trial failed to demonstrate any impact of
opportunistic referral of smokers for telephone-delivered
smoking cessation advice by a nurse on subsequent quit
rates or smokers' stage of change. Given the lack of evidence to date in support of this approach, it cannot yet be
recommended unequivocally.
