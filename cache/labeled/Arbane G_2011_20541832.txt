Deterioration in exercise tolerance and impairment in quality of life (QoL) are common consequences
of lobectomy. This study evaluates additional exercise and strength training after lung resection on QoL,
exercise tolerance and muscle strength. <n>Fifty-three</n> (28 male) patients attending thoracotomy for lung
cancer, mean age, range 64 (32–82) years; mean pack years (SD) 31.9 (26.8); BMI 25.6 (4.2); FEV1 2.0
(0.7) l were randomised to control (usual care) or intervention (twice daily training plus usual care). After
discharge the intervention group received monthly home visits and weekly telephone calls, the control
group received monthly telephone calls up to 12 weeks. Assessment pre-operatively, 5 day and 12 weeks
post-operatively consisted of quadriceps strength using magnetic stimulation, 6 Minute Walking Distance
(6MWD) and QoL-EORTC-QLQ-LC13. QoL was unchanged over 12 weeks; 6MWD showed signiﬁcant deterioration at 5 days post-operatively compared with pre-operatively, mean difference (SD)−131.6 (101.8)
m and −128.0 (90.7) m in active and control groups respectively (p = 0.89 between groups) which returned
to pre-operative levels by 12 weeks in both groups. Quadriceps strength over the 5 day in-patient period
showed a decrease of −8.3 (11.3) kg in the control group compared to increase of 4.0 (21.2) kg in the
intervention group (p = 0.04 between groups). Strength training after thoracotomy successfully prevented
the fall in quadriceps strength seen in controls, however, there was no effect on 6MWD or QoL. 6MWD
returned to pre-operative levels by 12 weeks regardless of additional support offered.

1. Introduction
Annually, around 18,200 men and 13,125 women are diagnosed
with lung cancer, which account for 14.8% and 11.3% of all cancers
respectively in England. Of those 1 in 5 patients will be suitable for
surgery. Statistics for 2007 showed that lung cancer accounted for
21% of all cancer deaths and 6% of all deaths [1]. Of those diagnosed
with lung cancer only 7% of men and 9% of women will survive at 5
years [2]. Surgery aims to prolong life and improve quality of life for
people with lung cancer. Increasingly, in this population, long-term
survivor issues [3] and risk of disability associated with surgery
have been highlighted as important patient focussed outcomes
[4]. Unfortunately there are few strategies presently available that
address long-term functional capacity.
Handy et al. in a longitudinal study of 139 patients undergoing
lung resection showed signiﬁcant decline in physical functioning,

role and social functioning and mental health 6 months postsurgery [5]. Compared with previously published normative data
from the Short Form 16 (SF16), pain and quality of life were signiﬁcantly worse in the lung cancer patients. Respiratory symptoms
remain problematic for many survivors of lung cancer, dyspnoea
in particular is associated with impairment in quality of life at 5
years post-surgery [6]. Rehabilitation strategies in people with dyspnoea due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have
shown positive effects on quality of life, exercise capacity and muscle strength [7] and yet there are few trials testing this approach
post-lung resection.
Spruit et al. [8] in an uncontrolled trial, examined the role of an
in patient 8 week programme of exercise 3 months after surgery.
Their encouraging pilot data results support the notion of positive
impact of rehabilitation in people with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Similarly Cesario et al., in an observational study, showed
reductions in breathlessness after a 4 week in-patient exercise programme for self selected subjects immediately post-operatively
[9]. Exercise programmes facilitate improvements in quality of life
via a number of mechanisms; improvements in fatigue [10], in

breathlessness [9]; exercise tolerance and muscle strength will contribute to improved role and social functioning [11]. Furthermore
since deterioration in quality of life after lung resection is associated with deterioration in cardio-respiratory ﬁtness [12]. There
is a strong rationale for the development of further rehabilitation
support post-surgery.
The aim of this randomised controlled trial therefore is to test
the effectiveness of a strength and mobility training programme
provided early after lung resection on quality of life, exercise tolerance and muscle strength.

of discharge and once monthly for 3 visits in total (12 weeks postoperative), patients were followed up at home where they were
encouraged to continue with their paced exercise programme (usually walking in the park or nearby streets) and an adapted home
strengthening programme. Home visits were individualised and
relevant to patient hobbies (for instance one session was at the
golf range for one patient). The control group received monthly
telephone calls from the research team, providing education only.

2. Methods

Subjects’ weight (kg) and height (cm) were taken and BMI
was calculated (weight/height2 ). Forced expiratory volume in
1 s (FEV1 )l recordings were performed using calibrated portable
spirometer ‘Microloop’ model with the patient seated, the best of
3 measures were taken.

2.1. Patients
Full ethical approval was received from Wandsworth Ethics
Committee. Sixty-seven patients undergoing lung resection for
NSCLC were invited to take part in the study, 53 of these accepted
and gave written and oral consent.

2.7. Assessments

2.8. Exercise tolerance

Patients with NSCLC referred for lung resection via open thoracotomy or Visual Assisted Thoracotomy (VATs).

Exercise tolerance was assessed using the 6 Minute Walking
Test (6MWT): an un-paced walking test in which the patient walks
between two markers set 30 m apart across a ﬂat surface, covering as much ground as possible in 6 min [13]. The better of two
repeatable tests was recorded.

2.3. Exclusion criteria

2.9. Quadriceps muscle strength

Patients undergoing thoracotomy procedure where no lung
resection is carried out (e.g. pleurectomy), patients undergoing
pneumonectomy, admission greater than 48 h to Intensive Care
Unit post-surgery.

The assessment of muscular function by magnetic stimulation
is well established and widely used [14–16]. This system used
a Strainstall ‘Junior Load Cell’ (Strainstall UK Ltd., Cowes, Isle Of
Wight) to measure applied force. The load cell was ﬁxed between
an electrically adjustable couch and a non-compliant strap around
the patient’s ankle. Force data was collected using a DSJ1 ‘Load Cell
Digitiser Module’ (Mantracourt Electronics Ltd., Exeter, England)
interfaced to a PC COM port. The femoral nerve was stimulated
using a ‘Magstim 2002’ (Magstim Company Ltd., Whitland, Wales)
with a double 70 mm B.I. style coil. Calibration was achieved using
an 8:1 ratio lever system, enabling the use of a 5 kg mass to provide
a 40 kg force. Patients were supine on the couch with their knees at
a 90◦ angle over the edge and the best of three measurements was
recorded (kg). Twitch interpolation was used to ensure maximal
quadriceps strength was achieved.

2.2. Inclusion criteria

2.4. Block randomisation
It was performed using computer generated tables after participants had consented and prior to any formal testing. The
randomisation codes were kept by an independent member of the
team and released after consent. Study was single blinded with the
therapist performing assessments unaware of the randomisation
although weekend treatments meant that in about 10 participants
the same therapist performed the assessment and treatment.
2.5. Control group

2.10. Quality of life
Control group received all usual care, pain medication as relevant was provided via patient controlled analgesia (PCA) day 1
post-operative, thereafter orally as relevant. Usual care included
routine physiotherapy treatments, airway clearance techniques,
mobilisation as able and upper limb activities and was provided
at least once daily from day 1 post-surgery.
2.6. Active group
Active group received usual care including pain relief as for the
control group, plus twice daily additional strength and mobility
training from day 1 post-operative through to day 5 post-operative
and a further 12 week programme of home support. Additional inpatient sessions were provided by research physiotherapy staff and
consisted of walking, as able, marching on the spot and recumbent bike exercises (carried out at bedside). Each patient worked
between 60% and 80% of their maximal heart rate (using 220 − age
determined maximum) for at least 5 min up to a maximum of
10 min per exercise with constant monitoring of arterial oxygen
saturation (SpO2 ) and heart rate. Patients performed seated leg
raises with 2 lb ankle weights progressing to 4 lb. Within 2 weeks

Quality of life was assessed using the following questionnaire
EORTC QLQ-CL13-(version 2.O). The EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) is an integrated system for assessing the health related
quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients participating in international
clinical trials and devised through collaborative research [17]. Also
included as an additional page was QLQ-LC13 speciﬁcally designed
to cover a wide range of lung cancer patients varying in disease
stage and treatment modality [18]. Single-item measures and the
scales range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents
a higher response level. A high score for a functional scale represents ‘a high/healthy level of functioning’, a high score for the global
health status/quality of life represents a ‘high QoL’, however a high
score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of ‘symptomatology/problems’. Quality of life was not reassessed at 5 days
post-operatively as this did not reﬂect an individual’s usual state.

2.12. Reassessment
Reassessment of 6MWT and Quadriceps strength were made at
5 days post-operatively (T2), at 12 weeks post-operatively (T3), full
assessments were performed including measures of quality of life.
2.13. Sample size calculation
Based on mean EORTC QLQ-LC13: 61.6 (22.9) [19] and assuming
a “moderate change” [20] of 20 points 21 patients in each group
were needed to show a difference at power of 80% and p < 0.05.
Fig. 1. Consort ﬂow chart showing patient recruitment.

2.14. Statistical analysis
For the primary outcome measure, QoL, data were normally
distributed and differences between control and active group for
change in QoL from pre-operative (T1) to 12 weeks post-operative
(T3) were tested for using unpaired t tests. Paired t tests were used
to test for change over time. For other outcomes, repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out where subjects
performed all assessments [21]. Where there was a group effect
unpaired t test was performed to test for differences. All analyses
were performed using SPSS 16 and p < 0.05 was taken as signiﬁcant.
3. Results
Two participants were lost after randomisation (Fig. 1), data
is therefore analysed on 51 subjects. Table 1 shows the baseline
characteristics for the participants. There were no signiﬁcant differences in baseline measures between groups at the start of the
study. Of the active, 15 were categorised at stages 1, 6 were stages
2, 2 at stages 3, 3 data unavailable (other diagnosis on surgical intervention). Of the control patients, 10 were at stages 1, 6 at stages 2,
5 at stages 4 and 4 other.

3.1. Length of stay, surgical intervention and post-operative
complications (POC)
The mean length of stay (SD) was 8.9 (3.3) and 11.0 (8.9) days
for the active and control groups respectively. For the majority
of subjects open thoracotomy was performed (only 2 patients
were treated with VATs). All patients were treated with lobectomy,
pnemonectomy patients were excluded from the study. There were
2 apriori deﬁned POCs in the active group and 3 in the control group.
Differences between the groups were not signiﬁcant for either outcome.

3.2. Quality of life
For the primary outcome measure of health related quality of
life, sufﬁcient numbers of subjects provided pre- and 12 week postoperative data. There were no signiﬁcant changes for any measure
of quality of life, either within subjects or between groups (Table 2).

3.3. Exercise tolerance
There was a signiﬁcant deterioration in 6 Minute Walk Distance
at 5 days post-operatively compared with pre-operatively which
then returned to pre-operative levels by 12 weeks post-operatively
in both groups (Fig. 2). Repeated measures analysis showed change
over time within subjects (p < 0.001) but no difference between
groups (p = 0.47) or group time interaction (p = 0.89) (Table 3).

(Table 3). Paired t tests showed a signiﬁcant fall of 8.3 (11.3) kg
and a non-signiﬁcant improvement of 4.0 (21.2) kg in the control and active groups respectively from pre-operative to 5 days
post-operative (p < 0.05) (Table 4). The difference between groups
for change in muscle strength from pre-operative to 5 days was
signiﬁcant (p = 0.04), however the difference between groups for
change in quadriceps from baseline to 12 weeks was not signiﬁcant
(Fig. 3).
4. Discussion

3.4. Quadriceps strength
Missing data for this outcome meant that repeated measures
analysis was performed on 13 control subjects and 17 active subjects only. There was no effect over time within subjects p = 0.70;
or time and group within subjects p = 0.38; but there was a signiﬁcant group effect between subjects in the overall mean p = 0.04

This is the ﬁrst randomised controlled trial to evaluate the
effects of additional exercise therapy after lobectomy on quality
of life. In this study patients were randomised to additional exercise after surgery with once monthly home follow up to 12 weeks.
For quality of life, using a disease speciﬁc validated tool, we found
no change pre-operative to 12 weeks post-operative either over

time or between groups. Like others who used EORTC [22] we were
reassured to see little deterioration in quality of life after lobectomy.
Although our ﬁndings differ from that of Handy et al. [5], differences
in tools (generic versus disease speciﬁc) populations and extent
of surgical resection make comparisons difﬁcult. Increasingly it is
recognised that surgical options provide the best outcome for lung
cancer where suitable. Importantly these data provide support that
surgical interventions are not unduly associated with deterioration
in quality of life.
As in other studies [23,24] we show a deterioration in walking distance post-surgery. Since ventilatory impairment is thought
to be the major limitation to exercise tolerance after lung resection
[25,26], our intervention, focussed as it was on muscle strength, was
not expected to ameliorate this immediate fall, however, we had
hoped to see longer term beneﬁts of the additional home support.
We cannot rule out the possibility of a ceiling effect in our measurement of exercise tolerance. The use of a relatively low intensity 6
Minute Walk Distance may have obscured differences evident if
assessed using maximal oxygen consumption. In this study, additional exercise was compared to that of usual care which included
routine daily physiotherapy but no difference in exercise tolerance
was observed between groups. There is the potential of contamination since control and active subjects were on the same ward
and the research process may have inﬂuenced usual care. In both
groups exercise tolerance had recovered to pre-operative levels
by 12 weeks post-surgery, with no apparent effect of home visits. A further limitation of our study is the relatively minimal home
service provided and the lack of adherence data concerning home
exercise makes this ﬁnding difﬁcult to interpret. It does however
provide reassurance that routine care in the UK is presently sufﬁcient to enable patients to return to previous levels of exercise
tolerance after uncomplicated lobectomy. In concordance with our
ﬁndings Sivakumar and Maiya Arun report a return to pre-operative
exercise tolerance by 4 weeks post-operatively, although in their
small study patients who received additional mobilisation showed
greater recovery [23].
In contrast to our data Cesario et al. showed an improvement
in exercise tolerance after a rehabilitation programme, however
patients were self selected and only 21 of a possible 211 agreed to
participate [9]. Furthermore the rehabilitation of Cesario’s group
consisted of a 4 week in-patient exercise programme, a substantially more intensive programme than ours. Importantly, those that
agreed to participate in Cesario’s rehabilitation programme had signiﬁcantly impaired walking distance and lung function at baseline,
suggesting that this may be an appropriate sub-group of patients
who will beneﬁt from additional rehabilitation. Although anecdotally our patients appreciated the additional support, providing
extra care may be unnecessary in “routine” cases. In addition, in
our study, patients with pneumonectomy, those known to suffer
greater impairment after surgery [27], were excluded.
This study is the ﬁrst to measure quadriceps strength pre- and
post-operatively after lobectomy for NSCLC. We observed a signiﬁcant deterioration in quadriceps strength in the control group
whilst strength was maintained in the intervention group. This
ﬁnding is best considered in the context of data from Bolliger et al.
who showed that much of the limitation in exercise capacity after
lobectomy can be accounted for by peripheral muscle fatigue [29].
Furthermore the ﬁnding of muscle weakness during an in-patient
stay is in accordance with data from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [28] and in COPD subjects, muscle
strength is known to be associated with mortality [28]. Whilst the
percentage of patients with a diagnosis of COPD was higher in the
control group compared with the active group (4% versus none)
there were no differences in spirometry values between groups at
baseline. Pre-existing lung disease such as COPD provides increased
risk factor for lung cancer [30,31], however, there is increased dif-

233

ﬁculty in diagnosing lung cancer in-patients with COPD due to
similar and overlapping symptoms. In this study severity of respiratory symptoms were low as evidenced by low breathlessness
scores post-walking test.
In this study we chose to measure quadriceps strength using
magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve in order to overcome any
motivational limitation at 5 day post-operatively. However, for this
outcome there was a large number of missing data points. Patients
were excluded on safety grounds if metal implants were present
(e.g. hip replacements) and a number of patients were unwilling
to repeat quadriceps strength testing. Repeated measures analysis was used since it is robust to missing data and this showed
a signiﬁcant effect of group. Unpaired t tests conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant difference in change in quadriceps during the in-patient period
between groups with deterioration in the control group which was
not present in the active group. However, in the absence of further
clinically relevant changes it is difﬁcult to interpret the long-term
consequence of this. Whilst cost effectiveness was not an outcome
of this study it would be difﬁcult to argue in favour, at this present
stage, of additional physiotherapy (over and above that of usual care
consisting of daily physiotherapy). Post-operative complications
were low in both groups supporting usual care.
Future studies in this ﬁeld should clearly deﬁne the long-term
complications associated with lung resection and identify whether
there are patients in whom problems persist. Data from this study
do not support further interventions, but neither do they rule out
possible beneﬁt of additional support for selected patients nor for
those after pneumonectomy.
