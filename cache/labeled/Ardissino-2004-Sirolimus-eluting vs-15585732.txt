THEROSCLEROTIC LESIONS OF

small coronary arteries are
frequently found in patients
undergoing revascularization.1-5 However, the revascularization of small coronary arteries is a problem for bypass surgery because it is
technically difficult and associated with
a high failure and mortality rate6,7 and
for percutaneous coronary revascularization because it is associated with high
rates of acute complications and restenosis after standard balloon angioplasty1-3 and stent implantation.4,5
It has been shown that sirolimuseluting stents reduce angiographic restenosis and improve the rate of eventfree survival in patients who have
coronary artery disease and are at low
risk of restenosis.8 More recent reports
For editorial comment see p 2777.

Context Percutaneous coronary revascularization of small vessels is associated with
a high restenosis rate. Sirolimus-eluting stents reduce restenosis in simple and previously untreated lesions of large coronary arteries, but their outcomes in small vessels
have not been adequately investigated.
Objective To determine whether sirolimus-eluting stents are associated with a reduced 8-month rate of angiographic restenosis in comparison with an uncoated stent.
Design, Setting, and Patients This was a randomized, multicenter, single-blind,
prospective trial performed with <n>257</n> patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization for ischemic heart disease, and who had a previously untreated atherosclerotic lesion located in a small segment with a diameter of 2.75 mm or less, in
20 Italian centers between August 2002 and December 2003.
Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive a sirolimus-eluting stent
(129 patients) or an uncoated stent having an identical architecture and radiographic
appearance (128 patients).
Main Outcome Measures The primary end point was the 8-month binary insegment restenosis rate; secondary end points included procedural success and the
8-month rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.
Results The mean (SD) reference diameter of the treated segment was 2.2(0.28)
mm; the lesion length, 11.84(6.15) mm. After 8 months, the binary in-segment restenosis rate was 53.1% (60/113) in the patients receiving an uncoated stent and 9.8%
(12/123) in those receiving a sirolimus-eluting stent (relative risk [RR], 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.32; PϽ.001). Fewer patients randomized to sirolimuseluting stents experienced major adverse cardiac events (12/129 [9.3%] vs 40/128
[31.3%]; RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.15-0.55; PϽ.001) mainly because of a reduction in target lesion revascularization (9/129 [7%] vs 27/128 [21.1%]; RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.140.70; P = .002) and myocardial infarction (2/129 [1.6%] vs 10/129 [7.8%]; RR, 0.20;
95% CI, 0.01-0.93; P=.04).
Conclusion The use of sirolimus-eluting stents to treat atherosclerotic lesions in small
coronary arteries reduces restenosis and may also reduce major adverse cardiac events.

have also shown the efficacy of drugeluting stents under more challenging
conditions such as long and complex lesions, and post hoc analyses of trial subpopulations suggest that drug-eluting
stents may also effectively prevent restenosis in small vessels.9-11
This randomized, multicenter, prospective trial was designed to test the
hypothesis that the implantation of a
sirolimus-eluting stent in small coronary arteries is associated with a reduced 8-month rate of angiographic
restenosis in comparison with the implantation of an uncoated stent having an identical architecture.
METHODS

tients could have had single-vessel or
multivessel disease but, in the latter
case, had to have the nonrandomized
lesion located in other coronary vessels.
Major exclusion criteria were recent ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (within the previous 15
days), severe calcifications or thrombuscontaining lesions, a left ventricular
ejection fraction less than 30%, and
known allergies to aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, heparin, stainless steel,
contrast agents, or sirolimus. The study
protocol was approved by the ethics
committee of each participating center, and all patients gave written informed consent.

Patients

Randomization and Interventions

Eligible patients had to be aged 18 years
or older, with a documented diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (without persistent ST-segment elevation),
stable angina pectoris, or silent myocardial ischemia as shown by exercise
stress test. Additional eligibility criteria were the presence of a single, previously untreated 50% to 99% target lesion in a native coronary artery 2.75
mm in diameter or less, which could be
completely covered by a single stent
(maximum length, 33 mm). The pa-

Online quantitative coronary angiography confirming vessel diameter and
lesion-length enrollment criteria was
performed before randomization. An
automated telephone randomization
system was used to assign the patients
to treatment with a sirolimus-eluting
stent (Cypher balloon-expandable stent;
Cordis, Miami Lakes, Fla) or an uncoated stent of identical architecture
and radiographic appearance (Bx Sonic
balloon-expandable stent; Cordis), in
a 1:1 ratio according to a centralized list.

The randomization list was generated
for a completely randomized design, ie,
without blocks or stratification factors, using the SAS PLAN (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) procedure. The investigators had to digitize patient date
of birth, site number, vessel size, and
stent length by means of an interactive voice recording system to obtain the
assigned treatment. Data were confirmed by fax, which was included in
the case report form.
Diameters of both types of stents
were 2.25, 2.50, and 2.75 mm, and
lengths were 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, and 33
mm. The 2 types of stents were visually and angiographically indistinguishable. The lesions were treated by using standard interventional techniques,
including mandatory balloon dilatation before stent placement.
Before the index procedure, all patients received oral aspirin once daily and
clopidogrel (a loading dose of 300 mg at
least 2 hours before the procedure). Patients who had been pretreated with ticlopidine (250 mg twice a day) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) for at least 72
hours did not receive a clopidogrel loading dose. During the procedure, heparin was given as a bolus at 70 U/kg, with
additional boluses to maintain an activated clotting time of more than 250 seconds. The use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors was encouraged but left to the
discretion of the attending physician.
Heparin administration was discontinued immediately after the procedure.
A 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained before the procedure, immediately afterward, and 24 hours later or
at discharge if earlier. Cardiac enzymes creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB
were evaluated twice within 8 to 16 and
18 to 24 hours of the procedure or at
hospital discharge if earlier. Discharged patients received a regimen of
aspirin (100 mg once daily indefinitely) and clopidogrel (75 mg once
daily for at least 2 months). All patients were clinically followed up after
1 and 8 months by the trial coordinator at each site. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed after a mean
(SD) of 8(0.5) months.

DRUG-ELUTING VS UNCOATED STENTS TO PREVENT RESTENOSIS
Quantitative Coronary
Angiography

Coronary angiograms obtained at baseline, on completion of the stenting procedure, and after 8 months were analyzed with a computer-based algorithm
developed by MEDIS (version 5.1)
(MEDIS, Medical Imaging System,
Leiden, the Netherlands). The projection that best showed the stenosis in its
tightest view was used for all angiograms; all details of the angiographic procedure were recorded in the case report
forms. For standardization, each angiogram sequence was preceded by an intracoronary injection of 200 µg of nitroglycerin. Quantitative angiographic
analyses were performed by 1 experienced cardiologist who was blinded to
the patient’s identity, type of stent used,
outcome, and film sequence. The minimal luminal diameter (MLD) and the
nearest normal reference diameter
(RVD) were measured in millimeters by
using the catheter as a scaling factor. Percentage of stenosis was calculated as 100
(1 − MLD/RVD). Binary restenosis was
defined as a stenosis of more than 50%
of the MLD in the target lesion at angiographic follow-up. Acute gain was
defined as the difference between the
MLD after stent implantation and baseline MLD. Late luminal loss was defined
as the difference between the MLD at the
end of the stenting procedure and that
measured during follow-up. The late loss
index was defined as late loss divided by
acute gain. Quantitative angiographic
measurements of the target lesion were
obtained in the “in-stent” zone (including only the stent segment) and in the
“in-segment” zone (including the stented
segment and the 5-mm margins proximal and distal to the stent); intraobserver and interobserver variabilities of
the quantitative assessments have been
previously reported.12
Outcomes

The primary end point of the study was
the 8-month angiographic binary insegment restenosis rate. Secondary end
points were procedural success,
8-month in-segment MLD, late luminal loss, late loss index, and major ad-

verse cardiac and cerebrovascular
events. Procedural success was defined as the achievement of a residual
in-stent stenosis of less than 30% associated with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 3 flow, in the absence of
a dissection of more than D1, a grade
according to the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute classification,
without the occurrence of death, myocardial infarction, or repeated target lesion revascularization during hospitalization. Major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events were defined as

cardiac death, myocardial infarction (Q
wave and non–Q wave), cerebrovascular accident, emergency or elective coronary artery bypass grafting, or emergency or elective repeated percutaneous
transluminal coronary intervention of
the target lesion. All deaths were considered cardiac unless an unequivocal
noncardiac cause could be established. Q-wave myocardial infarction
was defined as the occurrence of prolonged chest pain with an increase in the
CK-MB fraction of more than 3 times the
upper normal limit and the develop-

Q-wave myocardial infarction was defined as the absence of the latter. Target
lesion revascularization was defined as
repeated emergency or elective percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention or emergency or elective coronary artery bypass grafting performed
because of restenosis of the target lesion in association with angina, objective evidence of myocardial ischemia, or
both. A cerebrovascular accident was defined as the sudden onset of vertigo,
numbness, aphasia, or dysarthria persisting for more than 24 hours.
Stent thrombosis was defined as an
angiographic thrombus within the
stented vessel at a clinically driven angiographic restudy for documented
myocardial ischemia.
All major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and stent thrombosis were determined for the in-

hospital period, from hospital discharge
up to 8 months, and cumulatively for
all of the 8-month follow-up period;
they were assessed by an independent
clinical events committee unaware of
treatment assignment.
Statistical Methods

On the basis of the available data concerning the restenosis rate in small arteries, it was calculated that the sample
size required to demonstrate a 66% reduction in restenosis (from 30% to 10%)
by means of a 2-sided test with an ␣ error of .05 and a ␤ error of .10 was 103
patients per group. To compensate for
unsuccessful interventions and losses to
follow-up, the sample size was increased by 25% to 128 patients per group.
The continuous variables were compared between groups by using the t test.
Categorical variables were compared using the ␹2 test. The binary study end

points were analyzed using the Fisher
exact test; the relative risks or odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) are also reported. All of the statistical analyses were performed using SAS
software (version 6.12; SAS Institute) on
the basis of the intention-to-treat principle, ie, the primary analysis included
all of the patients randomized to 1 of the
2 treatments and for whom follow-up
coronary angiography was available, regardless of treatment actually received.
Because of some imbalances in baseline characteristics, the main study results were confirmed by means of stratified analyses and by multivariable
logistic regression analysis. Differences were considered statistically significant at PϽ.05 (2 tailed).
RESULTS
The trial profile is shown in FIGURE 1.
Between August 2002 and February
2003, 260 patients were enrolled in 20
Italian centers. Three patients were not
randomized because of the discovery of
exclusion criteria that became apparent
only after enrollment. The final patient
cohort therefore included 257 patients:
129 in the sirolimus-eluting stent group
and 128 in the uncoated stent group.
Characteristics of the patients, lesions, and procedures are reported in
T ABLES 1 and 2. The groups were
generally well matched in terms of patient and lesion characteristics; however, the patients treated with sirolimuseluting stents had longer target lesions
and therefore received longer stents.
Procedural success rates were excel-

Minimal luminal diameter and percentage of stenosis diameter at baseline

DRUG-ELUTING VS UNCOATED STENTS TO PREVENT RESTENOSIS

duction of risk of restenosis with the
sirolimus-eluting stent in comparison
with the uncoated stent was independent of sex, diabetes mellitus status,
clinical presentation (acute coronary
syndrome vs chronic stable angina or
silent myocardial ischemia), epicardial vessel location, stent diameter, and
stent length (FIGURE 3). Similarly, in
a multivariable logistic regression
model, treatment with a sirolimuseluting stent was associated with a
markedly lower rate of restenosis (adjusted odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.050.24; PϽ.001).
The major in-hospital, out-ofhospital, and cumulative 8-month adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event
rates are listed in TABLE 4. There were 2
deaths in the uncoated stent group (one
caused by pneumonia and the other by
stroke followed by pneumonia) and none
in the sirolimus stent group. The cumulative frequency of myocardial infarction was lower in the sirolimus stent
group (relative risk, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.010.93; P=.04). Target lesion revascularization was performed less frequently in
the patients receiving sirolimus-eluting
stents (relative risk, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.140.70; P=.002). Major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events were less frequently observed in the sirolimus stent
group (relative risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.150.55; PϽ.001). Stent thrombosis was infrequent and occurred in 2 patients dur-

ing hospital stay, 1 in the sirolimus stent
group and 1 in the uncoated stent group;
out-of-hospital stent thrombosis occurred in 3 of the patients receiving the
uncoated stents and in none of the sirolimus stent group (relative risk, 0.26;
95% CI, 0.1-2.3). One of the non–Qwave myocardial infarctions that occurred during hospitalization in the sirolimus stent group was clearly unrelated
to the target lesion, as was the related
stent thrombosis.
COMMENT
Percutaneous coronary revascularization by means of balloon angioplasty has
a lower primary success rate and a higher
restenosis rate in small coronary arteries than in large vessels.1-3 Restenosis in
small coronary arteries may be as high
as 50%, as an inverse relationship between vessel size and angiographic restenosis has reported.4,5 Stenting has become the major means of percutaneous
coronary revascularization because it has
been demonstrated to be superior to balloon angioplasty in preventing restenosis of new focal lesions in large coronary arteries,13,14 but conflicting results
have been reported about efficacy in
small vessels.15-20 Potential explanations for the lack of efficacy of coronary
angioplasty with or without stent implantation in preventing restenosis in
small vessels may be related to characteristics of patients harboring athero-

sclerotic small-vessel lesions, ie, women,
diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with peripheral vascular disease,
all of whom are associated with a higher
risk of restenosis.21,22 Another possible
explanation may be related to the narrow diameter of the vessels, which cannot accommodate even minimal neointimal hyperplasia after angioplasty or
stent deployment without becoming restenotic.
Given their ability to deliver prolonged and sufficient intramural drug
concentrations to target coronary segments, drug-eluting stents are able to dramatically reduce neointimal hyperplasia,23,24 and this specific mechanism may
be particularly useful in reducing restenosis in small coronary arteries.
The results of the present study demonstrate that the implantation of a sirolimus-eluting stent to treat atherosclerotic lesions of small coronary arteries
is safe, effective, and associated with a
lower incidence of angiographic restenosis in comparison with an uncoated
stent. Because the 2 stents had an identical architecture, the only difference between them was the release of sirolimus, which reduced the rate of
angiographic restenosis from 53.1% to
9.8%, with a relative risk reduction of
82%. The high restenosis rate observed
in the uncoated stent group may partially account for the high absolute and
relative risk reduction; however, this rate

DRUG-ELUTING VS UNCOATED STENTS TO PREVENT RESTENOSIS

of restenosis is not all that surprising,
given the high-risk population and highrisk lesions treated. Nevertheless, the
9.8% restenosis rate in the sirolimuseluting stent group is also remarkably
low. Previous post hoc analyses of the
effect of overlapping sirolimus-eluting
stents in small vessels revealed less satisfactory results (18.4% of restenosis in
vessels with an average diameter of 2.32
mm).9 The use of adequately sized single
stents that were almost 60% longer than
the lesion may explain the remarkably
low restenosis rate.
Not only was there a reduction in the
risk of angiographic restenosis but also
a lower rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, mainly because of the
decreased incidence of ischemia-driven
target-lesion revascularization and myocardial infarction. Why the implantation of a sirolimus-eluting stent may prevent the development of myocardial
infarction remains unclear and needs to
be confirmed. The beneficial effects of the
sirolimus-eluting stent were achieved
without any increase in complications,
including stent thrombosis, which is a
feared event, particularly in patients receiving stents in small vessels.
This was a single-blind, randomized
trial, and therefore the cardiologists performing the procedure knew whether the
patients were receiving a drug-eluting or
an uncoated stent. However, the risk of
a selection bias was minimized by the
completely randomized design. Furthermore, because patients and the angiographic core laboratory personnel were
blinded to the assigned treatment, symptom reporting and the angiographic results should not have been influenced by
the open-label design.
Another possible limitation is related to the comparator bare-metal stent
used. A different comparator with thinner struts might have led to a lower incidence of restenosis in the uncoated
stent group. However, our purpose was
to compare 2 angiographically indistinguishable stents with the same architecture to verify the effect of the eluting drug.
Despite these limitations, we found
that in a highly challenging condition,

namely, revascularization of small coronary arteries in patients with stable angina pectoris or acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation,
the use of sirolimus-eluting stents likely
represents an advance in the prevention of angiographic restenosis and the
short-term recurrence of adverse cardiac events. To establish their longterm efficacy and cost-effectiveness in
the treatment of small coronary arteries, extended follow-up is required.

Funding/Support: This study was largely supported
through institutional funds of the participating centers. There was complementary funding from Cordis
Italia, Milan, Italy.
Role of the Sponsor: The sponsor provided free stents
to the participating sites and was responsible for the
logistics of the trial. The sponsor had no role in the
study design, data analysis, and manuscript writing.
Independent Statistical Analysis: Drs Ardissino and
Cavallini and the contract research organization (CRO)
Mediolanum Cardiovascular Research had direct access to the raw data. The statistical analysis was performed by Erminio Bonizzoni, who is an academic statistician at the University of Milan. For this project he
worked with Fabio Bravi (another independent statistician) as consultants for Mediolanum Cardiovascular Research. The statistical analyses were made independently of the sponsor, which had no access to
the data. However, another academic statistician,
Silavano Milani, not employed by the sponsor and without any relationship with the CRO, repeated the statistical analyses and provided written confirmation that
the results are correct.
