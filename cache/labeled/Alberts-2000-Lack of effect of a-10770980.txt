ABSTRACT
Background The risks of colorectal cancer and
adenoma, the precursor lesion, are believed to be influenced by dietary factors. Epidemiologic evidence
that cereal fiber protects against colorectal cancer is
equivocal. We conducted a randomized trial to determine whether dietary supplementation with wheatbran fiber reduces the rate of recurrence of colorectal adenomas.
Methods We randomly assigned <n>1429</n> men and
women who were 40 to 80 years of age and who had
had one or more histologically confirmed colorectal
adenomas removed within three months before recruitment to a supervised program of dietary supplementation with either high amounts (13.5 g per
day) or low amounts (2 g per day) of wheat-bran fiber.
The primary end point was the presence or absence
of new adenomas at the time of follow-up colonoscopy. Subjects and physicians, including colonoscopists, were unaware of the group assignments.
Results Of the 1303 subjects who completed the
study, 719 had been randomly assigned to the highfiber group and 584 to the low-fiber group. The median times from randomization to the last follow-up
colonoscopy were 34 months in the high-fiber group
and 36 months in the low-fiber group. By the time of
the last follow-up colonoscopy, at least one adenoma
had been identified in 338 subjects in the high-fiber
group (47.0 percent) and in 299 subjects in the lowfiber group (51.2 percent). The multivariate adjusted
odds ratio for recurrent adenoma in the high-fiber
group, as compared with the low-fiber group, was 0.88
(95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.11; P=0.28),
and the relative risk of recurrence according to the
number of adenomas, in the high-fiber group as compared with the low-fiber group, was 0.99 (95 percent
confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.36; P=0.93).
Conclusions As used in this study, a dietary supplement of wheat-bran fiber does not protect against
recurrent colorectal adenomas. (N Engl J Med 2000;
342:1156-62.)

wheat-bran fiber has been shown to dilute fecal concentrations of bile acids4,5 and to bind bile acids, thereby increasing their fecal excretion.6,7 Although an inverse correlation was observed between mortality rates
from colon cancer and per capita cereal consumption,8 the results of the few analytical epidemiologic
studies of associations between the consumption of
whole-grain cereal and the risk of colorectal cancer 9-15
or adenoma16 have been equivocal. Some metabolic
end-point studies,5,17 including our own,4 have shown
that wheat-bran fiber decreases fecal mutagenicity and
reduces concentrations of fecal bile acids, although no
effect was found on rates of proliferation of rectal mucosal cells.18 Two studies found that a supplement of
wheat-bran fiber had no effect on the risk of recurrent
colorectal adenoma.19,20
In 1990, we initiated a multicenter trial to determine whether wheat-bran fiber can prevent the recurrence of colorectal adenomas.
METHODS
Study Design and Subjects
Details of the design and methods of the study have been described previously.21 Briefly, subjects were recruited between September 1990 and July 1995 from multiple centers in the Phoenix,
Arizona, metropolitan area. The study protocol was approved by
the institutional review boards of the 22 participating health care
centers in the Phoenix area and by the human-subjects committee
of the University of Arizona. All subjects provided written informed
consent.
We identified men and women who were 40 to 80 years of age
from whom one or more colorectal adenomas, measuring at least
3 mm in diameter at colonoscopy, had been removed within the
three months before recruitment. To be eligible, subjects had to
have an adequate nutritional status and normal renal and liver function and to have a Southwest Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2.22 We excluded persons who had had invasive cancer within the previous five years; those with a history of colon
resection; those who had two or more first-degree relatives with

HE risks of colorectal cancer and adenoma,
the precursor lesion, are believed to be influenced by diet.1 Burkitt’s proposal that a
high-fiber diet protects against colon cancer was based on the low rates of colorectal cancer in
Africa.2 Insoluble fibers, such as wheat-bran fiber, are
thought to protect against colon cancer by absorbing carcinogens in the gastrointestinal tract.3 Indeed,

colorectal cancer, severe metabolic disorders, or other severe illnesses; and those with an intake of more than 30 g of dietary fiber
per day on the basis of their responses to the Arizona Food-Frequency Questionnaire.23
Subjects who successfully completed a six-week run-in period
by consuming at least 75 percent of the amount of a low-fiber supplement supplied (2 g per day) were randomly assigned to receive
a high-fiber supplement (13.5 g per day) or a low-fiber supplement
(2 g per day) of wheat-bran cereal. With the exception of the cerealfiber intervention, no other dietary changes were required. The
treatment assignments were not revealed to the subjects, their physicians, or members of the study staff. The fiber supplements were
provided by Kellogg (Battle Creek, Mich.) and were available in several forms: unsweetened loop-shaped cereal and sweetened and unsweetened shredded cereal. Analysis of the fiber content per serving showed the following: high-fiber loops, 13 g; low-fiber loops,
2 g; high-fiber unsweetened shredded cereal, 13 g; low-fiber unsweetened shredded cereal, 4 g; high-fiber sweetened shredded cereal, 10 g; and low-fiber sweetened shredded cereal, 3 g. Cereal
boxes were color coded into six groups to help maintain the study
blinding. Midway through the study, high-fiber wheat-bran–fiber
bars (containing 10 g of fiber) and low-fiber bars (4 g of fiber)
were developed by Kellogg. Subjects who had completed two years
of the study were allowed to elect to consume up to 25 percent
of their daily fiber supplement in the form of a fiber bar.
Compliance with the protocol was evaluated primarily by counts
of returned cereal boxes and fiber bars at each visit and secondarily through a specialized intake calendar. Each index was used to
generate an overall compliance score; subjects who consumed more
than 75 percent of the cereal supplement were classified as complying with the protocol. On the basis of these data, members of
the clinic research staff initiated individualized measures, as necessary, to increase compliance.
Colonoscopy
The study protocol specified that follow-up colonoscopy be performed twice after the initial qualifying colonoscopy. The first colonoscopy was to take place one year after randomization (to identify and remove adenomas missed at the qualifying colonoscopy),
and the second two years thereafter. However, the national recommendations regarding the frequency of colonoscopic surveillance of patients with a history of colorectal adenomas changed during the study from one and three years after the initial resection
to three years after resection.24-26 Thus, there was a decrease in the
rate of colonoscopy at one year among subjects enrolled in the
latter part of the trial.
Data Collection
Results of endoscopy and pathological analysis were collected for
each colonoscopy reported during the study. Using standardized
guidelines, we abstracted data on the completeness of the examination and on the location, size, and histologic features of any resected adenomas.
Complete blood counts and blood chemical analyses were performed during screening and during the run-in phase of the study
and annually thereafter. Diet was assessed according to the same
schedule with use of the Arizona Food-Frequency Questionnaire,
which has been evaluated with respect to reliability and validity in
this population.27 Information on adverse events was obtained every three months at the time the dietary supplement was dispensed.
Statistical Analysis
The original trial design and approach to analysis were described in detail by Emerson et al.28 The target sample size of 1400
subjects was based on a three-year rate of recurrence of adenomas
of 40 percent and on an estimate that 10 to 15 percent of adenomas would be missed during the colonoscopy at base line. Given
a predicted dropout rate of 25 percent over a period of three years,
we estimated that 950 subjects would complete the intervention.
Given this sample size, the study had a statistical power of 0.82

to detect a 25 percent reduction in the recurrence of adenomas
and a power of 0.94 to detect a 30 percent reduction.
An interim analysis conducted in the latter part of the study
suggested a difference between groups in the proportion of subjects
who stopped taking the assigned supplement: 12.7 percent stopped
in the low-fiber group, and 23.3 percent stopped in the high-fiber
group. Therefore, for the remainder of the accrual period, the original 1:1 schedule of randomization was changed to 4:1, with four
subjects assigned to the high-fiber group for every one assigned to
the low-fiber group.
We counted all adenomas, whether detected during the first colonoscopy (at year 1) or subsequent colonoscopic examinations.
Subjects in whom an adenoma was found during the one-year colonoscopy were not withdrawn from the study. Two separate analyses were performed. The first included all subjects who underwent
colonoscopy one or more times after randomization, with recurrence defined as the identification of one or more adenomas after
randomization. The second set of analyses included only subjects
who underwent colonoscopy at one year and one or more times
thereafter. Recurrence was defined for these analyses as the identification of any adenoma after the one-year colonoscopy. Differences between the high-fiber group and the low-fiber group in the
rates of colonoscopy at one year and during follow-up were analyzed with the use of chi-square tests, and the difference between
the groups in the length of time from randomization to the last
colonoscopy was assessed with a log-rank test. Differences in characteristics and in the incidence of adverse events among patients
with recurrent adenomas in the two groups were tested with chisquare tests.
Multivariate adjustment to test for an effect of wheat-bran fiber
was initially performed with the use of logistic regression (presence
vs. absence of an adenoma). We used generalized estimating equations with a Poisson link function to model the number of recurrent adenomas at each colonoscopy, adjusting for the timing of
colonoscopy and assuming an exchangeable correlation structure
among the repeated procedures.29 Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the adjusted relative risk of the recurrence of adenomas for the high-fiber group as compared with the
low-fiber group, whereas logistic regression was used to estimate
the adjusted odds ratio (as an estimate of the adjusted relative risk).
Initial models fitted to test the effect of group assignment were
adjusted only for the randomization period. Subsequent statistical
modeling also adjusted for sex and the number of adenomas at
the base-line colonoscopy (both of which are strong predictors of
the risk of recurrence) and factors that were found to be significantly different between groups at base line. The significance of
the treatment effect was assessed with the Wald statistic.

RESULTS
Enrollment and Randomization

We identified 4705 potentially eligible subjects. Of
these, 2088 declined to participate, 1006 were found
to be ineligible, and 102 dropped out before the runin phase. The remaining 1509 subjects entered the
six-week run-in phase, which consisted of the daily
intake of a supplement low in wheat-bran fiber (2 g
per day). Of the 3699 eligible subjects, 1429 (38.6
percent) successfully completed the run-in period and
underwent randomization, 627 to the low-fiber group
and 802 to the high-fiber group.
Base-Line Characteristics of the Subjects

Table 1 shows the base-line characteristics of all
1429 randomized subjects and of the 1303 subjects
(91.2 percent) who completed the study by undergoing at least one colonoscopy after randomization.

an assessment of required calendar notations made by subjects concerning the number of cereal boxes or fiber bars consumed each day.

Compliance

We assessed compliance with the dietary-supplement regimen by two methods: a count of cereal boxes returned to the study sites and a calendar record
of consumption kept by each subject. With the ex1158 ·

ception of the first year of the study, there was a significant difference in compliance between the two
groups (Table 2): the proportion of subjects who consumed more than 75 percent of the cereal supplement was lower in the high-fiber group than in the
low-fiber group (P<0.05). Counts of returned boxes indicated that compliance declined with each year
of the study, so that by the third year, 84 percent of
the low-fiber group and 74 percent of the high-fiber
group were consuming more than 75 percent of the

and other sources, the mean total intake of fiber was

Recurrence of Adenomas

As noted in the Methods section, we changed the
randomization scheme during the latter part of the
study. As a result, 276 of the 1303 subjects underwent
randomization according to a 4:1 ratio (high fiber to
low fiber) (Table 3). We did not detect significant differences between the high-fiber and low-fiber groups
in the number of colonoscopic procedures performed

cording to either the initial 1:1 scheme or the 4:1
subsequent scheme; however, subjects who underwent
randomization during the later period underwent significantly fewer colonoscopic examinations during year
1 than those who underwent randomization during
the initial period. This difference clearly resulted from
the change in clinical screening practice.
Table 4 shows the rates of recurrent adenomas
among the 1303 subjects who completed the study.
The median observation period was 34 months in the
high-fiber group and 36 months in the low-fiber
group (P=0.006). By the time of the last follow-up
colonoscopy, the percentage of subjects with one or
more recurrent adenomas was 51.2 percent in the lowfiber group and 47.0 percent in the high-fiber group
(P=0.13). After adjustment for the randomization
scheme used, the odds ratio for the presence of at least
one recurrent adenoma in the high-fiber group, as
compared with the low-fiber group, was 0.88 (95
percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.11; P=0.28).
When the analysis was restricted to the 889 subjects who underwent both a one-year colonoscopy
and another examination two years later, the recurrence rates in the high-fiber and low-fiber groups were
not significantly different. With the use of generalized estimating equations, the relative risk in the highfiber group, as compared with the low-fiber group,
was 0.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.36;
P=0.93) for all 1303 subjects and 1.08 (95 percent
confidence interval, 0.71 to 1.64; P=0.73) for the
889 subjects who underwent colonoscopy during
year 1. Additional adjustments for sex, the number of
colonoscopic examinations, the number of adenomas
found at the base-line colonoscopy, and base-line variables that differed significantly between treatment
groups did not change the results. Separate analyses
revealed no significant differences in the rates of re-

this difference was of borderline statistical significance
(P=0.05). There was no evidence of an effect of supplementation with wheat-bran fiber among male subjects who underwent colonoscopy during the first year.

(P=0.51). However, there was a significantly higher
proportion of subjects with three or more recurrent
adenomas in the high-fiber group than in the lowfiber group (P=0.03). When subjects were classified
according to the sites of the recurrent adenomas (proximal colon or distal colon and rectum or both), the
high-fiber and low-fiber groups were significantly different (P=0.004); this result was largely due to the
higher number of subjects in the high-fiber group
who had recurrent adenomas in both the proximal
colon and distal colon and rectum.
Adverse Events

During the course of the study, nine cases of colorectal cancer were reported, two in the low-fiber
group and seven in the high-fiber group (P=0.20).
As shown in Table 6, among the 1303 subjects who
completed the study, there were 23 deaths: 10 in the
low-fiber group and 13 in the high-fiber group. There
were no significant differences between groups in the
1160 ·

occurrence of extracolonic cancer (P=0.58), cardiovascular disease (P=0.37), or stroke (P=0.69). The
number of subjects who reported gastrointestinal
effects was significantly higher in the high-fiber group
than in the low-fiber group for all effects except constipation (Table 6). Most of these adverse effects
were mild.
DISCUSSION

In this double-blind trial, we found that a dietary
supplement of wheat-bran fiber had no statistically
significant protective effect against recurrent colorectal adenomas. This finding was unchanged whether
the analysis was based on all colonoscopic procedures performed after randomization or only those
performed after one year in the study. This method
of analysis has been used in other intervention studies of recurrent colorectal adenoma.30 Moreover, the
high-dose supplement of wheat-bran fiber had no effect on the number of recurrent adenomas in subjects
who had a recurrence. Our results are consistent with
those of the Toronto Polyp Prevention Trial19 and the
Australian Polyp Prevention Project.20 Although our
secondary analyses suggested an effect of the highfiber supplement among men, this result probably represents a chance finding; in the Toronto Polyp Prevention Trial the effect of a low-fat, high-fiber diet was
greater among women than men.19 Furthermore, contrary to the findings of the Australian trial, we did not
see any evidence that the high-fiber supplement we
used reduced the rate of recurrence of large adenomas.
We observed no protective effect of the high-fiber
supplement on the number, location, or histologic fea-

tures of the recurrent adenomas. The combination
of these observations argues against the idea that dietary supplementation with wheat-bran fiber can protect against recurrent colorectal adenomas. As reported in this issue of the Journal, Schatzkin et al. found
that a low-fat, high-fiber diet also failed to lower the
risk of recurrence of colorectal adenomas.31
We observed a relatively high rate of recurrent adenomas in the proximal colon in both the low-fiber
group and the high-fiber group (48.2 percent and
41.4 percent, as compared with respective rates of
26.4 percent and 27.5 percent at base line). When
rates of recurrent adenomas in the proximal colon are
added to the rates of recurrence occurring in both
the proximal colon and the distal colon or rectum,
68.2 percent of the subjects in the low-fiber group
and 74.0 percent of those in the high-fiber group
had recurrences in the proximal colon. The high rates
of recurrent adenomas in the proximal colon strongly suggest that colonoscopy, rather than sigmoidoscopy, is the preferred method of surveillance, especially in patients with a history of adenoma in the
proximal colon.
In large, randomized clinical trials, randomization
is expected to result in a relatively equal distribution
of subjects with respect to risk factors of interest. In
our trial, there was a balanced distribution with respect to base-line age and sex, but imbalances in terms
of exposure to tobacco, alcohol consumption, and
total intake of fat. Nevertheless, the multivariate logistic-regression analysis, after adjustment for randomization period, sex, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and energy intake, did not show a significant
effect of supplementation with wheat-bran fiber on
the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. Thus, our results do not appear to be related to an imbalance in
the base-line characteristics of the subjects or to the
change in the randomization scheme from a 1:1 ratio to a 4:1 ratio in favor of the high-fiber group.
Our experience underscores the difficulty of performing large-scale nutritional intervention trials, in
terms of both recruitment and compliance with the
protocol. Of 3699 eligible subjects, 1303 (35.2 percent) successfully completed the trial. In addition, by
the third year of the study, only 74 percent of the subjects in the high-fiber group, as compared with 84
percent of those in the low-fiber group, consumed
more than 75 percent of their supplemental cereal on
a daily basis (a level we defined as indicative of compliance). Despite these difficulties, the mean intake of
total fiber was 27.5 g per day in the high-fiber group
and 18.1 g per day in the low-fiber group. It can be
argued that this level of intake over a period of three
years is inadequate to prevent recurrent adenomas;
however, our compliance data indicate that higher daily consumption of wheat-bran fiber for longer periods
is not practical in adults older than 65 years of age.
The lack of effect of three years of supplementa-

tion with wheat-bran fiber may reflect inadequate
follow-up: three years may be too short. It could be
argued that the total amount of dietary and cereal fiber consumed by the subjects in the high-fiber group
was insufficient to protect against recurrent adenomas. It is also possible that a high-fiber diet may
be beneficial only in persons with lower base-line intakes of total fiber than those in our study. Alternatively, the use of wheat-bran–fiber supplements may
only protect against the progression of large adenomas to carcinomas. However, both the Nurses’
Health Study15 and the Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study16 failed to find that cereal fiber prevents colon cancer. Since cereal fiber has potentially
healthful effects in the prevention of coronary heart
disease,32,33 public health recommendations34,35 that
emphasize increased consumption of complex carbohydrates, whole-grain foods, and cereal products
may nevertheless be appropriate.
