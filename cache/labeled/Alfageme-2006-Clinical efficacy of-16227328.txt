Background: A study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the 23-valent pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) in immunocompetent patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD).
Methods: A randomised controlled trial was carried out in <n>596</n> patients with COPD of mean (SD) age 65.8
(9.7) years, 298 of whom received PPV. The main outcome was radiographically proven community
acquired pneumonia (CAP) of pneumococcal or unknown aetiology after a mean period of 979 days
(range 20–1454).
Results: There were 58 first episodes of CAP caused by pneumococcus or of unknown aetiology, 25 in the
intervention group and 33 in the non-intervention group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for CAP did not
show significant differences between the intervention and non-intervention arms (log rank test = 1.15,
p = 0.28) in the whole group of patients. The efficacy of PPV in all patients was 24% (95% CI 224 to 54;
p = 0.333). In the subgroup aged ,65 years the efficacy of PPV was 76% (95% CI 20 to 93; p = 0.013),
while in those with severe functional obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 second ,40%) it was 48%
(95% CI 27 to 80; p = 0.076). In younger patients with severe airflow obstruction the efficacy was 91%
(95% CI 35 to 99; p = 0.002). There were only five cases of non-bacteraemic pneumococcal CAP, all in the
non-intervention group (log rank test = 5.03; p = 0.025). Multivariate analysis gave a hazard ratio for
unknown and pneumococcal CAP in the vaccinated group, adjusted for age, of 0.20 (95% CI 0.06 to
0.68; p = 0.01).
Conclusions: PPV is effective in preventing CAP in patients with COPD aged less than 65 years and in
those with severe airflow obstruction. No differences were found among the other groups of patients with
COPD.

nfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major
cause of morbidity and mortality across all age groups,
being the most common cause of community acquired
bacterial pneumonia.1 The burden of disease is greatest
among young children and the elderly. The incidence of
invasive pneumococcal disease has been estimated to be 15–
30 per 100 000 inhabitants per year in developed countries,
with the highest rates among persons older than 65 years of
age and in children aged under 2 years. In adults, pneumococcal bacteraemia is associated with pneumonia in 60–85%
of cases.2 Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and intensive
care treatment, there is a considerable case fatality in
pneumococcal bacteraemia—15–20% among adults overall,
with the highest rates among the elderly and in patients with
severe underlying medical conditions.3 Thus, pneumococcal
diseases are a major public health problem all over the world,
a problem underlined by the rapidly spreading antimicrobial
resistance to common and essential antibiotics.
Smoking is the most common cause of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and the rate of pneumococcal
disease is high among patients with this condition,4 5
probably due to defective clearance mechanisms. In these
patients, community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an
infectious illness that frequently leads to hospital admission
and increased morbidity and mortality. The main aetiology of
CAP in these patients is infection due to S pneumoniae in up to
43% of cases.6
The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) has been
found to be effective in the prevention of pneumococcal
pneumonia and bacteraemia in previously healthy young

people,7 and also in certain groups of patients at high risk of
developing pneumococcal infection.8 However, the degree of
protection afforded by PPV remains an issue of some debate,
despite the existence of a number of randomised (or quasirandomised) clinical trials, case-control, and indirect cohort
studies. The effectiveness of PPV has been questioned for
certain populations such as the elderly and some at-risk
groups including those with diabetes or chronic respiratory
illnesses. Part of the problem is the frequent disparity of
results between various clinical trials,9–13 including recent
meta-analyses that included the 23 serotype PPV.14–16
In Spain the 23 serotype PPV was not made commercially
available until 1999 and is currently subject to prescription
restrictions. It is still not included in general immunisation
programmes or recommendations and has been used only to
a very limited extent; in practice it is only given to
splenectomised patients.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of
23 serotype PPV in the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonias in immunocompetent patients with COPD.

METHODS
Patients were included in the study if they had not been
previously vaccinated and had a spirometric diagnosis of
COPD at the Pneumology Service of the University Hospital of
Valme (in the southern health area of Seville). Patients were

pneumonia and the isolation of S pneumoniae from the
sputum (for an adequate sample), bronchoaspirate, blood,
pleural fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid. Other aetiological
diagnoses were performed according to clinical guidelines.17
Patients admitted to hospital were given diagnostic tests as
considered necessary by their responsible doctor, according to
the seriousness of the case and in order to arrive at a
diagnosis (for example, blood culture, thoracocentesis). All
patients with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia were subject
to a new regime which included clinical revision and
radiography 2–4 weeks after the first visit. All the radiographs were examined by two doctors participating in the
study.
Analysis of data
Absolute numbers and percentages were computed to
describe the patient population. Medians and quartiles were
computed as appropriate. Categorical values were compared
using a x2 or Fisher’s test and crude odds ratios with 95%
confidence intervals were computed. Continuous variables
Cummulative proportion of patients without pneumonia

excluded from the study if they were pregnant, were
immunosuppressed, or had known neoplasia, renal insufficiency in dialysis, HIV infection, hypogammaglobulinaemia,
or anatomical or functional asplenia.
The study was approved by the ethics committee of the
hospital. A randomisation code was developed using a
computer random number generator in block lengths of 20
(10 in each group). Patients who agreed to be included in the
study and who fulfilled the selection criteria were informed
of the aims and characteristics of the study. They were then
randomly assigned to the intervention group and received 23valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine
(Pneumo 23; Aventis Pasteur MSD), together with a clinical
follow up examination. Subjects assigned to the nonintervention group had a clinical follow up examination but
no vaccine. The vaccine was given free of charge at the centre
where the patients were recruited. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients.
Demographic, clinical, and spirometric data were taken
from each patient at the start of the study. Following
inclusion, each patient had a clinical follow up examination
over 3 years. The physicians participating in this 3 year
follow up were unaware of the group to which individual
patients were assigned. The patients were instructed to
contact the doctor if they developed a fever of 38˚ for more
C
than 3 days or if they presented other symptoms that might
suggest pneumonia. All the participants were checked
routinely every 6 months or if they requested it.
The main outcome measured was time to the first episode
of CAP of pneumococcal or unknown aetiology. A diagnosis
of pneumonia was based on the finding of a new infiltrate
typical of pneumonia which diminished or disappeared
during follow up, and symptoms of lower respiratory tract
infection with fever. Pneumonia was considered as nosocomial if the onset of symptoms occurred more than 3 days
after admission to hospital or a chronic care unit and less
than 4 days after discharge. Other cases were considered to
have been acquired in the community. A diagnosis of
pneumococcal pneumonia was based on the presence of

were compared using the two tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test.
Unless otherwise stated, statistical significance is indicated
by p values of less than 5% (two sided). Crude event rates
were calculated by dividing the number of cases by the
person-time for each outcome. Multivariate Cox proportional
hazard models with covariates were used to evaluate the
association between the receipt of pneumococcal vaccine and
the time to a first outcome event during the study period and
excluding repeated episodes from analysis. To investigate the
possible effect of age and pulmonary function on the relative
risk of pneumonia over time, we included age (, or
>65 years) and the presence of severe airflow obstruction
(defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)
,40% of expected following SEPAR guidelines18) as covariates in a Cox regression model, and also an estimation of a
possible age6treatment interaction effect. The effects of the
vaccine were therefore investigated in the whole group of 596
patients as well in the subgroups of patients defined by the
previously mentioned variables (age and severity of obstruction). The subgroup analysis was performed because of
previously published data suggesting that younger patients
(,65 years) and those with more severe obstruction (FEV1
,40%) would benefit most from vaccine administration.7 12 16
Survival curves for patients younger than 65 years and with
severe COPD were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
The effectiveness of the anti-pneumococcal vaccine was
calculated by considering the first episode of pneumococcal
pneumonia as the first episode of CAP of unknown aetiology
or with isolation of pneumococcus (as 1 2 RR 6 100). The
number necessary to treat was calculated as the inverse of the
absolute reduction of risk.
The odds ratios and relative risk with 95% confidence
intervals were calculated using EPI-Info (CDC, USA). The
remaining tests were performed using SPSS Version 12.0 for
Windows.

RESULTS
Six hundred patients with a diagnosis of COPD were included
in the study using progressive intakes. Three hundred
received the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the other
300 were followed clinically during the same period. Four
patients (two from each arm of the study) were lost to follow
up and were excluded from the final analyses. The study
started in October 1999 and was completed in July 2004,
which allowed for a minimum follow up of 3 years for each
patient except 115 who died before the end of the follow up
period. No patient reported any local or systemic reaction to
the vaccine. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics
of the patients in the two groups are shown in table 1.
Although immunosuppressed patients were excluded, neoplasia was detected in 34 patients during follow up, but this
finding did not influence the effectiveness of PPV or the
incidence of pneumonia.

Table 2

Pneumonias
Seventy five patients had an episode of pneumonia during
the study, 38 (12.7%) in the intervention group and 37
(12.4%) in the non-intervention group. There were a total of
88 episodes of pneumonia, 43 in the intervention group and
45 in the non-intervention group. Sixty four patients had just
one episode of pneumonia (34 and 30 in the intervention and
non-intervention groups, respectively), nine had two episodes (three and six in the intervention and non-intervention
groups, respectively), and two had three episodes (one from
each group).
Of the 88 episodes of pneumonia, 73 (83%) were treated in
hospital and the other 15 were treated as outpatients. These
patients did not receive any special intervention and the
doctor responsible for their care decided on the studies to be
undertaken to determine the aetiology and treatment. An
aetiological diagnosis was obtained for 23 cases; 14 were
found to be due to Gram negative bacilli, two to fungi
(Aspergillus and Nocardia), two to Staphylococcus aureus, and five
to pneumococcus. The remaining 65 had unknown aetiologies. There were 12 nosocomial pneumonias, eight of known
aetiology that did not include pneumococcus and four of
unknown aetiology. There were 67 first episodes of CAP, 33 in
the intervention group and 34 in the non-intervention group.
Of these, 58 were either due to pneumococcus or of unknown
aetiology (25 in the intervention group, 33 in the nonintervention group). Most of these episodes required hospital
admission: 19/25 (76%) in the intervention group and 27/33
(81%) in the control group (p = 0.59). The median length of
stay was lower among vaccinated patients, although the
differences did not reach statistical significance (9.5 (6.5–
17) days v 12.0 (8.0–20.0) days, p = 0.16). The total number
of days in hospital due to CAP was 242 in the intervention
group and 412 in the control group.
Pneumococcal pneumonia
Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from five patients with
pneumonia in the non-intervention group and from none in
the intervention group (p = 0.03, single sided Fisher’s test).
In three cases it was the only isolated organism, in one
Haemophilus influenzae was also isolated, and the remaining
patient was also infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Pneumococcus was isolated from the sputum in two cases
and from the bronchial secretions obtained by bronchoscopy
in the other three. There were no cases of bacteraemic
pneumococcal infection.
Time to the first episode of CAP
Kaplan-Meier survival curves for CAP did not show a
significant difference between the intervention and nonintervention arms (log rank test = 1.15, p = 0.28, fig 1) in the
whole group of 596 patients, although there were significant
differences in predefined subgroups of patients (see below).

p = 0.0250). The Kaplan-Meier curve in fig 2 shows the
accumulated percentage of patients ,65 years without pneumonia (of unknown aetiology and pneumococcus) across time
for both the intervention and non-intervention groups (log
rank test = 6.68; p = 0.0097). Figure 3 shows a Kaplan-Meier
curve for patients with severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 ,40%
predicted), with the accumulated percentage of pneumonias
for both groups (log rank test = 3.85; p = 0.049). In the Cox
regression multivariate analyses (fig 4) the hazard ratio for
pneumonia was adjusted for the effects of age (,65 or
>65 years, table 4), the severity of obstruction (FEV1 ,40%
or >40%), and the interaction of age 6vaccine. This interaction
means that the efficacy of the vaccine depends on the age of the
patients. There was no sign of efficacy in older subjects
(>65 years) but younger patients (,65 years) in the intervention group were five times less likely to develop pneumonia
than a non-vaccinated person of the same age with COPD of
the same severity (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.68; p = 0.01).
Severity of airflow obstruction (FEV1 ,40%) was also a risk
factor for developing pneumonia (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.41;
p = 0.008). Similar results could be achieved if the model was
stratified by age. Instead of a global model with an interaction
term, we obtained two models for ages ,65 and >65 years
(table 4). For younger patients the model was very similar to
the previously described global model but, for older patients,
there was no indication of vaccine efficacy (RR 1.53, 95% CI
0.61 to 2.17; p = 0.66).

Incidence of pneumonia and efficacy of the vaccine
The incidence of global pneumonia (CAP and nosocomial) in
patients with COPD was 55.1 per 1000 patients with COPD
per year. In those with CAP, it was 47.6 per 1000 patients
with COPD per year (46.3 in the intervention group, 49.0 in
the non-intervention group). Table 2 shows the incidence of
pneumonia by age and severity of airflow obstruction. The
incidence of non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia was
313 per 100 000 patients with COPD per year.
Table 3 shows the results of univariate analysis and the
efficacy of the anti-pneumococcal vaccine in preventing
pneumonia which, in the whole group of patients with
COPD, was 24% (95% CI 224 to 54; p = 0.333). The efficacy
increased in the subgroup of younger patients of ,65 years
up to 76% (95% CI 20 to 93; p = 0.013) and in those with
severe functional obstruction to 48% (95% CI 27 to 80;
p = 0.076). In the subgroup of younger patients with severe
airflow obstruction the efficacy increased up to 91% (95% CI
35 to 99; p = 0.002) with a number needed to treat of three
COPD patients (95% CI 2 to 4).
The risk ratio (RR) and vaccine efficacy could not be
calculated when there was no case of pneumonia with isolated
pneumococcus in the intervention group, which is why both
groups could only be compared by survival analysis.
Accordingly, the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for pneumococcal pneumonia show a significant difference between the
intervention and non-intervention groups (log rank test = 5.03;

Mortality
There was no difference in the mortality rates between the
two groups which was around 19%. The major cause of death
was respiratory failure in 34 patients, followed by cardiovascular diseases in 29 cases, cancer detected during follow up in
21 subjects (11 of these were pulmonary carcinomas), 13
deaths due to infections (12 for pneumonia, one being
pneumococcus), 11 to gastrointestinal causes, five to other
causes, and two due to unknown causes. Factors influencing
the mortality rate among the patients were age (RR 1.05, 95%
CI 1.03 to 1.08; p,0.001), FEV1 % predicted (RR 0.97, 95% CI
0.95 to 0.98; p,0.001), current smokers (RR 1.67, 95% CI
1.08 to 2.60; p = 0.022), and the presence of neoplasia (RR
6.54, 95% CI 4.15 to 10.23; p,0.001). The mortality rate for
nosocomial pneumonia and CAP in those with COPD was
50.8 per 1000 per year (and 34.4 in those with CAP only).

DISCUSSION
This study shows that the protective efficacy of 23 serotype
PPV in immunocompetent COPD patients for the prevention
of radiologically proven pneumonia of pneumococcal and
unknown aetiology is linked to two factors—the age of the
patient and the severity of the airflow obstruction—as can be
seen from the survival analysis. The vaccine had an efficacy
of 76% (95% CI 20 to 93) in patients of ,65 years of age and
91% (95% CI 35 to 99) in those who also had severe airflow
obstruction. Pneumonia cases from whom pneumococcus
was isolated were not found in the intervention group. As
expected, cases of pneumococcal bacteraemia were not found
in the non-intervention group since bacteraemia occurs in
only 10–20% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia.2 7

Table 4

Nevertheless, within this group, the vaccine had no effect in
the subgroup of patients over the age of 65 years.
Practically all clinical studies10–12 19 and meta-analyses7 15 16
agree as to the efficacy of the vaccine in the prevention of
invasive pneumococcal disease; however, data regarding the
effectiveness of this vaccine in reducing other more common
manifestations of pneumococcal disease such as pneumonia
have been inconclusive for elderly and high risk groups.
Nichol et al,20 in a retrospective cohort study, showed that
pneumococcal vaccination of elderly people with chronic lung
disease was associated with fewer hospital admissions for
pneumonia (defined by ICD-9CM codes) and fewer deaths,
with the additional effect of influenza vaccination. Hedlund
et al,21 in a recently published prospective cohort study,
showed a reduction in the incidence of hospital admissions
for pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease in the year
following vaccination, adjusted for sex and age. The reasons
for these disparate findings include differences in the study
population, the prevalence and diagnosis of non-bacteraemic
pneumococcal pneumonia, and in the methods used for
ascertaining vaccination status.12
The incidence of CAP requiring admission to hospital is 2.7
per 1000 of the population, which increases with age to 10.1
per 1000 for those aged over 65 years.22 A recent Spanish
report established the relative risk of developing pneumonia
in patients with COPD as 4.7 times that of the general
population over 65 years.23 The overall incidence rate of CAP
in our COPD patients was 47.6 episodes per 1000 COPD years,
which corresponds to that expected. The incidence increased
significantly in subjects over the age of 65 years with COPD
to 51.6 per 1000 COPD years, and in those with severe airflow
obstruction to 63.6 per 1000 COPD years. In this last group
the efficacy of the vaccine was shown in the prevention of
pneumonias of both pneumococcal and unknown aetiology.
It is highly unlikely that there was any bias towards
omitting nosocomial pneumonias of pneumococcal aetiology,
since pneumococcus was isolated in 5% of nosocomial
infections from any origin.24 Also, we excluded non-pneumococcal cases of known aetiology because mixed infections
are produced in about 2% of cases.22 This reduced the number
of cases for analysis, but we believe it reflected more closely
the true number of non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonias; by contrast, all of the pneumonias were radiologically
proven, including those of outpatients. The reduction in
pneumonias of unknown aetiology after vaccination supports
the suspicion that some of these pneumonias may be due to
pneumococcus. Perhaps all of these discrepancies could be
clarified with a more widespread use of the antigenuria test
to detect pneumococcus. This might identify, in a more
precise way, the non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonias. Although the aetiology in our patients was frequently
unknown, there were an appreciable number of Gram
negative bacterial pneumonias. This aetiology is justified

because many of them were hospital acquired and these
patients—because of their more serious condition—have
more diagnostic tests performed in the aetiological diagnosis.
Despite many studies of the effectiveness of anti-pneumococcal vaccine for different populations, few have been
performed on patients with COPD. Leech et al9 administered
a 14-serotype anti-pneumococcal vaccine to patients with an
FEV1 of less than 1.5 litres. No differences were found
between the groups in the 2 year follow up period in terms of
death or deteriorating conditions, which is attributed to the
small number of patients included in the series and the low
rate of pneumococcal bacteraemia. Franzen et al25 in another
short series study of 65 patients with longstanding emphysema and/or bronchitis found a reduction in the number of
pneumonias at 1 year follow up compared with the year
before vaccination. The most representative study is the
retrospective study of Nichol et al20 involving 1898 patients
with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis of chronic lung disease
including illnesses other than COPD such as bronchial
asthma, bronchiectasis and fibrosis, giving a population less
homogeneous than ours.
Our study analysed the efficacy of the anti-pneumococcal
vaccine in a homogeneous cohort of patients with a clinical
and spirometric diagnosis of COPD. We established the
differences in the incidence of pneumonia according to the
degree of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. The
incidence of pneumonia was 1.7 times greater in patients
with a severe degree of airflow obstruction than in those with
light to moderate disease. Analysis of the efficacy of the
vaccine according to the degree of airflow obstruction showed
that the vaccine tended to be more beneficial in patients with
the most severe obstruction. We therefore support the
recommendation that anti-pneumococcal vaccine should be
administered to these patients, independent of the cost
effectiveness analysis already cited.20
Most COPD patients with CAP (76% and 81% in the
intervention and control groups, respectively) need hospital
admission, with prolonged lengths of inpatient stay and
increased medical costs. A low cost intervention such as PPV
that tends to reduce the incidence of pneumonia should
therefore be cost effective.
Nichol et al20 and Hedlund et al21 found a reduction in the
mortality rate of patients who received PPV which can only
be explained by a reduction in the specific mortality due to
pneumonia of pneumococcal aetiology. However, these
studies did not state this categorically, so other uncontrolled
factors may have influenced the mortality rate in these
patients. In our study the 23 serotype PPV had no effect on
the mortality rate. Although it is certain there was a death
due to pneumococcal pneumonia in the non-intervention
group, this was not sufficient to generate a difference
between the groups. The factors that influenced mortality
in our patients, in addition to the presence of neoplasia, were
those classically described in patients with COPD (age,
severity of airflow obstruction, and current smoking).
A considerable limitation of this study is the lack of a blind
placebo comparison group. Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely
that this limitation significantly influenced the results
because the vaccination status of the patient was kept in a
specific encrypted database and was not stated in the
patients’ clinical records. The main investigator of this study
(IA) was the only person with access to this database, but
this investigator did not participate in the follow up or in
adjudicating the outcome events. This task was performed by
the physicians conducting the follow up who were unaware
of the treatment group allocation of their patients. These
investigators were committed not to ask patients about their
vaccination status. Furthermore, during the follow up period
most patients from both groups also received vaccination

against influenza for several years; this could be confusing,
especially for old patients from rural areas (the majority in
the present study) and probably many of them did not have a
clear idea of their anti-pneumococcal vaccination status after
3 years of follow up.
In summary, PPV should be given to patients with COPD
aged ,65 years, especially if they have severe airflow
obstruction. This vaccination could prevent episodes of
pneumococcal pneumonia frequently labelled as ‘‘pneumonia
of unknown aetiology’’. Further studies are needed with a
larger sample to examine a possible protective effect in the
elderly population and in COPD patients with less severe
obstruction. In addition, studies should be undertaken to
determine the real incidence of non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, as well as perfecting the diagnostic
methods used in its detection. This would permit the
effectiveness of PPV to be determined with greater precision,
and its possible substitution by other types of anti-pneumococcal vaccines, such as pneumococcal protein conjugate
vaccine26 or by other protein vaccines, to be assessed.27

ll deaths under the age of 65 with asthma recorded in the first part of the death
certificate were examined from a population of approximately 5.25 million people.
Hospital and GP records were scrutinised and GPs were interviewed to ensure that
asthma was the cause of death. Fifty seven of the original 95 reported deaths were due to
asthma; the other 38 deaths were due to COPD (n = 13), cardiac disease (n = 11),
pneumonia (n = 9), and other conditions.
Of the 57 confirmed asthma deaths, 19 patients had significant co-morbid diseases. 60%
of the asthma fatalities were male, a reverse of the male/female ratio observed in severe
asthma. 53% of patients were felt to have severe asthma according to BTS guidelines, 21%
had moderately severe asthma, 16% mild asthma, and 11% not known. Eleven patients
(19%, eight male, eight aged 20 years or less) suffered sudden death from acute severe
asthma; 10 of these occurred between April and August suggesting that atopy may have had
a role. The other 81% had more protracted courses of their final illness with potential
opportunity for earlier intervention. The authors point out that the data were, by their
nature, retrospective and occasionally incomplete.
Patient care was considered appropriate in only 33% of cases. Failings were present across
primary and secondary care and included inadequate follow up (failures to refer to hospital
at an appropriate time or to a respiratory specialist once in hospital) and inadequate
prescription of inhaled or oral corticosteroids. 81% of patients had psychosocial or
behavioural factors that were considered to be contributory to death. These included poor
compliance/failure to attend (61%), but also significant smoking (46%), denial (37%),
depression (20%), alcohol abuse (20%), and family disharmony (15%).
The authors endorse the production of an ‘‘at risk’’ register in primary care as advocated
by the 2003 BTS/SIGN asthma guidelines and suggest criteria to guide the construction of
such a register.
