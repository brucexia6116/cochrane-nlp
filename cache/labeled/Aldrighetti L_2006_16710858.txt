Hepatic injury secondary to warm ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and alterations in haemostatic parameters are often
unavoidable events after major hepatic resection. The release of inﬂammatory mediator is believed to play a signiﬁcant role in
the genesis of these events. It has been suggested that preoperative steroid administration may reduce I/R injury and improve
several aspects of the surgical stress response. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to investigate the clinical
beneﬁts on I/R injury and systemic responses of preoperatively administered corticosteroids. <n>Seventy-six</n> patients undergoing
liver resection were randomized either to a steroid group or to a control group. Patients in the steroid group received
preoperatively 500 mg of methylprednisolone. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), total bilirubin, coagulation parameters, and inﬂammatory mediators, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were
compared between the 2 groups. Length of stay, and type and number of complications were recorded as well. Postoperative
serum levels of ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and inﬂammatory cytokines were signiﬁcantly lower in the steroid than in the control
group at postoperative days 1 and 2. Changes in hemostatic parameters were also signiﬁcantly attenuated in the steroid group.
In conclusion, the incidence of postoperative complications in the steroid group tended to be signiﬁcantly lower than the control
group. It is of clinical interest that preoperative steroids administration before major surgery may reduce I/R injury, maintain
coagulant/anticoagulant homeostasis, and reduce postoperative complications by modulating the inﬂammatory response.

The human body reacts to surgical stimuli through
various systemic responses including the endocrine,
metabolic, coagulation, and immune systems. However, extended damage may result in an exaggerated
systemic response with an overwhelming activation of
immune cells and the release of various mediators of
stress.1-3 The systemic reaction to the operation is considered to be equivalent to the systemic inﬂammation
response syndrome, mainly caused by cytokine networks.4,5 Raised levels of inﬂammatory cytokines have
been related to higher postoperative mortality and morbidity rates.2,3,6 Therefore, increased attention has

evolved toward modulating potentially deleterious inﬂammatory response to the operation.
The anti-inﬂammatory and immune modulating effects of steroids have been known for decades and have
found extensive therapeutic use in a wide range of diseases in which inﬂammatory responses play major
role.7,8 Several trials have investigated the beneﬁts of
administering corticosteroids as a modulator of cytokine response in patients undergoing elective cardiothoracic or gastrointestinal surgery, as well as in cases
of septic shock, suggesting that several aspects of the
surgical stress responses, organ dysfunction, and post-

resection. In cases of major resection, control of vascular inﬂow and outﬂow was obtained extraparenchymally. Transection of the hepatic parenchyma was carried out by a combination of the ultrasonic dissector
(Soring, Sonoca, Quickborn, Germany) and ultrasonic
scalpel (Ultracision, Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH) along
with hemostasis of the vessels by clips or ligations.
The intermittent Pringle maneuver was applied at the
time of liver transection and consisted of cross-clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament for 20 minutes and
releasing the clamp for 10 minutes until the transection
was completed. The procedure was repeated as necessary. In all patients, central venous pressure was monitored by a central venous catheter and arterial pressure by a radial catheter. During parenchymal
transection, central venous pressure was maintained
below 5 cm H2O. A closed suction drain was placed
along the transection surface in all patients. All patients were operated on by the same hepatobiliary surgical team (L.A., M.C., M.A.), who were unaware of each
patient’s group allocation. Unless clinically contraindicated, a systemic antibiotic, ﬁrst-generation cephalosporin (Cefazolin, Mead Johnson, Princeton, NJ), was
routinely applied just before the surgery.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients

Postoperative Management

From April 2004 to February 2005, 76 consecutive patients undergoing elective hepatic resection under
warm intermittent ischemia at the Department of Surgery–Liver Unit at Scientiﬁc Institute H San Raffaele in
Milan, Italy, were enrolled into the trial. Patients were
assigned randomly by sealed envelope to a steroid
group (n ϭ 38) or a control group (n ϭ 38) by a single
investigator (R.F.) not involved in the subsequent surgical procedures as well as postoperative treatments
and data collection (Fig. 1). Patients in the steroid group
received 500 mg of methylprednisolone (Pharmacia
Corp., Peapack, NJ) diluted in 100 mL physiologic saline, before the induction of anesthesia.
Patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B or C and
patients requiring concomitant thoracic or colorectal
surgery as well as additional ablation therapies were
excluded from the study. Patients receiving a total ischemia time of less than 20 minutes were also excluded.
Patients requiring total vascular exclusion or a Rouxen-Y hepaticojejunostomy were included. Two patients
were excluded from this trial because the portal clamping was not applied, and 1 patient was excluded because of unexpected additional radiofrequency. The ﬁnal cohort included 73 patients, 37 in the control group
and 36 in the steroid group (Fig. 1). The study protocol
was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained before enrollment in the
trial.

Clear liquids with a rapid advancement of diet were
begun on or around postoperative day (POD) 2 unless a
biliary-enteric anastomosis had been performed.
Packed red blood cells were administered if the hemoglobin fell below 8 g/dL or with hemoglobin levels below
9 g/dL in patients with altered cardiopulmonary function. Fresh frozen plasma was given if the prothrombin
time-international normalized ratio was higher than
1.5 . Prophylaxis of thromboembolic events was made
by administrating daily subcutaneous 3,800 IU of lowmolecular-weight heparin (Seleparina, Italfarmaco, Milan, Italy) after POD 1, unless clinically contraindicated.
No nutritional support was provided, and the central
venous catheter was removed on POD 3. Postoperative
pain control was achieved with epidural analgesia. No
patient affected by chronic hepatitis B received concomitant nucleoside analogs therapy.

Surgical Procedure
Laparotomy was performed through a right subcostal
incision and a midline incision. Intraoperative ultrasound was performed before deciding on the type of

Clinical and Laboratory Variables
Postoperative markers of hepatocyte damage and recovery, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total
bilirubin, were measured using a serum multiple biochemical analyzer, preoperatively and on POD 1, 2, and
5. antithrombin III (AT-III), prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, ﬁbrinogen, D dimer, and platelets were also measured the day before operation and
on POD 1, 2, and 5. AT-III was measured with chromogenic substrates, and the results are expressed as percentages (normal range, 70 to 130%).
Data regarding preoperative variables, duration of
surgery, intraoperative blood loss and transfusion, intraoperative and postoperative complication, and hos-

pital stay were prospectively collected by a single investigator unaware of each patient’s group allocation
(C.P.). Underlying liver disorders such as steatosis, ﬁbrosis, and other types of injury were also evaluated.
Postoperative transfusions, clinical and biologic signs
of hepatic dysfunction, and all types of surgical or medical complications were taken into account. Liver function was assessed by clinical and biological data. Hepatic dysfunction was considered in cases of
encephalopathy, ascites (volume Ͼ500 mL per day),
prothrombin time-international normalized ratio Ͼ1.5
on day 5 or Ͼ2 at any moment;, or bilirubin level Ͼ3
mg/dL on day 5. Infections were deﬁned as positive
culture of blood, sputum, or other ﬂuids in the presence
of clinical evidence of infection.14 Adverse effects of
chronic steroid use, such as abnormality in glucose
tolerance and delay in wound healing, were evaluated.

Serum levels of TNF-␣ and IL-6
Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣) and
interleukin 6 (IL-6), as indicators of the surgical stress
response, were measured at the induction of anesthesia
and on POD 1, 2 and 5. Serum levels were quantiﬁed by
using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer’s speciﬁcations (Bouty,
Milan, Italy). Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for
10 minutes and stored at Ϫ80°C until analysis. Data
were then presented as picograms per milliliter. The
detection limit of the assay was 1 pg/mL for TNF-␣ and
0.1 pg/mL for IL-6.

Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were compared using the MannWhitney test and categorical variables were compared
using chi-square test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Multiple comparisons were made using repeatedmeasure ANOVA as needed. To assess for the inﬂuence
of age, gender, resected liver volume, ischemia time,
and chronic liver disease on the difference of the ALT
and total bilirubin peak between the 2 groups, a multiple regression model was performed. Signiﬁcance was
deﬁned as P Ͻ 0.05. All analyses were performed using
the statistical package SPSS 12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

RESULTS
Clinical Variables of Patients
Included in the study were 45 males and 28 females with
a median age of 65 years (range, 31-85 years). Twentyfour patients were operated on for liver metastases from
colorectal cancer, 26 for hepatocellular carcinoma, 6 for
various kinds of metastatic diseases, 8 for cholangiocellular carcinoma, 2 for hemangioendothelioma, and 1 for
gallbladder cancer. In 6 patients liver resection was performed for benign diseases, such as focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, or hepatolithiasis. Cirrhosis was
present in 26 patients, 4 patients had hepatitis B virus,
18 patients had hepatitis C virus, and 4 patients had
alcoholic hepatitis. There was no signiﬁcant difference

regarding patient age, gender, underlying liver disease, or
different diagnosis between patients randomized in the
steroid vs. control group (Table 1).
An extended right hepatectomy was performed in 9
patients, while 4 patients underwent an extended left
hepatectomy. A formal left or right hepatectomy was
performed in 14 and 21 patients, respectively. Ten patients received a segmental resection involving at least
2 segments, a segmentectomy was performed in 9 patients and a wedge resection in 6 patients. A Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy was performed in 4 patients. The
type and number of procedures were comparable (P ϭ
not signiﬁcant) between both groups. The overall median operation time was 420 minutes (range, 240-730
minutes) with a median blood loss of 500 (range, 1502,000 mL). The median clamping time was 44 minutes
(range, 20-94 minutes).
There was no signiﬁcant difference regarding perioperative variables between patients randomized in the
steroid group vs. the control group (Table 2).

Postoperative Blood Chemistry
The degree of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury of the
liver was assessed by postoperative peak serum ALT
and AST levels. The transaminase peak occurred within
the ﬁrst postoperative day in all patients. Patients
treated with preoperative steroid pulse had signiﬁcantly
lower mean (SD) peak ALT values when compared with
the control group on POD 1 (409 Ϯ 361 vs. 651 Ϯ 393
U/L, P ϭ 0.002) and POD 2 (277 Ϯ 183 vs. 402 Ϯ 303
U/L, P ϭ 0.045). Similarly, mean (SD) peak AST values
were signiﬁcantly reduced in the steroid group when
compared with the control group on POD 1 (428 Ϯ 312
vs. 700 Ϯ 388 U/L, P ϭ 0.002) and POD 2 (242 Ϯ 170
vs. 359 Ϯ 273 U/L, P ϭ 0.027) (Fig. 2).
The mean (SD) postoperative bilirubin values were
also signiﬁcantly lower in the steroid group than in the
control group on POD 1 (1.39 Ϯ 0.6 vs. 2.80 Ϯ 1.2
mg/dL, P ϭ 0.0001 ), POD 2 (1.31 Ϯ 0.7 vs. 2.41 Ϯ 1.5
mg/dL, P ϭ 0.004), and POD 5 (1.10 Ϯ 0.6 vs. 1.61 Ϯ
1.1 mg/dL, P ϭ 0.0136) (Fig. 2).
Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the
impact of age, gender, resected liver volume, ischemia
time, and chronic liver disease on the protective effects
of preoperative methylprednisolone administration.
Two factors were found to be statistically signiﬁcant in
the multivariate analysis: the amount of the resected
liver parenchyma and the length of ischemic time. The
protective effects of methylprednisolone administration
were directly correlated with the percentage of resected
tissue. Steroid administration was associated with
more than half a reduction of peak bilirubin levels in
patients undergoing resections involving Ͼ60% of the
total liver volume (Fig. 3).
The protective effects of methylprednisolone administration were also more evident in patients with increasing
ischemic times. While only moderate protection of methylprednisolone was observed in patients with ischemia
times Ͻ30 minutes, patients with longer ischemic times

There were no postoperative deaths. Fourteen patients (37.8%) in the control group, and 5 patients
(13.9%) in the steroid group had one or more complications within 7 days after surgery. The steroid group
had a signiﬁcantly lower overall morbidity rate than
the control group (P ϭ 0.019). Postoperative complications included 2 bile leaks, 1 heart failure, 2 acute
cardiac ischemias, 2 pleural effusions, 2 wound infections, 6 liver decompensations, and 1 postoperative intra-abdominal bleeding that required relaparotomy. Infections occurred in 10 patients. The
distribution of complications between the 2 groups is
listed in Table 3. Infective complications were significantly lower in the steroid group than in the control
group (5.5% vs. 21.6%, P ϭ 0.047). Gram-positive and

The liver appears to be a key organ in the response
against surgical stress, since it produces inﬂammatory
proteins, modiﬁes the hemostatic balance, and alters
protein metabolism under surgical stress. This reaction
of the liver is called the hepatic acute-phase response.15 The goal of the hepatic acute-phase response
is to restore homeostasis; however, a prolonged and
exaggerated response leads to increased morbidity and
mortality rate.16-18 Current evidence suggests that the
hepatic acute-phase response is mainly mediated by
inﬂammatory cytokines; among these, IL-6 and TNF-␣
have been known to play a prominent role.3,19
Inﬂammatory cytokines are thought to play a significant role in many adverse immune-mediated events
following liver surgery, including hepatic I/R injury,20
coagulation activation,21 postoperative organ dysfunction, and immune suppression by surgical stress itself.3,22,23 Therefore, treatments to minimize the cytokine response may play a potentially relevant role in
reducing perioperative morbidity.12,13,24,25 The aim of
the present study was to investigate the effects of preoperative steroids administration in patients undergoing hepatic resection.
The ﬁrst reports on the protective effects of steroids
on liver ischemia were published in 1975.26 SantiagoDelpin and Figueroa found that methylprednisolone
treatment before hepatic occlusion results in increased
animal survival and reduced liver damage, as demonstrated by histology, when compared with ischemic
controls. Even though the exact molecular-biologic
mechanisms of steroids action on hepatic I/R injury
remain partially unknown, it is thought that steroid
therapy suppresses liver injury by a variety of mechanisms, including increased tissue blood ﬂow and suppression of oxygen free radicals, inhibition of lysosomal
proteases, suppression of calpain ␮ activation, inhibition of apoptotic activity and reduced cytokine production.26-30
In this study, preoperative methylprednisolone administration attenuated signiﬁcantly I/R associated

tissue injury and lowered postoperative indicators of
hepatocyte damage and recovery.
Although some series recommended preoperative steroids administration,31,32 concerns exist on the clinical
use of steroids in liver surgery, because of the possible
negative effects on liver regeneration after resection.
However, while evaluating several indexes of hepatocyte
proliferation, Glanemann et al. have demonstrated that
preoperative steroids administration has no apparent
effects on hepatic regeneration.30 Furthermore, liver
regeneration is strictly dependent on cytokine IL-633,34;
it has been suggested that the overproduction of IL-6
inhibits liver regeneration.35 In the present study, cytokinemia after hepatectomy was clearly attenuated
but not completely suppressed by the preoperative administration of methylprednisolone.
The protective effects of preoperative methylprednisolone administration were more pronounced in patients with larger resection volume and with increased
ischemic time. In addition to the mechanical injury to
hepatic microvascular bed by hemodynamic force induced by excessive portal perfusion,36 the I/R injury
induced by subsequent upregulation of inﬂammatory
cytokine is also known to play a contributing role in the
pathogenesis of small-for-size injury that follow extended liver resection.37 Studies in patients with major
liver resection are further warranted, as preoperative
steroid administration might be important to avoid
postoperative liver failure and death. Another ﬁnding
was the increased protective effects in patients with
more than 30 minutes of ischemia. As 30 minutes is the
minimal ischemia time associated with detectable injury after reperfusion,38 it can be expected that the
protective effect is more marked when the ischemic
injury is long enough to induce permanent injury.
Thus, preoperative steroid administration seems to
represent a valid strategy if a temporary liver ischemia
is required during surgery, in order to reduce complications caused by ischemia-related organ dysfunction
without detrimental effects on liver regeneration.
Alterations in hemostatic parameters is a common
ﬁnding after major hepatic resection. Hepatic dysfunction following ischemia reperfusion, removal of signiﬁcant hepatic volume, and heavy hemorrhage upset the
coagulation balance because of impaired synthesis of
clotting factors, regulatory proteins, and production of
inﬂammatory mediators.39-41
There is growing evidence that inﬂammation has a
signiﬁcant role in increasing the activation of coagulation cascade.21,42 High concentrations of inﬂammatory
cytokines are related to an increased risk of thromboembolic complications.43,44 Actually, it is becoming increasingly evident that anticoagulants, particularly
natural anticoagulants, can limit the inﬂammatory-induced derangement in the coagulation.45 AT-III, which
is synthesized in the liver, is known to play an important role in the anticoagulant system by preventing
intravascular thrombin formation and inhibiting coagulation by downregulating procoagulant activities. In
addition to the anticoagulant effects, AT-III exerts antiinﬂammatory effects by limiting the expression of ad-

hesion molecules, cytokines and other mediators such
as platelet activating factor.46 Harada et al. have recently demonstrated that AT-III reduces I/R induced
liver injury in rats by increasing the cyclo-oxygenase 1
mediated production of prostaglandines.47
As we have previously reported,48 preoperative administration of methylprednisolone effectively attenuated the decrease of AT-III following hepatic resection.
Interestingly, the decrease in AT-III resulted to have a
strong correlation with serum level of IL-6.
A prolonged prothrombin time and reduced platelet
count, as well as an increase in ﬁbrinolysis are common
alterations after major hepatic resection.49-51 These hemostatic ﬁndings resemble those seen in disseminated
intravascular coagulation, and their severity is proportional to the extent of liver resection and to severity of
the combined liver disease.50,51 The production and the
release of inﬂammatory cytokines are known to play a
fundamental role in the pathogenesis of disseminated
intravascular coagulation.43,52 Moreover, previous studies in animal models have suggested a protective role of
corticosteroids against the development of disseminated
intravascular coagulation.52,53
It is of clinical interest that in the present study prothrombin time, platelet count, and ﬁbrinogen were signiﬁcantly preserved in the steroid group. Likewise Ddimer levels, a marker of ﬁbrinolysis that leads to
oozing blood loss during hepatectomy, was signiﬁcantly
reduced in the steroid group. These data suggest that
the hypercoagulable and hyperﬁbrinolytic statuses induced by hepatic resection may be attenuated by the
preoperative administration of steroids.
While previous studies in smaller cohorts of patients
undergoing liver surgery with preoperative steroid
pulse have not demonstrated any evident improvement
in the postoperative clinical course,11,12 in the present
study a signiﬁcant improvement in postoperative complications and length of stay was recorded in the steroid
group. This disagreement probably stems from the limited number of patients enrolled and end points of clinical outcome in different studies.
While the overall morbidity rate of 54% in the control
group in our study was similar to that reported in other
series of patients undergoing liver surgery,54,55 the rate
was as low as 13.8% in the steroid group. Several authors have reported a correlation between raised levels
of IL-6 and postoperative complications.2,3 This study
conﬁrms an increased number of complications in patients with higher postoperative IL-6 levels. In particular, infective complications were more frequent in the
control group than in the steroid group. It is of great
interest that the possible clinical effects of preoperative
steroid administration include the prevention of bacterial translocation and immunosuppression induced by
hepatic resection itself. Yamashita et al.12 have previously reported that the administration of steroids in
liver surgery results in decreased values of immunosuppressive acid protein and postoperative positive rate
of serum Candida antigen, which is a marker of bacterial traslocation.56 Similar ﬁndings were reported in
other operations, including esophagectomy.57 In addi-

tion the median hospital stay was shorter in the steroid
group, and adverse effects of steroid use, such as abnormality in glucose tolerance and delay in wound
healing, did not occur in any of our patients.
The steroids administration regimen used in this
study was based on the following considerations. The
anti-inﬂammatory actions of methylprednisolone are 5
times as strong as those of cortisol, but it has a reduced
activity on electrolytes. The duration of methylprednisolone’s biologic action is 36 hours, and the half-life
in the blood is 2.8 hours.58 As a result, both early and
late phase of hepatic I/R injury should be covered by a
single administration.59 Intravenous administration of
500 mg of methylprednisolone has been conﬁrmed to
result in a methylprednisolone level of more than 1
␮g/mL in blood or more than 10 ␮g/mL in liver tissue,12 and more than 10 ␮g/mL of methylprednisolone
can signiﬁcantly suppress lymphocyte blastoid transformation, immunoglobulin production, and natural
killer cell activity.60
In conclusion, this prospective randomized study has
established preoperative steroid administration as a
safe and effective modulator of surgical stress. It is of
clinical interest that preoperative steroids administration before major surgery may reduce I/R injury, maintain coagulant/anticoagulant homeostasis, and reduce
postoperative complication by modulating the inﬂammatory response.
