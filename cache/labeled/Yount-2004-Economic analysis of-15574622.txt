Economic Analysis of Palivizumab in Infants With Congenital
Heart Disease
Laura E. Yount, MD, and William T. Mahle, MD
ABSTRACT. Objective. Palivizumab has been shown
to reduce the number of respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV)-related hospitalizations by 45% in children with
congenital heart disease (CHD). The American Academy
of Pediatrics has recommended that infants with hemodynamically significant CHD be considered for palivizumab. However, the economic implications of palivizumab prophylaxis in the CHD population have not
been evaluated. In the present study, we sought to examine the cost savings and cost utility of RSV prophylaxis
with palivizumab in children with CHD.
Methods. Probabilities of hospitalization and efficacy of prophylaxis were based on published results.
Costs of hospitalization were derived from a published
analysis of bronchiolitis hospitalization costs from a consortium of children’s hospitals. A hypothetical cohort of
<n>10 000</n> CHD patients (half of whom would receive palivizumab) was created to calculate cost-savings and costutility. To assess cost utility, we assumed that by reducing hospitalization, palivizumab would reduce RSVrelated hospital mortality, generally reported to be 3% in
CHD patients. Sensitivity analysis was performed.
Results. On the basis of a protocol of 5 monthly doses
of palivizumab, the cost of prophylaxis for 1 RSV season
was calculated as $6160 per patient. After accounting for
impact on direct and indirect costs of hospitalization,
administration of palivizumab to 5000 CHD patients
would result in a net loss of $20 415 753. If one assumes
that palivizumab confers a survival benefit, then the cost
of life-year saved is $100 338 and cost of quality-adjusted
life-year saved is $114 337.
Conclusions. The cost of palivizumab prophylaxis
was high relative to benefits realized. Given the large
number of CHD patients who might be considered candidates for RSV prophylaxis (>6000 patients per year in
United States) routine use of palivizumab in young children with hemodynamically significant CHD needs to be
evaluated further. Pediatrics 2004;114:1606–1611; bronchiolitis, congenital heart disease/defects, cost analysis.

ronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of morbidity
and mortality in the pediatric population, accounting for ϳ100 000 hospitalizations per year in
the United States.1 Children who are hospitalized for
RSV without other risk factors experience an ϳ1%
mortality.1 Children with congenital heart disease
(CHD) are more vulnerable, having a mortality of 2%
to 3% for RSV-related hospitalizations in some studies.1,2
Palivizumab (Synagis; MedImmune Inc, Gaithersburg, MD) is a monoclonal antibody that has been
shown to lessen the severity of RSV bronchiolitis.3 In
a recent multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, palivizumab significantly reduced the number of RSVrelated hospitalizations in children with CHD.4 This
study demonstrated that the risk for hospital admission for RSV bronchiolitis was lower and the total
number of hospital days was less in patients who
received palivizumab. No survival benefit was demonstrated. On the basis in part of the results of this
study, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
recommended that “palivizumab is appropriate for
infants and young children with hemodynamically
significant CHD.”5
The high cost of palivizumab remains a concern,
however, and several studies have questioned the
cost-effectiveness in preterm infants.6–8 The economic implications of palivizumab prophylaxis in
the CHD population have not been evaluated. Given
the high cost of RSV prophylaxis and large number
of children who might be eligible on the basis of AAP
recommendations (Ͼ6000 children in the United
States) a critical examination of the costs of palivizumab in the CHD population is warranted.

Decision Analysis
A decision-analytic model comparing palivizumab with no
prophylaxis for a hypothetical cohort of 10 000 pediatric CHD
patients was constructed. We adopted the perspective of a clinician who must decide whether to administer prophylaxis to a
CHD patient at the beginning of the RSV season. Half of the cohort
was assigned to receive palivizumab, and half was assigned to the
no-prophylaxis group. Although the number of doses required for
adequate prophylaxis during a given RSV season has been debated, for the present study, we used a 5-dose regimen as has been
used in the majority of studies.9 The distribution of various heart
lesions in this hypothetical cohort was based on previous reports
from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, which
is a population-based study that has been collecting, analyzing,
and interpreting birth defects data for Ͼ30 years.10 As palivizumab is recommended only for children with hemodynamically
significant CHD such as cyanosis, congestive heart failure, and

pulmonary hypertension, we included diagnoses that were likely
to meet these criteria. Diagnoses such as transposition of the great
arteries, for example, were not included because these patients
routinely undergo complete repair in the first weeks of life and
generally have normal postoperative hemodynamics. For patients
with ventricular septal defect, we assumed that only 25% would
have a hemodynamically significant lesion on the basis of published data.11 Because cardiomyopathy is not included in the
Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, we estimated
the prevalence of infant dilated cardiomyopathy from a recently
published multi-institutional study and 2000 US Census data.12,13
Probability of hospitalization, need for intensive care unit (ICU)
admission, and length of hospital stay were derived from the
multicenter, placebo-controlled trial of palivizumab in patients
with hemodynamically significant CHD.4
Using the societal perspective, we considered medical costs and
work-loss costs. The primary outcome was hospital savings. This
represents the reduction in hospitalization cost minus the cost of
palivizumab prophylaxis. Costs are reported in 2002 US dollars.

Data and Assumptions
The probability of hospitalization for patients who received
palivizumab was 5.3% and for patients who did not receive prophylaxis was 9.7%.4 The number of days in intensive care was also
higher for the placebo group: 71.2 versus 15.9/100 children.

Direct Costs
Medical Costs
The average wholesale acquisition cost of on a 100-mg vile of
palivizumab was $1369.14 The recommended dose of palivizumab
is 15 mg/kg administered once monthly throughout the RSV
season. Assuming a mean weight of eligible children of 6.0 kg., the
mean dose per patient would be 90 mg. We assumed that each
infant received 5 doses and that no drug wastage occurred. Thus,
the total direct per-infant cost of palivizumab per month was
assumed to be $1232 (90 mg ϫ $1369/100 mg) and for a single RSV
season was $6160 ($1232 ϫ 5 doses).

Administration Costs
Palivizumab is routinely administered in an outpatient setting.
We assumed that the first visit would require ϳ30 minutes of
physician time to see the patient and discuss RSV prophylaxis
along with 30 minutes of nursing time. The other 4 visits could be
managed by nursing staff and would require 30 minutes per visit.
Using 2002 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates from the US Department of Labor, we estimated pediatrician and nursing mean hourly wages at $68/hour and $24/hour,
respectively.15 Costs for physician wages therefore would be $34
(1 visit ϫ 0.5 hour/visit ϫ $68/hour) and nursing costs of $60 (5
visits ϫ 0.5 hour/visit ϫ $24/hour). We considered overhead
allocation and office staff time to be negligible, thus biasing toward prophylaxis. Total administration costs per infant per RSV
season totaled $94.

Hospitalization for RSV
Cost estimates were obtained from a retrospective analysis of
infants who were admitted to 10 children’s hospitals with a principal diagnoses of bronchiolitis (International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision code 466.1) and RSV pneumonia (International
Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision code 480.1).16 The study
included children with CHD (7.8%), preterm birth (19.6%), history
of wheezing (9.3%), and history of hospitalization (11.3%). The 10
centers all were tertiary care hospitals with pediatric residency
programs and pediatric ICUs. In this series, the average length of
stay was 4.5 Ϯ 4.2 days, and average hospital costs were $6789 or
$1508/day ($6789/4.5 days). Admission to an ICU resulted in
greater costs. In our present analysis, we adjusted number of ICU
days with ICU costs being calculated at 2.5 ϫ non-ICU costs on the
basis of published pediatric and adult literature.17,18 For comparison, cost of RSV admission was determined from 2 additional
sources: the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and a previous report
that analyzed health maintenance organization data.7,19,20 The cost
per day of RSV hospitalization from these 2 additional sources
were $1675 and $1607, respectively, comparable to the 10-center
data used for calculations in the present study.

Indirect Costs
Administration of Prophylaxis
For each office visit, we assumed that 1 parent accompanied the
infant and that 3 hours of work would be missed. Using the US
Bureau of Labor and Statistics 2002 average wage of $17/hour, lost
wages during 1 RSV season would have an indirect cost of $255 (3
hours/visit ϫ 5 visits ϫ $17/hour). In addition, travel costs were
estimated at $54 using the 2002 Internal Revenue Service mileage
reimbursement rate of $0.365 per mile and assuming that on
average a family traveled 30 miles round trip to each office visit
($0.365/mile ϫ 30 miles ϫ 5 visits).

Hospitalization for RSV
For each hospitalization, we assumed that 1 parent stayed with
the infant at all times. We calculated the average length of stay for
the treated group as 10.7 days and 13.3 days for the group that was
not treated. Considering that 5 of every 7 days are workdays, the
estimated work-loss cost therefore was $1039 for a parent of an
infant who received prophylaxis ($17/hour ϫ 8 hours/day ϫ 10.7
days/hospital ϫ 5/7) and $1292 ($17/hour ϫ 8 hours/day ϫ 13.3
days/hospital ϫ 5/7) for a parent of a child who did not receive
treatment.

Probability of Death, if Hospitalized for RSV
The multicenter trial reported by Feltes et al4 did not demonstrate a significant difference in mortality rate (3.3% vs 4.2%; P ϭ
.46) for patients who received palivizumab versus placebo. There
also was not a significant difference in RSV-related adverse events.
However, the aforementioned trial was designed to detect a difference in hospital admissions and may not have been sufficiently
powered to detect a difference in RSV-related mortality. Previous
studies have shown, however, that mortality for children who
have CHD and are hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis is higher
than for children without CHD. Historical studies reported mortality of 37% for patients who had CHD and were admitted with
bronchiolitis.21 Recent studies, however, have reported that hospital mortality for children who have CHD and are admitted with
RSV bronchiolitis is between 1.6% and 3.4%.1,2 For purposes of
cost-utility analysis, we constructed a model that assumed that the
mortality rate for patients who are admitted to the hospital would
be 3% whether they had received palivizumab or not. This assumption is based in part on the finding that the for patients who
have CHD and were admitted for RSV bronchiolitis, there was no
significant difference in need for ICU admission or need for mechanical ventilation between those who received palivizumab and
control subjects (P ϭ .98 and P ϭ .88, respectively). Therefore, the
difference in hospital admission rate for RSV bronchiolitis between the 2 groups (5.3% vs 9.7%) would result in a 0.13% reduction in overall mortality in our model.

Cost-Utility Analysis
Utility data (to evaluate the quality of life) in children and
adults with CHD are lacking. However, to make comparisons
between palivizumab prophylaxis and other public health interventions, we extrapolated data from adults with congestive heart
failure (CHF) to the CHD population. Although the prevalence of
CHF in CHD survivors is not well defined, there is abundant
literature on exercise performance in adolescent and adult CHD
patients. For the purposes of this study, we assigned an adult CHF
utility to patients with CHD lesions that result in long-term exercise limitation as previously reported.22 The lesions with longterm exercise limitations are indicated in Table 1. Patients with
lesions such as ventricular septal defect (with no significant longterm exercise limitations) are assigned a utility of 1.0. The utility
for CHF was based on the Beaver Dam Health Outcomes Study,
which evaluates health with the method of time tradeoffs.23 The
utility of CHF from this study is 0.71. Because the utility of CHF
can varying on the basis of method, we varied the CHF utility
from 0.5 to 1.0 in the sensitivity analysis.

tion.1 However, given the improved surgical results in the past 2
decades, accurate actuarial projections do not exist. Therefore, we
assumed that the average life expectancy of infants in the cohort
was 77.2 years, the US average life expectancy in 2002.24 The
assumption that children with CHD will have a regular life span
biases our model toward improved cost utility. Using the average
age of 0.55 years from an industry-sponsored trial, we calculated
that 76.65 life-years would be lost for each infant death (77.2 years
Ϫ 0.55 years).

Discount Rate
All future costs and benefits are discounted at a rate of 3%.
Discounting is used to calculate life-years lost.

Sensitivity Analysis
For cost-utility analysis, we evaluated the sensitivity of the
model to variations in key assumptions over various ranges. We
varied the hospital mortality for RSV bronchiolitis in CHD patients from 1% to 5%. We also varied the utility of CHF (exercise
limitation) in patients with CHD from 0.50 to 1.0. The published
data have not shown that palivizumab prophylaxis reduces hospital mortality for patients who have CHD and are admitted with
RSV bronchiolitis.4 However, because the aforementioned study
was not designed to detect such a benefit, we explored the possibility that palivizumab might reduce hospital mortality by 0% to
50% in the sensitivity analysis.

RESULTS

Costs of prophylaxis and hospitalization are summarized in Table 2. The total cost of palivizumab
prophylaxis for a single patient for 1 RSV season was
$6160. The strategy of palivizumab prophylaxis resulted in a net loss of $20 415 753 per 5000 patients
when one considers the direct and indirect costs of
prophylaxis and hospitalization. The cost of administering the prophylaxis regimen to prevent 1 day of
hospitalization was $4600 —nearly 3 times the cost of
1 day in the hospital.
Cost-utility analysis is shown in Table 3. These
results assume that CHD patients with long-term
exercise intolerance have utility of 0.71 and a hospital
mortality of 3% for an RSV admission. Cost per

life-year saved (discounted) was $100 338, and the
cost of quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved (discounted) was $114 337.
Sensitivity analysis varying the utility for CHF in
the CHD patients from 0.5 to 1.0 and varying the
hospital mortality from 1% to 5% is shown in Fig 1.
Cost utility varied from $60 233 to $382 675 per
QALY saved. Varying the assumptions regarding
utility for CHF (exercise limitation) had a relatively
minor impact on cost of QALY saved: $100 388 to
$127 558, assuming 3% hospital mortality. Varying
hospital mortality from 1% to 5% for RSV bronchiolitis admission had a more profound impact in cost
of QALY saved: $68 602 to $343 012, assuming a CHF
utility of 0.71. If palivizumab not only reduced the
risk of hospital admission for RSV bronchiolitis but
also reduced mortality for patients who have CHD
and are admitted, then the cost utility of palivizumab
becomes more favorable. If one were to assume a
hospital mortality of 3% for RSV bronchiolitis and
that patients who receive palivizumab were to have
50% lower hospital mortality, then the cost per
QALY saved would be $57 169 (Fig 2).
DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first published analysis of the economic implications of palivizumab in
the CHD population. The present study demonstrates that the cost of routine use of palivizumab in

young children with hemodynamically significant
CHD is relatively high for the benefit gained. Palivizumab does not result in cost savings with respect to
direct and indirect costs of RSV hospitalization. Only
if one assumes that palivizumab lowers the risk of
in-hospital mortality for those who have CHD and
are admitted for RSV (a potential benefit not confirmed by the published literature) does the costutility approach conventionally accepted bounds of
cost-effectiveness.25
A number of previous investigators have attempted to analyze the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in other high-risk groups. Greatest attention
has been focused on very low birth weight infants,
who have been reported to have a higher hospital
mortality than CHD patients.26 Even in patients with
relatively high hospital mortality and preexisting parenchymal lung disease, a number of investigators
have questioned the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab.7,8,27,28 Joffe et al7 reported that the cost of
life-year saved ranged from $110 000 to $1 200 000
(1995 US dollars). However, they reported that administration of palivizumab to a high-risk subset of
patients (those who are born at Ͻ32 weeks’ gestation

and require supplemental oxygen Ն28 days) yielded
a cost of $33 000 per life-year saved. Roeckl-Wiedmann et al8 analyzed the cost implications of RSV
prophylaxis for premature infants. This study reported that the cost per hospitalization avoided were
Euro 25 288 to Euro 204 684 (US currency: $25 529 to
$198 543). Even in the highest risk groups, palivizumab did not result in hospital cost savings.
A number of criticisms have been put forth regarding the cost-effectiveness studies addressing palivizumab. Most studies, including our own, have not
included the additional costs of RSV bronchiolitis
that is treated on an outpatient basis. This is attributable in part to the difficulty in differentiating RSV
upper respiratory infection from other viral entities.
As such, data regarding the outpatient costs of RSV
are limited. A recent analysis of RSV bronchiolitis in
Canada suggested that expenditures for ambulatory
patients accounted for 38% of direct costs.29 However, Ͻ1% of the entire infant population with an
RSV infection required hospital admission. Therefore, on a per-patient basis, the direct costs of a single
outpatient RSV infection is Ͻ2% of the cost of an
RSV-related hospital admission and composes a rel-

atively small portion of the overall direct costs in a
targeted high-risk group such as the CHD population. The indirect costs of an outpatient case of RSV
are less well defined and represent a limitation of the
current study design.
An additional element of cost-effectiveness analysis engendering controversy has been the determination of indirect cost for hospitalization of a child.
Nearly all analysis will include the impact of lost
wages during hospitalization. However, there might
also be additional lost wages after hospitalization.
Leader et al30 suggested that the total average economic burden for a family per bronchiolitis admission was $4517 for premature and $2135 for term
infants, including the value of lost productivity but
excluding inpatient hospital and physician bills and
lost income. An alternative approach is to perform
contingent valuation of willingness-to-pay estimates
of an individual, such as the value that the parent
places on avoiding a hospitalization. In a previous
study, Robbins et al31 reported that the parental willingness-to-pay estimate to avoid an RSV-related admission ranged from $1325 to $8700. However, concerns have been raised about the validity of such
responses, especially by noneconomists.32
In the present study, we undertook a cost-utility
analysis. The advantage of such an approach is that
it allows one to make comparisons with other public
health interventions. Unlike in many adult conditions for which there is abundant and reliable actuarial data, the life expectancy for children who were
born with CHD in 2003 cannot be easily defined. In
the present study, we assumed a normal life expectancy for all CHD patients. Although published data
suggest that survival for some lesions such as repaired ventricular septal defect may be normal or
near normal, other lesions have been associated with
a reasonable risk for childhood mortality.1 Children
with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and other
forms of single ventricle have been reported to have
a median survival of Ͻ10 years in some studies.33 In
addition, utility data analyzing the quality of life in
children with CHD are lacking. For the purposes of
this study, we attempted to link long-term exercise
intolerance to adult measures of utility in the setting
of CHF.34 Although such assumptions have clear
limitations, it should be recognized that in the
present cost-utility analysis, the majority (58%) of
patients were considered to have a utility of 1.0, and
varying utility assumption did not profoundly alter
cost of QALY saved results.
Other potential beneficial effects of palivizumab
beyond its impact on length of hospital stay must be
addressed in a cost-utility analysis. The present
study assumes that palivizumab does confer any
benefit outside the single RSV season. It is possible
that patients with CHD might have adverse longterm effects of an RSV infection. It has previously
been suggested that open-heart surgery be delayed 6
weeks after an RSV infection.35 Other investigators
suggested that RSV bronchiolitis frequently resulted
in the need to delay surgical procedures, which
might result in poor growth and protracted cyanosis.
It is interesting that in the multicenter trial, there was
1610

no association between palivizumab prophylaxis
and the need to delay or cancel heart surgery.
Whether an RSV infection has long-term implications
for lung function in the CHD population is not
known. It has been shown, however, that pulmonary
function abnormalities are seldom determinants of
later functional capacity in the CHD population.36
Although CHD is relatively rare (8/1000 live
births) and the number of CHD patients who might
be candidates is even less, the economic implications
of the AAP Committee recommendations do have
significant implications. Assuming that each year in
the United States 3000 children who have critical
CHD might be candidates for palivizumab and it
may be administered into the second year of life, the
overall cost of medication alone in the United States
in 1 year could exceed $30 000 000. In the current
economic climate, careful appraisal of the economic
implications of palivizumab is mandatory. Additional data derived from the industry-sponsored
trial, such as identification of potentially high-risk
lesions such as single ventricle patients or defining a
subset of heart patients such as those with acyanotic
lesions, may help to refine the AAP recommendations and make better use of this potentially lifesaving yet costly resource. In addition, given the
relatively widespread use of palivizumab in the
CHD population, it will be important to analyze how
well practitioners are following published guidelines
regarding RSV prophylaxis.

EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS OF BLINDING IN CLINICAL TRIALS IS SCANT

“The success of blinding in placebo controlled trials is not well reported, and
when it is reported it is often poor. . . . The authors evaluated 191 randomized
placebo controlled double blind trials published between 1998 and 201 in 9 general
medicine or psychiatry journals. They found that only 15 trials (8%) provided
information on the success of blinding, and that it was successful in only 5 trials.
The validity of double blinding was reported in only 4 of the 191 articles.”

a random sample of randomised, placebo controlled trials. BMJ. 2004;328:432
