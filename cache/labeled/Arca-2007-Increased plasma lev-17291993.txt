Abstract
Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL), the most common inherited disorder of lipid metabolism, is associated with an increased risk of
atherosclerosis that is not fully explained by the metabolic disturbances of these patients. Oxidative damage to lipid components accumulating in the
plasma of FCHL patients might contribute to explaining this lack of evidence. Cholesterol is one of the preferential targets of oxidation in LDL and
this may contribute to setting a proatherogenetic phenotype in FCHL. We investigated plasma oxysterols (7-ketocholesterol and 7βhydroxycholesterol) and α-tocopherol as in vivo hallmarks of lipid-related oxidative stress. Oxidative stress hallmarks were measured in <n>45</n> FCHL
patients and 54 sex- and age-matched healthy controls; in FCHL patients, oxidative stress and lipid profile parameters were also assessed in response
to lipid-lowering drugs in a 24-week randomized, open-label trial with atorvastatin or fenofibrate. FCHL patients showed markedly increased levels
of oxysterols (p < 0.001) and reduced α-tocopherol/total lipids (p < 0.001) compared to controls. These differences were independent of the presence
of clinical atherosclerosis and persisted after correction for hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin and fenofibrate significantly improved the lipid profile and
caused a comparable decrease in plasma oxysterols, with the normalization of 7-ketocholesterol and a significant reduction of 7β-hydroxycholesterol
(p < 0.001). These drugs also decreased the ratio of α-tocopherol/total lipids by more than 30% (p < 0.001). In conclusion, FCHL patients showed
increased hallmarks of cholesterol oxidation and decreased levels of α-tocopherol/total lipids. Atorvastatin and fenofibrate displayed comparable
efficiency in decreasing oxysterols, but they further decreased lipid-corrected α-tocopherol levels in plasma. More research work is needed to
understand the clinical meaning of these findings, which may help to understand the role of oxidative stress in FCHL and lipid-lowering therapy.

Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL), the most commonly inherited disorder of lipid metabolism [1,2], is characterized by elevated very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and/or
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations [3]. Other common features of FCHL are reduced high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentrations, and a preponderance of atherogenic, small dense

LDL (sdLDL) subfractions [4]. It is a common belief that FCHL
is the most atherogenic dyslipidemia and is responsible for
>10% of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) cases.
Moreover, recent studies have established that FCHL individuals show about a twofold higher relative risk of CAD [5,6] and
that this difference is not fully explained by the lipid
abnormalities commonly seen in these patients [6].
Oxidative modification greatly increases the atherogenicity of
LDL [7] and in vitro studies revealed that sdLDL particles are
more prone to oxidative modification than buoyant LDLs [8,9].
Therefore, it has been postulated that FCHL individuals are at

M. Arca et al. / Free Radical Biology & Medicine 42 (2007) 698–705

increased oxidative risk because of the abundance of sdLDL in
their plasma [10,11]. A study in members of Finnish FCHL
families, however, failed to demonstrate that LDL oxidation is
associated with carotid artery intima-media thickness, an index
of vascular damage [12]. Thus, the biochemical pathways
leading to increased cardiovascular risk in FCHL need to be
clearly identified.
7β-Hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol, oxidized
forms of cholesterol (oxysterols) (Fig. 1), produced by a free
radical-catalyzed mechanism, are the main bioactive class of
oxidized lipids produced during LDL oxidation and have
several biological activities relevant to atherogenesis, including
impairment of endothelial function [13], cytotoxicity [14],
apoptosis [15], monocyte differentiation and foam cell formation [16], and inhibition of cellular cholesterol deloading [17].
Moreover, increased plasma levels of oxysterols are found in
patients with severe carotid stenosis [18] and are associated with
an accelerated progression of carotid atherosclerosis [19]. 7βHydroxycholesterol was also found to be elevated in smokers
compared with nonsmokers [20].
We investigated whether FCHL patients show a condition of
oxidative stress as tested by the presence of increased levels of
7β-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol. We postulate that
these two oxidation products of cholesterol could be the
appropriate markers due to the well-known derangement of
cholesterol metabolism present in FCHL patients [4]. Because
oxidative stress is potentially influenced by antioxidant intake
and bioactivity [21], and α-tocopherol is greatly decreased in
patients with advanced carotid atherosclerosis [18], we further
tested whether patients with FCHL might have impaired αtocopherol levels. Finally, we monitored changes in plasma
levels of oxysterols and α-tocopherol in response to two
different drugs, atorvastatin and fenofibrate. These drugs have
different mechanisms of action and were used as a pharmaco-

699

logical tool to elucidate the potential causes of altered oxidative
stress/antioxidant status.
Methods
Patients
The study included 45 patients with FCHL selected from
kindred identified in the framework of a genetic study [22] and
diagnosed according to previously reported consensus criteria
[22–24]. Exclusion criteria were thyroid and liver disease, renal
insufficiency and proteinuria, obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2), poorly
controlled diabetes mellitus (blood glucose >120 mg/dl and/or
glycosylated hemoglobin >6.0%), and lipid-lowering drugs. For
comparison a control population composed of 54 age- and sexmatched healthy and normolipidemic subjects were assessed.
None of the FCHL patients or controls had taken any supplements containing vitamin E, vitamin C, carotenoids, or iron
in the previous 30 days.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee and all
subjects gave written informed consent to participate in the
study.
Drug treatment protocol
The drug study was designed as a randomized, open-label
trial. FCHL patients entered a washout phase in which they
were instructed to maintain a standard lipid-lowering diet
equivalent to the AHA or NECP Step 1 Diet for 6 weeks
before the baseline blood analysis. Thereafter, they were
randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg atorvastatin (n =
23) or 200 mg fenofibrate (n = 22) daily. Follow-up visits
were scheduled at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks during the active
treatment period. Atorvastatin dosage was, if necessary,
doubled at each visit (up to 80 mg/day) with the goal of
reducing LDL cholesterol to below 130 mg/dl (<100 mg/dl in
patients with history of coronary artery disease); conversely a
fixed dose of fenofibrate of 200 mg/day was used throughout
the trial.
Lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein analysis
Blood samples were collected after overnight fasting in
EDTA-containing tubes. Lipoproteins were isolated from fresh
plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation [25,26].
Plasma and lipoprotein fractions were assayed for total
cholesterol and triglyceride levels using enzymatic reagents
[27]. Total plasma apoB was measured by an immunoturbidimetric method (Kone Instruments, Espoo, Finland). For the
purpose of the present analysis, only baseline, 6-week, and 24week lipid and lipoprotein values were reported. ApoE
genotype was determined as reported [22].

Plasma oxysterols were measured by mass spectrometry,

Plasma levels of α-tocopherol were analyzed by HPLC as
previously described [21] and expressed as both mg/dl and mg/g
total lipids (cholesterol + triglycerides) [29,30]. As plasma
levels of oxysterols might be related to higher cholesterol
levels in FCHL, their values were adjusted for LDL-C levels.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ± SD or as percentages. Baseline
and posttreatment parameters were compared using a Student t
test for unpaired data once normality was demonstrated
(Shapiro–Wilks test) or a Mann–Whitney or Wilcoxon test for
nonparametric variables. Categorical variables were analyzed by
χ2 test.
To identify determinants of plasma concentrations of
oxysterols, linear correlations between lipids, uric acid, and
α-tocopherol in FCHL and controls were first estimated by
Pearson’s test. Regression models were developed with age,
sex, BMI, smoking, diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease
(CVD), hypertension, uric acid, and α-tocopherol; and lipid
parameters were included as independent variables.
Results
Clinical characteristics of FCHL patients and controls
The clinical characteristics of the study groups are described
in Table 1. There were no differences in age, sex, or smoking
habits between FCHL patients and healthy controls. Compared
to controls, higher prevalences of hypertension (p < 0.001) and
diabetes mellitus (p = 0.054) and a history of cardiovascular
disease (p < 0.001) were observed among FCHL subjects.
Accordingly, 17 FCHL patients were taking antihypertensive
drugs (mostly Ca2+ -channel blockers), 13 antiplatelets, 6
nitrates, and 4 oral hypoglycemic drugs.
Hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (apoB >130 mg/dl) was the
most common lipid phenotype in FCHL, with a mean value of
158.6 ± 24.9 (mg/dl, mean ± SD).

Oxysterols and α-tocopherol in FCHL patients and controls
The comparisons of plasma parameters between FCHL and
healthy controls are reported in Table 2. FCHL patients showed
very high plasma concentrations of 7β-hydroxycholesterol and
7-ketocholesterol relative to controls that persisted even after
adjustment for LDL cholesterol levels or exclusion of FCHL
patients with a history of CVD (data not shown). Absolute
plasma α-tocopherol levels were higher in FCHL patients
compared to controls, but after correction for total lipid levels,
α-tocopherol was significantly lower in FCHL patients than in
controls (Table 2). This difference persisted also after correcting
α-tocopherol for LDL-cholesterol. No difference in uric acid
levels was observed between the two groups.
In the control and FCHL groups, we found no significant
correlations between plasma levels of oxysterols and age, sex,
BMI, smoking, diabetes, history of CVD, hypertension, or αtocopherol levels. Interestingly, in the FCHL group, plasma
levels of uric acid showed a significant, inverse correlation with
both 7β-hydroxycholesterol (r = − 0.349, p = 0.01) and 7ketocholesterol concentrations (r = − 0.257, p = 0.046). In
normolipidemic controls, baseline plasma α-tocopherol levels
were significantly correlated with total cholesterol (TC) (r =
0.47, p < 0.001), LDL-C (r = 0.49, p < 0.001), and total lipids
(TC + triglycerides (TG)) (r = 0.29, p = 0.015), but not with TG;
in FCHL baseline plasma α-tocopherol levels significantly
correlated with TC (r = 0.45, p < 0.001), TG (r = 0.39, p =
0.04), and total lipids (TC + TG) (r = 0.51, p = 0.001), but not
with LDL-C.

Effects of lipid-lowering treatment on plasma lipids and
lipoprotein fractions
At baseline there was no significant difference between
atorvastatin and fenofibrate groups for plasma oxysterols,
α-tocopherol, and plasma lipids (total cholesterol, and its
subfractions, and TG). In the atorvastatin group, nine patients
needed up-titration to 20 mg/day and four patients to 40 mg/
day between week 6 and week 18. No patients required the
dose of 80 mg/day. Therefore, the average dose of
atorvastatin was maintained at 20.2 mg/day between weeks
18 and 24.
The effects of atorvastatin and fenofibrate on lipid parameters are reported in Table 3. At the end of the follow-up
period, atorvastatin produced a significant (p < 0.001) reduction
in cholesterol and triglycerides in the LDL and VLDL + IDL
fractions. Conversely, no change was observed in HDL-C
levels. The reduction of LDL was mainly the result of the
decrease in larger, more buoyant LDL (−40.3%, p < 0.001),
whereas denser LDL remained almost unchanged. Atorvastatin
also caused a significant decrease (p < 0.001) in plasma levels of
total apoB. Fenofibrate resulted in a significant reduction in
plasma concentrations of both VLDL + IDL and LDL fractions,
but not in a significant increase (+12.3%) in plasma HDL-C.

701

Moreover, fenofibrate reduced both the LDL subfractions
(−14.2% light and −24.8% sdLDL, in terms of cholesterol
levels), even though the effect on sdLDL was significant only
after 6 weeks of treatment. Plasma concentration of total apoB
decreased by 23.1% (p < 0.001) during fenofibrate treatment.
As far as the type of lipid-lowering regimen is concerned,
atorvastatin compared to fenofibrate induced a more pronounced reduction in TC (−28.8 ± 11.6% vs −19.7 ± 9.8%,
mean ± SD, p = 0.01) and LDL-C concentrations (−36.1 ±
13.3% vs −17.9 ± 20.3%, mean ± SD, p = 0.002), but not in
apoB levels (−24.3 ± 15.9% vs −21.2 ± 16.9%, mean ± SD, p =
0.548). Conversely, the decrease in TG concentrations was
greater in response to fenofibrate than to atorvastatin (−44.7 ±
21.0% vs −25.9 ± 26.9%, respectively, mean ± SD, p = 0.017).
Fenofibrate significantly increased HDL-C levels compared to
atorvastatin (+16.4 ± 27.6% vs +1.3 ± 16.2%, mean ± SD, p =
0.038). Atorvastatin had no effect on sdLDL, whereas
fenofibrate affected both LDL subfractions, although the effect
on sdLDL was significant only at week 6. As early as the sixth
week of treatment, atorvastatin showed significant reducing
effects on TC and LDL-C with a further small, nonsignificant,
decrease after 24 weeks of treatment. Atorvastatin significantly
reduced TG levels after 24 weeks of treatment. Fenofibrate
reduced TC and TG and increased HDL-C levels at 6 weeks,

Effects of lipid-lowering treatment on plasma oxysterols and
α-tocopherol
Both atorvastatin and fenofibrate treatments induced a
progressive and significant reduction in plasma oxysterols
(Fig. 1). In the atorvastatin group at study completion, 7βhydroxycholesterol had fallen from 19.5 to 10.9 ng/ml (−44%,
p = 0.033) and 7-ketocholesterol from 27.6 to 13.0 ng/ml
(−52%, p < 0.001). Thus, values of 7-ketocholesterol
approached levels seen in normolipidemic controls, whereas
those of 7β-hydroxycholesterol remained higher compared to
controls (p < 0.001). A significant reduction in oxysterols was
observed as early as the sixth week of treatment; at that point,
plasma levels of 7β-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol
were reduced by 26 and 24%, respectively (Fig. 2). The time
course of oxysterol changes during the trial was slightly
different if analyzed as the oxysterol/LDL-C ratio. Both 7βhydroxycholesterol/LDL-C and 7-ketocholestrol/LDL-C ratios
increased at 6 weeks (+13 and +15%, p < 0.05, respectively),

but they significantly decreased by 15 (p < 0.05) and 27% (p =
0.01) at 24 weeks, respectively.
In the fenofibrate group after 24 weeks, plasma concentrations of 7β-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol decreased
from 15.8 to 7.7 ng/ml (−51%, p = 0.002) and from 23.3 to
10.7 ng/ml (−54%, p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 2). A
significant reduction in oxysterol values was observed as early
as the 6-week follow-up; at that point, 7β-hydroxycholesterol
and 7-ketocholestereol were reduced by 25 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 2). At the end of the treatment, plasma concentrations
of 7-ketocholesterol approached levels observed in normolipidemic controls, whereas 7β-hydroxycholesterol remained significantly high (p = 0.005). In the fenofibrate group, the profile of
oxysterol/LDL-C ratios showed a progressive decrease throughout the trial. The 7β-hydroxycholesterol/LDL-C ratio changed
by −21.2% after 6 weeks and by −41.4% (p = 0.004) after
24 weeks. 7-Ketocholesterol/LDL-C changed by −12% after
6 weeks and by −41.9% (p = 0.001) after 24 weeks of treatment.
As far as changes in plasma α-tocopherol are concerned, a
progressive and comparable reduction in absolute plasma αtocopherol levels was observed during the follow-up in the two
treatment groups (Fig. 3). After 24 weeks of treatment, the mean
plasma concentration of α-tocopherol decreased by 58 (p <

0.001) and 54% (p < 0.001) in the atorvastatin and fenofibrate
groups, respectively. These drugs produced a similar, but
smaller, decrease in the α-tocopherol/total lipids (35% with a
p value of <0.001 and 33% with p = 0.01, respectively) and in
α-tocopherol/LDL-C (30% with p < 0.001 and 40% with p =
0.005, respectively). At the end of treatment, both atorvastatin
and fenofibrate lowered plasma α-tocopherol significantly
below the level observed in normolipidemic controls (p <
0.001).
Discussion
In this study we showed that, compared to normolipidemic
controls, FCHL patients exhibit large increases in plasma levels
of the two oxysterols 7β-hydroxycholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol. This seems to occur independent of the presence of
clinical atherosclerosis and LDL-C levels. Our findings strongly
indicate that patients with FCHL are prone to a condition of
oxidative stress as shown by the presence of increased levels of
free radical-driven cholesterol oxidation products (oxysterols).
This is the first in vivo evidence supporting the finding obtained
by other authors of an increased in vitro susceptibility to
oxidation of LDL subfraction in FCHL patients [11,12].
The finding that free radical-mediated cholesterol oxidation
products are increased in FCHL patients, a condition of
cholesterol metabolism derangement, is of clinical relevance
and the upregulated oxidative stress should be taken into account
to explain the increased cardiovascular risk in these patients.
Our data do not support the hypothesis of a role for sdLDL in
oxidative risk [10] because we did not find any correlation
between oxysterols and denser LDL. The 6-week-point reduction of sdLDL during fenofibrate treatment is difficult to explain
and should be considered with caution as it may be only an
analytical bias. The possibility that FCHL patients have
increased plasma oxysterol levels as a consequence of increased
absorption of oxysterols of dietary origin cannot be excluded. In
contrast with this, we have not found any increase in plasma 7βhydroxycholesterol or 7-ketocholesterol after meals (unpublished data).
Moreover, we and others have reported that plasma oxysterol
levels might be significantly influenced by vitamin E [20,21],
and measurement of α-tocopherol is appropriate for correctly
studying the oxidant/antioxidant balance at the plasma and
tissue levels [28]. In agreement with Liu et al. [12], who found
levels 50% higher in affected compared to unaffected FCHL
family members, we showed increased levels of plasma αtocopherol in our group of FCHL patients. These observations
seem to conflict with the finding of increased oxidative stress in
FCHL patients that should be associated with a consumption of
protective antioxidants; but, it is well known that absolute
concentrations of α-tocopherol correlate with plasma lipids, and
hyperlipidemia is commonly associated with increased levels of
α-tocopherol [29]. However, α-tocopherol concentrations may
be lower than control levels if adjusted for lipid concentrations,
which is recommended as standard procedure to express plasma
α-tocopherol status [30]. Indeed, by adjusting α-tocopherol for
total lipids (cholesterol plus triglycerides), we found that its

703

levels were lower in FCHL patients than in controls. Looking at
the values of corrected α-tocopherol, it is evident that
triglycerides and, in turn, VLDL have a major role in controlling
α-tocopherol levels of FCHL patients. Taken together, these
data are consistent with the occurrence of an increased exposure
to oxidative stress in FCHL patients (e.g., lowered αtocopherol/lipid ratio and raised cholesterol oxidation products
in the circulation).
We further investigated the potential link between an increased
in vivo oxidative damage and altered lipid levels in FCHL by
measuring the response of oxysterols and α-tocopherol to longterm lipid-lowering therapy. We used atorvastatin and fenofibrate,
which influence lipid homeostasis by different mechanisms, with
atorvastatin acting on cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the
enzyme HMCoA-reductase and fenofibrate stimulating the
PPARγ-mediated lipid metabolism in the liver [31].
As expected, atorvastatin produced a more pronounced
reduction of TC and LDL-C levels, whereas fenofibrate was
more effective in reducing TG-rich lipoprotein fractions and
increasing HDL-C. In contrast to fenofibrate, atorvastatin did not
show any effect on the denser LDL subfraction. Lipid reduction
was associated with a progressive and time-dependent decrease
in plasma oxysterols. After 24 weeks of treatment, 7ketocholesterol decreased to the normal range, whereas 7βhydroxycholesterol persisted at levels slightly higher than
controls. Atorvastatin and fenofibrate caused a similar decrease
in oxysterols.
The mechanism by which atorvastatin and fenofibrate
reduced oxidative stress in FCHL patients deserves further
consideration. The two drugs operate through different
mechanisms but produced comparable effects on lipid profiles
and oxidative stress, suggesting that these two targets are
closely connected. Atorvastatin and fenofibrate also have
different structures, and it is unlikely that the effects on
oxidative stress were dependent on putative antioxidant action,
which is usually implied when markers of oxidative stress are
reduced by treatments.
However, results from previous studies have reported that
statins may reduce indices of oxidative stress—reviewed in
Rosenson et al. [32]—and fluvastatin therapy has been shown to
decrease plasma oxysterols levels in type 2 diabetic patients with
hyperlipidemia [33]. The reduction of oxidative stress indices in
a complex system does not necessarily confer direct antioxidant
activity on the drug responsible for the effect [34]. Indirect
(secondary) antioxidant-like effects elicited by these drugs
cannot be ruled out because the antioxidant activity of statins is
not substantiated by data on kinetic constants toward lipid
peroxidation, a prerequisite to attributing antioxidant activity to
a molecule [35]. Few and conflicting data are available on the
effect of fenofibrate on oxidative stress. Previous studies
reported that fenofibrate may exacerbate oxidative stress in
vitro and in vivo [35–38]. Our data are in accordance with recent
studies showing that this drug may protect LDL from oxidative
modification [39] and may enhance the expression of antioxidant enzymes through the PPARα pathway [40].
It is known that hyperlipidemic states are associated with
altered physical properties of cellular membranes [41], which

704

M. Arca et al. / Free Radical Biology & Medicine 42 (2007) 698–705

may facilitate the escape of free radicals from the mitochondrial
electron transport chain or the activation of NAPH oxidase [42].
In agreement with this hypothesis, studies in hypercholesterolemic rabbits have shown that oxidative stress may be reduced
by lipid lowering based on dietary intervention in the absence of
drugs [43]. Furthermore, it has been shown that in hypercholesterolemic patients, circulating levels of electronegative LDL, an
in vivo form of mildly oxidized LDL, can be reduced by
simvastatin, but no further decrease occurs with the addition of
α-tocopherol to the simvastatin regimen [44]. Taken together,
these data indicate that the improved lipid profile obtained with
therapy was the major determinant in reducing oxidative stress of
FCHL.
It can be suggested that the increased production of
oxysterols seen in FCHL individuals is the consequence of an
altered lipid status rather than the result of upregulated
cholesterol biosynthesis. An additional explanation could be
based on the mobilization of oxidized lipids favored by the
normalization of the lipid profile. Recently, it has been reported
that in patients with acute coronary syndromes, high-dose
atorvastatin reduces oxidized phospholipids present on apoB100 and increases levels of Lp(a) consistent with a mechanism
of mobilization and clearance of oxidized phospholipids [45].
An additional finding of this study was the significant
reduction of plasma α-tocopherol during treatment with both
atorvastatin and fenofibrate. This result may contrast with the
normalization of oxidative stress as assessed by oxysterol levels.
Reduction of plasma α-tocopherol has already been reported
during atorvastatin therapy [46]. It is unlikely that the reduction
of α-tocopherol by lipid-lowering therapy was dependent on
“remodeling” of LDL, the main carrier of α-tocopherol in
plasma, because both absolute and relative concentrations of αtocopherol decreased. The possibility that atorvastatin and
fenofibrate may affect α-tocopherol degradation [47] or the
mechanism involved in the incorporation of α-tocopherol into
lipoproteins [48] should also be considered. Whatever the cause,
the clinical significance of this unfavorable impact of lipidlowering therapy on plasma levels of α-tocopherol is unclear. αTocopherol has been shown to be an effective in vitro lipidrelated antioxidant even though its role as an effective in vivo
antioxidant remains to be proven. However, it is thought to have
a protective role in several disease states, and, in particular, it is
considered important in preventing chronic degenerative events
associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Intriguingly, induction of vitamin E deficiency in animals causes
several abnormalities also including rhabdomyolysis [49]. Thus,
reduction of α-tocopherol levels could be taken into account
when explaining damaging effects reported on muscle tissue
from lipid-lowering drugs [31].
In summary, we have demonstrated increased levels of
oxysterols, the hallmarks of oxidative stress and potentially
proatherogenic mediators, in FCHL patients. This finding was
associated with an impaired vitamin E status, which could
provide an additional mechanism to account for the higher risk
of premature atherosclerosis in FCHL. Treatment with atorvastatin or fenofibrate was associated with a reduction in plasma
oxysterol concentrations, showing the importance of lipid-

lowering itself in alleviating the pro-oxidant and proatherogenic
burden of FCHL patients. In addition, it was shown that both
lipid-lowering drugs produce a decrease in plasma α-tocopherol
levels. The clinical implications of this latter observation may
be potentially unfavorable and deserve further investigation.
