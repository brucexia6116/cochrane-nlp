Abstract
Background: The study was conducted to evaluate ethinyl estradiol (EE) or ibuprofen (IBU) compared to placebo (PL) on spotting and
bleeding (S/B) and a postcoital test (PCT) in women using the levonorgestrel subcutaneous implant. Women experiencing excessive S/B
were enrolled in a multicenter prospective randomized study using EE, IBU or PL.
Outcome Measures: Duration of S/B and a PCT were evaluated. Statistical analysis used a general linear model procedure with Duncan's
multiple range tests for individual variables.
Results: <n>One hundred seven</n> women were evaluated, and there was no difference in the duration of bleeding among the three therapies, while
the mean number of spotting days were 1.8 for EE and 2.8 for PL (p=.04). There was no effect of IBU on S/B. No effect on cervical mucus or
sperm was found between treatments.
Conclusion: There was a decrease in spotting but no effect on bleeding with EE compared to PL.

1. Introduction
The principal reason for discontinuation of hormonal
contraception is for unscheduled (irregular) endometrial
(uterine) spotting and bleeding (S/B). This is true for oral
combination (estrogen plus progestin) as well as inject☆

able or implantable progestin-only contraceptive methods
[1–5]. The exact causes of the irregular endometrial S/B
associated with continuous progestin-only hormonal
contraceptive methods are unknown [1,6]. Continuously
delivered progestin-only methods of contraception are
associated with a higher incidence of irregular bleeding
than intermittently or cyclic administered oral contraceptives. The overall incidence of irregular bleeding in
users of levonorgestrel subcutaneous implants (LNG SIs)
is variable depending on the study [3,7,8]. Normal cyclic
vaginal bleeding occurs in 25% of LNG SI participants
during the first year of use with prolonged bleeding in
10–20% [9].

The amount of blood loss associated with LNG SI is
negligible and does not result in any significant medical
problems such as anemia or the need for either diagnostic or
therapeutic surgical intervention. The consumer perceives
the occurrence and duration of the bleeding or spotting,
which is unscheduled and/or prolonged, as a significant
problem. Thus, the increased occurrence of unscheduled
and/or prolonged bleeding or spotting results in discontinuation of the method. Counseling regarding this side effect
before insertion of LNG SI results in improved compliance
and continuation with the method [10].
We have performed a pilot study using 20 mcg of ethinyl
estradiol (EE) for 10 days where we found a rapid cessation
of bleeding, within 3 days in 5 out of 10 volunteers [11].
These data resulted in our developing the current prospective
clinical trial using EE 20 mcg a day for 10 days or IBU
800 mg per day for 5 days versus placebo (PL) using a
double-blind double-dummy protocol. We have previously
published the results of an interim analysis of this study
without breaking the code to identify the medication [11].
We were not able to find a significant reduction in either
the bleeding or spotting days between any of the three
groups based on our interim analysis [11].
The current report is the final analysis of our data based
on the completion of the multicenter clinical trial and the
breaking of the code for the medication. The endpoint in this
trial was the efficacy of the treatment (EE, IBU) to reduce or
stop the occurrence, frequency or duration of S/B in women
using LNG SI for contraception. A secondary endpoint was
the findings on a standard postcoital test (PCT) performed at
the end of the treatment period in a subset of the participants.

The participant was in good general health with a negative
pregnancy test and no known medical problems that would
have contributed to the bleeding or spotting, and she
understood that there was a PL arm in the study. There
were no contraindications to the use of exogenous EE and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
Exclusion criteria were the following: unwillingness to
participate in a PL-controlled trial or keep a daily menstrual
diary card, any contraindication to estrogen or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), current frequent use of an
NSAID or previous treatment for S/B related to LNG-SI.
Current cigarette smoking was not a contraindication for
enrollment in the study.

2. Materials and methods

2.3. Medications

2.1. Participants

EE 20 mcg tablets and PL tablets of comparable size and
color were supplied by Schering Corporation, Kenilworth,
NJ. IBU 800 mg tablets and identical PL were supplied by

One hundred seven women who were users of LNG SI
and were experiencing irregular endometrial S/B were
invited to participate in this study. The protocol and
informed consents had been approved by the local
Institutional Review Board at each clinical site prior to
initiating the study. All participants were counseled prior to
enrollment in the study and had signed an informed consent.
A registered nurse serving as a clinical coordinator initially
interviewed each potential candidate to determine if all
inclusion and exclusion criteria were met. Following this,
the patient was enrolled and a medical history, complete
physical examination, urine pregnancy test and cervical
swabs for Neisseira gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis
were obtained by a physician.
The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were used
to determine eligibility of the participant: More than 1 month
should have elapsed since insertion of the LNG SI, with S/B
lasting eight or more consecutive days, or more than 10 days
out of 14 days within the preceding 3 weeks, and no
treatment for S/B within the preceding month.

2.2. Therapeutic interventions
This was a prospective randomized double-blind trial of
the following medications: EE 20 mcg administered daily for
10 days with 5 days of an IBU PL given twice a day;
ibuprofen (IBU) 400 mg twice a day orally for 5 days with
10 days of a daily EE PL; two PL tablets, one taken daily
for 10 days and the other taken concurrently twice a day for
the first 5 days of treatment. An overview of the clinical
study design is found in Fig. 1.
The participants were asked to return after the first
10 days of medication. If S/B was persistent, they were given
a second 10-day course of medication. If the S/B had stopped
or was reduced, the participants were given a second 10 days
of medication with instructions to restart the treatment if they
had more than eight consecutive days of S/B or 10 or more
days of S/B in a 14-day interval (see above). All participants
were seen on a monthly basis for 1 year or until S/B had
ceased for 2 months.

Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, MI. The tablets were
individually labeled with a site-specific and participantspecific order number.
All medication was prepackaged in individual lock-tight
containers. Each participant was provided with three
packages each containing two bottles with precounted
tablets. There were written instructions to take one tablet
daily from Bottle A for 10 days and simultaneously take two
tablets twice a day from Bottle B for 5 days. These
instructions were on the label of each bottle.

2.4. Randomization
Each of the five clinical sites was identified with an
individual site number. Each site was then provided with a
randomization list for the participant that was generated by
the Data Collecting Center, Dr. Philput. At each site, as the
patient was entered into the study, she was assigned a unique
patient order number (PON) and the appropriate treatment
medication that corresponded to the PON. The investigators
and clinical staff were all blinded to the dispensed study
medication.

2.5. Follow-up visits
Enrollment in the study was done at the first visit if the
participants met all criteria and had a normal physical
examination. Each participant was instructed to immediately
start the medication if she was experiencing bleeding at the
time of evaluation. If bleeding had not occurred in the past
2 days, participants were instructed to initiate the medication if they had at least seven or more days of spotting or
bleeding in a 14-day interval. All participants were asked to
return between Days 7 and 10 after initiating treatment.
At this return visit at the end of the 10-day treatment,
each participant was asked to have intercourse within 3 h
before the scheduled examination if possible. At this visit,
the diary cards were reviewed and a PCT was performed
(see Section 2.6). Each participant was then seen monthly
every 3 months when the diary cards were collected and
new diary cards and medication for another course of
treatment were provided.

evaluation of percentage of motile and nonmotile
sperm was made in 10 randomly selected highpowered fields.
Vaginal pH was determined using pH paper pressed
against the left vaginal wall approximately halfway
between the cervix and introitus.
A vaginal maturation index was estimated by
scraping cells from the lateral vaginal wall and
placing these on a glass slide. The percentage of
superficial, intermediate and basal cells present were
estimated after evaluation of 100 epithelial cells
using light microscopy.
The portio of the cervix was then wiped with a
cotton applicator to remove vaginal fluids. An
aspirette uterine sampler (Unimar Aspirette, Cooper
Surgical, Shelton, CT, USA) was inserted into the
external cervical os and advanced approximately
1.5 cm or less with negative pressure being applied.
The collected cervical mucus was scored for amount,
spinnbarkeit, ferning, viscosity and cellularity (leukocytes) from 0 to 3 using previously described criteria
[12]. Individual cervical mucus parameters would
receive a score of 3 for excellent and a score of 0 for
poor. A total score of 15 for these five parameters
would be excellent, and a score b7 would reflect poorquality cervical mucus.
A portion of the aspirated cervical mucus was placed
on a clean glass slide, coverslipped and evaluated for
the presence of spermatozoa. An initial scan at ×100
magnification was carried out to determine if
spermatozoa were indeed present. Following this,
five random fields were evaluated at ×400 to
determine the number of spermatozoa and their
motility, which was classified as (a) motile and
progressive, (b) motile and nonprogressive and (c)
nonmotile. The total number of sperm in the five
high-powered fields was then divided by 5 to arrive
at an average number per high-powered field.
If no spermatozoa were seen at ×100, this was recorded
as a negative PCT.

2.7. Outcome measures

All participants were asked to have intercourse within 3 h
before their end-of-treatment visit, which was carried out
between 7 and 10 days following initiation of treatment.
Persistent S/B or nonavailability of the partner would
potentially result in noncompliance for the PCT. The PCT
was performed in the following manner:

The primary outcome measure was the number of days of
vaginal (endometrial) S/B:

1. The participant was examined in the supine position
with a sterile vaginal speculum. The speculum was
inserted and the vaginal pool was aspirated; the
volume of fluid was determined using a conical
centrifuge tube with volumetric measurements. One
drop of this material was placed on a glass slide, and an

Each participant was counseled regarding the potential
changes in uterine (endometrial) bleeding. She was given
a diary card along with the treatment medication on
which she was to list all symptoms, the occurrence of
vaginal S/B and the number of pills taken each day.
Spotting was defined as a bloodstained vaginal discharge
that did not require the use of a sanitary protection.
Bleeding was any vaginal discharge that was blood-tinged
and required sanitary protection. Each participant used
her own subjective assessment of what amount of vaginal
discharge required protection.

D.F. Archer et al. / Contraception 78 (2008) 106–112

The secondary outcome measure was the result of
the PCT performed between Days 7 and 12 after
initiating treatment.

2.8. Data collection and analysis
All data were entered on specifically designed datacollecting instruments and forwarded to a central data entry
resource, directed by Dr. Philput. The S/B data were
analyzed to see if there were differences between groups,
for the following parameters:
1. Number of days of bleeding and/or spotting: from
Days 1 to 5, from Days 6 to 10, from Days 1 to 15 and
within the first 30 days following treatment.
2. Number of treatments used by the participants in each
treatment group during their enrollment in the study.
3. Presence or absence of spermatozoa in the cervical
mucus and the percentage of motility, as well as any
effects on cervical mucus parameters.

3. Results

The mean number of S/B days during Days 1–5 of
treatment was 1.1, 1.8 and 1.2 for EE, IBU and PL,
respectively. These results were not statistically different
among groups (see Table 2). From Day 6 to Day 10, there
were no differences found in mean S/B days between
treatments: 1.4, 0.9 and 1.0 for EE, IBU and PL, respectively
(see Table 2). There were no differences in mean S/B days
within each treatment (EE, IBU and PL) when Days 1–5
were compared to Days 6–10.
The mean number of S/B days was not different
among treatments during Days 1 to 15 after initiation of
therapy (see Table 2).

3.1. Volunteer demographics

3.3. S/B within the first 30 days after treatment

There were no differences in mean height, weight and
systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the participants
in each of the three treatment groups (Table 1). There were
106 participants whose data were available for analysis. The
number of volunteers in each arm of the study who had
complete data for analysis was 20 for EE, 42 for IBU and 44
for PL.

The mean number of bleeding days in the 30 days after
initiating therapy was 5.0, 4.3 and 3.6 for women receiving
EE, IBU and PL, respectively (see Table 3). There was no
statistical difference among treatments. The mean number of
spotting days during the 30 days was 1.1, 1.8 and 2.8 for EE,
IBU and PL, respectively. There was a statistically
significant difference between the EE and PL groups for
the reduction of spotting (p=.04) (see Table 3). There was no
difference between the IBU and PL groups for spotting.
The number of mean S/B days in the first 30 days after
treatment was 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4 for EE, IBU and PL,
respectively, and these results were not statistically different
(see Table 3).

Statistical analysis was carried out using a general linear
model procedure with Duncan's multiple range tests for
individual variables. A Mantel–Hansel chi-square test and
Fisher's Exact Test (two tailed) were performed on the
individual outcome variables.

3.2. S/B after initiation of treatment
The mean number of S/B days after treatment began
was evaluated between groups in several ways. The
cessation of endometrial S/B was considered to be an
acute response within 5 days after initiation of treatment;
an intermediate response, between 6 and 10 days after
initiation of therapy; and a late response, more than 10 days
after the onset of therapy.

3.4. Vaginal maturation index and pH
There were 32 observations of vaginal pH (13 for EE, 9
for IBU and 10 for PL) at the conclusion of the 10-day
treatment. Mean vaginal pH values were 6.5 for EE, 6.3 for
IBU and 5.8 for PL and were not statistically different
between treatment groups.
There were 86 observations in the data set for vaginal
maturation indices but only 61 were used due to
incomplete findings that were consistent across groups.
The mean vaginal maturation index was assessed as the
percentage of superficial, intermediate and basal cells for
each group at the time of the PCT, reported as mean values
(EE: 4.4, 31.7 and 16.1; IBU: 9.5, 35.5 and 16.1; PL: 6.5,
30.42 and 13.1, for superficial, intermediate and basal
cells, respectively). None of these results were statistically
different among treatment groups.
3.5. Postcoital test results
There were no differences in cervical mucus scores for
mean amount, spinnbarkeit, ferning, viscosity and cellularrity between the participants in any of the three treatment
groups (Table 4).
The mean cervical mucus scores were 4.5 for EE, 5.0 for
IBU and 3.5 for PL, which were considered to characterize
poor or hostile cervical mucus based on our scoring system.
The mean number of sperm present in five high-powered
fields was 6.5 for EE (n=8), 5.8 for IBU (n=5) and 5.7 for PL
(n=5). These findings were not statistically different among
the groups. Motile sperm were present in only four
participants. The EE group had one participant with a
mean of 8 motile sperm per five high-powered fields, and the
PL group had three participants with a mean of 7 motile
sperm per five high-powered fields.

4. Discussion
The nature of the bleeding problem associated with
progestin-only contraceptives is such that it is perceived as
relatively unimportant by the physician but is significant for
the consumer, resulting in premature discontinuation of the

method [3,7]. The primary reason for discontinuation of
progestational contraception is the high incidence of
irregular, frequent and sometimes prolonged vaginal S/B
[1,13]. This appears due to the fact that the incidence,
frequency and duration of this side effect improves (becomes
less) with the increased duration of LNG SI use [13].
Secondly, there is no clinical information that the S/B results
in any significant medical impairment such as anemia [3].
Third, it has been felt that the addition of a second hormone
(specifically estrogen) to the progestin-only regimen on a
regular and prolonged duration would result in a similar but
different form of combination oral contraception.
There is no clearly identified regimen of medical
management recommended to control the S/B in LNG SI
contraceptors [13]. A prior study of LNG SI users
experiencing S/B used four different intervention arms: EE
50 mcg per day for 20 days orally, IBU 800 mg three times a
day for 5 days, LNG 30 mcg twice a day for 20 days and PL
one tablet daily for 20 days [14]. There was a 40% reduction
in the total number of S/B days in women using EE
compared to PL over a 1-year period [14]. IBU reduced the
number of S/B days by 30%, compared to PL [14]. This
report highlighted the fact that the treatment does not result
in a “cure” since the number of refills for medication
averaged 3.8 per participant and, second, that the number of
days of S/B was 77 days for EE versus 129 days for PL in the
1 year of follow-up.
It is well known that most of the S/B occurs in the first
several months after insertion of the LNG SI, and the
incidence is reduced with time [3,9].
A prospective study of women identified by objective
assessment of excessive bleeding after LNG SI insertion
reported that the use of EE 50 mcg daily for 21 days of a 90-day
period significantly reduced the total number of S/B days
(38.0 vs. 19.2 S/B days) [15]. The number of S/B episodes
was unchanged. The number of S/B days per episode of
bleeding was reduced from 14.7 to 6.7 days [15].
A combination oral contraceptive (COC) has been
prescribed when bleeding has been a problem with LNG
SI in order to reduce the S/B and enhance compliance and
continuation [15,16]. The oral contraceptive preparations
used in these reports contained either (a) EE 50 mcg and
LNG 150 mcg or (b) EE 30 mcg and LNG 150 mcg and were
used only for 1 month [15,16]. The duration of the S/B
episodes was reduced with the use of COC. The authors did
not report data regarding the resumption or continuation of
the S/B after the discontinuation of the COCs.
We found no discernable effect on the duration of
bleeding immediately or within the first 30 days of
intervention with either EE or IBU compared to PL.
These data are in agreememt with other trials of estrogenonly regimen for the cessation of bleeding in women
using progestin-only contraception [13,17]. An exception
is a 1-year study that found a decrease in the mean
number of bleeding days with EE and IBU compared to
PL [14]. It is possible that the dose and the extended

D.F. Archer et al. / Contraception 78 (2008) 106–112

duration of the EE in this trial did control the S/B similar
to the findings of reduced breakthrough bleeding with
continued use of cyclic COC [18,19]. Our expectation
that a reduction in the dose and duration of EE to 20 mcg
for 10 days could improve the S/B pattern was not
successful in decreasing the duration of bleeding and only
marginally effective in reducing the duration of spotting
(see Tables 1–3). A Cochrane review of the use of estrogen
to control S/B in progestin-only contraceptive users found a
highly variable result and significant differences between
clinical trials, resulting in difficulty in comparison of the
various estorgenic regimens [13].
Continuous daily COC use results in unscheduled
irregular endometrial bleeding similar to that found with
progestin-only contraception, indicating that daily EE does
not alter the mechanisms responsible for the irregular
bleeding [4,20–22].
A possible reason for the failure of this regimen of
estrogen to reduce the incidence of S/B is the fact that
exogenous estrogen might induce progesterone receptors in
the endometrium. The endometrial site of bleeding in women
using progestin-only contraception was shown to have
increased progesterone receptors A and B [23]. The use of
an antiprogestin has been shown to reduce bleeding in
progestin-only users [24,25]. This finding implicates the
progestin in inducing or secreting some factors that result in
vessel fragility and bleeding.
An alternative theory is that the dose and duration of EE
used in this study were insufficient to control S/B. We did
find a small but statistically significant reduction in the
number of spotting days over the 30 days following initiation
of treatment for EE only (see Table 3).
The use of IBU was not associated with any significant
change in the S/B in these women. A modest effect was seen
in a previous clinical trial [14]. Overall, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents have limited success in reducing the
incidence of S/B in progestin-only contraceptive users
[13,26,27].
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, specificaly IBU,
have been reported to reduce the occurrence of S/B by 30%
compared to PL in the other published prospective study
[14]. We were unable to show any effect on either bleeding
or spotting using the same dose of IBU, 800 mg, taken three
times a day for 5 days compared to PL. This may be due to
the short duration of treatment since many participants exited
the current study within three to four calendar months in
contrast to the 1-year follow-up in the earlier published
report [14].
Our study found no difference between the treatments for
control of bleeding. The total number of observations was
107. This number was adequate for a definitive statement
regarding bleeding (power=0.82, α=.05, effect size=0.11).
Thus, it is apparent that further studies would not be required
to give a more definitive answer unless a much smaller
difference in bleeding was expected. Prestudy calculation of
sample size indicated that we would need at least 50 in each

111

group to achieve a power of 0.80 for a p value of .05,
assuming a moderate effect size. However, we had problems
with compliance from the subjects. Some bled heavily but
never took medication; some did not take the medication
properly, and some never bled. This created a problem with
missing data. To address this problem, we standardized units
of analysis. We compared only the first month's results. We
evaluated the first month that medication was taken (even
though it might be Month 2 or 3 for a particular subject but
Month 1 for another). This gave us 107 evaluable
participants. At the conclusion of data analysis, a power
calculation was done based on the actual means and standard
deviations for this sample. With a power=0.82, the total
sample size ruled out a Type II error. The power analysis
differed from the prestudy sample size because the sample
size calculation was based on estimates. Since power was
adequate, it is unlikely that higher subject enrollment would
have detected differences in bleeding or spotting. It is
possible that the high loss to follow-up could obscure a
change in bleeding patterns spontaneously and not reflect
treatment. However, we do not have sufficient analyzable
data to prove or disprove this hypothesis.
The mean vaginal pH values ranged from 5.8 to 6.5,
higher than what was anticipated for normal women whose
mean vaginal pH is 4.3. The cause of the higher pH levels
could be due to an antiestrogen effect, since the maturation
index was compatible with low estrogen with reduced
number of superficial cells. There was no statistical
difference in the vaginal pH between the treatment groups
for both pH and superficial cell count, suggesting that EE did
not have a significant effect on the progestin-dominated
vaginal epithelium.
The cervical mucus scores were poor, and there was no
difference between treatments. Cervical mucus scores of
b7.0 result in poor PCTs. This was confirmed by our finding
of low numbers of sperm present in the cervical mucus with
only a few motile sperm present in four of the participants. A
poor cervical mucus is one of the contraceptive mechanism
of the LNG SI method [28].

5. Conclusion
Our data do not support an efficacy of either EE 20 mcg
per day for 10 days or IBU 800 mg per day for 5 days as a
method to reduce or stop S/B occurring with LNG SI
contraception. The incidence of S/B should be contrasted
with the high efficiency and need for adherence that is
associated with implantable progestin-only contraceptives.
We believe that directed counseling of the consumer prior
to use of LNG SI is the best method to enhance
compliance with this form of contraception regarding the
occurrence of S/B. For these reasons, it is important to
continue to pursue clinical approaches aimed at reducing
or stopping the S/B associated with LNG SI in order to
enhance compliance.
