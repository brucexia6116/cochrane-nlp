Background and Purpose—Direct thrombin inhibitors, including argatroban, represent an anticoagulant class distinct from
heparins. We investigated the safety of 2 levels of argatroban anticoagulation in acute ischemic stroke.
Methods—This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study included <n>171</n> patients with acute (Յ12
hours from onset) stroke and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of 5 to 22. Patients received
continuous intravenous argatroban (100 ␮g/kg bolus) at 3 ␮g/kg per minute (nϭ59) or 1 ␮g/kg per minute (nϭ58),
respectively, adjusted to target activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) 2.25ϫ and 1.75ϫ baseline or placebo
(nϭ54) for 5 days. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) at 30 days.
Results—Baseline characteristics including neurologic deficits (median NIHSS score 9) were comparable between groups.
Argatroban at mean doses of 2.7 and 1.2 ␮g/kg per minute increased aPTTs significantly (PϽ0.001), with mean aPTTs
at or near target values throughout infusion. Symptomatic ICH was not significantly different between groups (high-dose
argatroban, 5.1%; low-dose argatroban, 3.4%; placebo, 0%; PՆ0.18), with 3 events during argatroban infusion and 2
events Ն7 days after stopping infusion. No significant between-group differences occurred in asymptomatic ICH (7
events), major systemic hemorrhage (no event), or 90-day mortality (13.4% overall).
Conclusions—In this first North American randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of direct thrombin
inhibition in acute ischemic stroke, argatroban at each dose evaluated significantly prolonged aPTTs without increasing
ICH or major bleeding. These results suggest that argatroban provides safe anticoagulation in acute ischemic stroke,
warranting future studies powered to evaluate its efficacy and more precisely estimate event rates. (Stroke. 2004;35:
1677-1682.)

U

rgent routine anticoagulation with heparin, lowmolecular-weight heparins, or heparinoid is not recommended in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).1 These agents increase bleeding complications, eg, intracranial hemorrhage
(ICH), without increasing favorable outcomes except perhaps
in large-artery atherosclerotic stroke.1 Other limitations of
heparins are unpredictable anticoagulant effects, dependence
on adequate antithrombin levels, no inhibition of clot-bound
thrombin, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).2
Direct thrombin inhibitors including argatroban represent an
anticoagulant class distinct from heparins (and thrombolytic
and antiplatelet agents) and have not been prospectively
studied outside Japan for treating AIS.
Argatroban directly inhibits free and clot-bound thrombin
and, hence, thrombin-induced activities, eg, platelet aggrega-

tion and endothelin-1 release.3 Argatroban has predictable
anticoagulant effects,4 does not induce or potentiate HIT,5
causes less bleeding compared with heparin for the same
anticoagulant effect,6 and is well-tolerated in various settings.7–11 Preclinical12–16 and clinical11,17 studies indicate that
argatroban offers benefits in AIS. In rat models, argatroban
increases blood flow to the penumbral area and reduces
infarct size, microthrombi counts, and neurologic deficit.12,13
Researchers postulate that argatroban, by inhibiting thrombin
formed locally in response to ischemia, prevents subsequent
microthrombi formation, improves blood flow to the periischemic areas, and thus rescues at-risk neuronal cells.16 In a
double-blinded, placebo-controlled Japanese study, intravenous argatroban (60 mg/d for 2 days, then 10 mg twice daily
for 5 days) significantly improved global outcome in patients

treated within 48 hours of stroke, without increasing ICH.11
In a casebook review of 2 historical controlled studies, which
included 960 patients, argatroban (mean doses, 1.7 to 2.0
␮g/kg per minute) reduced new stroke and stroke-associated
mortality in HIT, without increasing ICH or major bleeding.17
Among other uses, argatroban is available as an anticoagulant
in Japan for treating large-artery atherosclerotic stroke and in
America for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in HIT
and during percutaneous coronary interventions in patients
with or at risk for HIT.
Few randomized, controlled studies of intravenous anticoagulation in AIS are reported.11,18,19 We report a North
American randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
study to establish safety and explore outcomes of 2 levels of
intravenous argatroban in patients treated within 12 hours of
AIS symptom onset.

Materials and Methods
This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, phase 2, placebocontrolled study of argatroban in ischemic stroke (ARGIS-1) was
conducted between April 2001 and August 2002 at 42 North
American centers. Each center’s institutional review board approved
the study. Subjects gave informed consent.

Patients
Males and nonpregnant females, aged 18 to 85 years, presenting
within 12 hours of AIS symptom onset with a National Institutes of
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 5 to 22 were eligible. Patients
were excluded if they had ICH or nonvascular cause of deficit;
NIHSS level of consciousness score Ն2 or rapidly improving
symptoms; preexisting modified Rankin score (mRS) Ն2; head
computerized tomography (CT) findings of large mass effect with
sulcal effacement in more than one-third of the middle cerebral
artery territory; significant bleeding or coagulopathy currently or
within 3 months; major surgery, trauma, arterial puncture at a
noncompressible site, myocardial infarction, or previous stroke in the
past 6 weeks; lumbar puncture in the past 2 weeks; anticipated
surgery in the next week; mean arterial pressure Ͼ130 mm Hg,
systolic blood pressure Ն220 mm Hg, or hypertension managed by
intravenous medication requiring titration; hepatic dysfunction with
alanine and aspartate transaminase Ͼ3ϫ the upper limit of normal;
drug or alcohol abuse in the previous 6 months; history of brain
tumor; any other serious illness that in the investigator’s opinion
would have increased the risk associated with study participation or
confounded treatment assessment; warfarin treatment with international neormalized ratio (INR) Ͼ1.4; heparin treatment with activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) Ն35 seconds; thrombolysis
in the past week; or need for concomitant use of thrombolytic agents
or intravenous anticoagulants besides argatroban.

Treatment and Assessments
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive high infusiondose argatroban, low infusion-dose argatroban, or placebo for 5 days.
Argatroban was administered intravenously as an initial 100-␮g/kg
bolus over 3 to 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion at 3
␮g/kg per minute (high-dose argatroban group) or 1 ␮g/kg per
minute (low-dose argatroban group), adjusted respectively to target
aPTTs of 2.25ϫ (Ϯ5%) and 1.75ϫ (Ϯ5%) the baseline aPTT.
Placebo was administered as a bolus followed by continuous infusion
of 0.9% saline at volumes appropriate for active treatment given the
patient’s weight. The aPTT was determined 2 hours after initiating
treatment. Personnel blinded to the patient’s clinical status monitored
the patient’s anticoagulant status; adjusted the argatroban infusion
dose (up to 10 ␮g/kg per minute) to achieve and maintain target
aPTTs (not to exceed 80 seconds); and to maintain blinding, with
adjusted placebo infusion similarly, as if titrating for aPTT variations. aPTTs were determined 2 to 4 hours after any dose change and

daily. For aPTTs 80 to 100 seconds, the infusion dose was decreased
50%. For aPTTs Ͼ100 seconds, the infusion was temporarily
discontinued until the aPTT, checked hourly, was Ͻ80 seconds, then
restarted at the lowest dose previously supporting acceptable aPTTs.
Treatment was discontinued if infusion was interrupted for Ն4 hours
consecutively, surgical intervention was required, or intracranial or
major systemic hemorrhage occurred.
Patients received basic stroke care including aspirin 81 to 325 mg
within 48 hours of symptom onset, flat head positioning, oxygen,
intravenous saline, swallowing assessment, and compression stockings or devices, unless contraindicated. Head CT scans were performed at baseline (ie, immediately before randomization), within 12
hours of stopping infusion, and on suspected hemorrhage and read
locally. Stroke subtype20 was assessed at 30 days. Adverse events
were recorded for 30 days.
Randomized patients who received study drug were evaluated for
safety. The primary outcome was symptomatic ICH (ie, parenchymal
hemorrhage, hemorrhagic infarction, or hemorrhagic transformation
detected by CT and associated with neurologic deterioration, defined
as an increase of Ն4 points in total NIHSS score, Ն2 points in
NIHSS motor component, or Ն1 point in NIHSS level of consciousness component) within 30 days. Secondary safety outcomes were
major systemic hemorrhage (ie, bleeding into a major prosthetic
joint; retroperitoneal bleeding; or other major hemorrhage associated
with a hemoglobin decrease Ն2 g/dL and blood transfusion Ն2 U),
asymptomatic ICH (ie, parenchymal hemorrhage, hemorrhagic infarction, or hemorrhagic transformation detected by CT but without
meeting score criteria for symptomatic ICH), and minor systemic
bleeding (ie, bleeding not meeting criteria for major systemic
hemorrhage) within 30 days.
Although the study sample size was insufficient for a statistically
robust efficacy analysis, we explored patient outcomes by group.
Randomized patients without significant protocol or entry criteria
violations who received drug infusion Ն2 days (no gap Ͼ4 hours)
were prespecified as the efficacy population for exploration of
outcomes. Outcomes included the NIHSS, mRS, and Barthel index
(BI) assessed at baseline (NIHSS and mRS only), daily during
treatment (NIHSS only), and at discharge/early withdrawal, 30 days,
and 90 days by personnel blinded to the patient’s treatment assignment and aPTTs. Baseline mRS scores reflected conditions before
the qualifying stroke. Stroke severity scores at 90 days were
dichotomized as “success” (ie, NIHSS score 0 to 1 or 40% improvement over baseline; NIHSS score 0 to 1; mRS score 0 to 2; or BI
score Ն85) or “failure” (including death). Worse possible scores
were given on patient death.

Safety Oversight
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board provided safety
oversight. As support for their oversight, an independent neuroradiologist performed centralized, blinded review of CT scans on
patients who experienced neurologic deterioration or serious adverse
events related to neurologic bleeding and whose complete films were
available (nϭ60). Centralized and local reviews agreed regarding
bleeding, except for 1 patient (low-dose argatroban) with ICH by
local, yet not centralized, review; 1 patient (high-dose argatroban)
with ICH by centralized review and “suggestion of petechial bleeding” by local review; and 3 patients (each active treatment) with
minimal/petechial bleeding by centralized, yet not local, review.

Statistical Methods
One hundred eighty subjects, 60 per group, were planned. In the
primary safety analysis, with 120 subjects administered study drug,
there was a 95% chance of observing a drug-related event with a true
occurrence rate of 2.5%. Regarding comparisons between placebo
and the combined active treatment groups, a difference in event rate
of Ϸ10% could be detected with 80% power using a 2-sided test at
the 0.05 level. Tests of interactions and baseline differences were
2-sided at a 0.10 significance level; other tests were 2-sided at a 0.05
significance level. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Comparisons were made between active treatment groups,

Safety analyses were conducted on the prespecified safety population. Bleeding and adverse event rates were compared between
groups using Fishers exact test. Seven- and 90-day mortality was
summarized by group. Kaplan–Meier estimates of 90-day survival
were compared using the log-rank test.
Exploration of patient outcomes was conducted using the prespecified efficacy population. Logistic regression analyses were
performed on dichotomized outcomes, numerical scores at discharge/early withdrawal and at 90 days, and serial NIHSS scores.
Covariates used in the analyses were demographic or baseline
characteristics that demonstrated between-group differences (0.10
significance level), baseline neurologic scores, and time from symptom onset to treatment.

to achieve aPTTs 2.25ϫ and 1.75ϫ baseline), or placebo
(nϭ54) within 12 hours of AIS symptom onset (Table 1). One
hundred forty (82%) patients completed the study. The
efficacy population included 133 patients.
In the safety population, the groups were similar regarding
demographic and baseline characteristics, except age and
alcohol use (Table 2). Vital signs and routine laboratory
values were similar between groups (data not shown), except
serum glucose (range of group means: 6.4 to 7.8 mmol/L;
Pϭ0.051) and aPTT (26.8 to 28.8 seconds; Pϭ0.032).
Overall, the median NIHSS score was 9. The mean time from
symptom onset to treatment was 9 hours (SD: 2) in each
group. In the efficacy population, INR (range of group
means: 0.99 to 1.04; Pϭ0.08), age, alcohol use, serum
glucose, and aPTT demonstrated significant between-group
differences and were covariates in exploration of patient
outcomes.

remained at or near target values throughout infusion (presented normalized as change from baseline in Figure 1). The
median duration of therapy was 119 hours (range: 4 to 123)
for high-dose argatroban, 106 hours (range: 2 to 121) for
low-dose argatroban, and 120 hours (0.3 to 136) for placebo.

Primary Analyses: Safety
The primary outcome—symptomatic ICH—was not significantly different between patients administered high-dose
argatroban (5.1%), low-dose argatroban (3.4%), or any argatroban (4.3%) versus placebo (0%; PՆ0.18) (Table 3). No
between-group differences occurred by ICH subtype
(PՆ0.50). Of 5 symptomatic ICHs (Table 4), 2 were temporally unrelated to study treatment, occurring Ն7 days after
stopping argatroban (elimination half-life, 39 to 51 minutes).5
2 were in patients supratherapeutic (aPTT Ͼ2.25ϫ (Ϯ5%)
baseline aPTT) on high-dose argatroban, and 1 was in an
elderly patient therapeutic (aPTT Ͻ1.75ϫ (Ϯ5%) baseline
aPTT) on low-dose argatroban.
No major systemic hemorrhage occurred (Table 3). Seven
patients experienced asymptomatic ICH, without betweengroup differences (PՆ0.61). Minor systemic hemorrhage
increased only with high-dose argatroban versus placebo
(27.1% versus 11.1%, Pϭ0.035). Survival estimates at 90

days did not differ between groups (PՆ0.13); 90-day mortality was 13.5% overall.

Exploration of Patient Outcomes
Neurologic assessment scores did not differ between groups
at discharge/early withdrawal (range of group median scores:
NIHSS, 6 to 7.5; mRS, 4; BI, 45 to 55; PՆ0.07) or 90 days
(NIHSS, 1 to 2; mRS, 1 to 2; BI, 100; PՆ0.40). Improvements occurred in each scale over time. No between-group
differences in stroke progression, as reflected by serial
NIHSS scores, were detected (PՆ0.07). Success at 90 days,
by each definition, did not differ between groups (Table 5).
Forty-four (34%) of 129 patients with data achieved NIHSS
scores of 0 to 1. Examination of data suggested differences in
response by stroke subtype; however, sample sizes were
small (nՅ16) and there were no between-group significant
differences.

Discussion
We evaluated safety and explored patient outcomes associated with argatroban anticoagulation at target aPTTs of
1.75ϫ and 2.25ϫ baseline (mean infusion doses of 1.2 and
2.7 ␮g/kg per minute, respectively) versus placebo in 171
patients treated within 12 hours of AIS symptom onset. The

safety of direct thrombin inhibition with argatroban in AIS.
Placebo control was used because the only approved therapy
for AIS is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).1 Despite
eligibility of tPA-disqualified patients, no one received study
drug within 3 hours of symptoms. Patients also received
aspirin. Argatroban and aspirin lack pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic interactions, including no interaction regarding
bleeding times, an index of platelet and vascular function.21
Their combination use during percutaneous coronary interventions (mean argatroban dose: 23 ␮g/kg per minute) has
low (0.9%) bleeding risk.10 The treatment groups were well
matched with the few imbalanced characteristics, eg, age,
serving as covariates in comparative regression analyses.
Group mean aPTTs increased in an argatroban dose-related
fashion, consistent with its predictable pharmacodynamics.4
A study limitation is that despite precautions to maintain
blinding, it was theoretically possible for investigators to
guess treatment identity, because in some cases aPTTs were
recorded on hospital charts.
Results indicate that intravenous argatroban administered
within 12 hours of symptom onset at mean infusion doses of
1.2 and 2.7 ␮g/kg per minute (100-␮g/kg initial bolus) for 5
days provides safe anticoagulation in AIS. Argatroban therapy versus placebo had no significant effect on the primary
outcome of symptomatic ICH at 30 days or the safety
outcomes of asymptomatic ICH, major systemic hemorrhage,
or 90-day mortality. Minor bleeding was less common with
low-dose than high-dose argatroban, perhaps related to a
decreased likelihood of aPTTs Ͼ80 seconds. These safety
data are consistent with the lack of increased ICH or major
bleeding in controlled studies of argatroban therapy in HIT,
including patients with comorbid stroke,8,9 and in acute
stroke.11 The data indirectly contrast with the increased
serious bleeding associated with intravenous heparinoid in
AIS.19
In this study designed primarily to evaluate safety and not
powered to evaluate efficacy, we were unable to detect a
treatment effect on early stroke progression or neurologic
impairment at 90 days. The positive safety profile of argatroban in AIS, taken together with clinical data supporting its
benefits in stroke,11,17 particularly large-artery atherosclerotic
stroke,11 suggest that trials to evaluate its efficacy and more
precisely estimate adverse event rates are warranted. Such
studies could test the hypothesis that early direct thrombin
inhibition prevents extension of primary ischemic areas by
reducing thrombin activity and promoting collateral flow

channels.16 A study evaluating argatroban with tPA in acute
stroke is underway.22
