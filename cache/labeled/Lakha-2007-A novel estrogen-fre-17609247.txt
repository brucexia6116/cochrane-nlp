BACKGROUND: The acceptability and continuation rate of oral contraceptive steroids are limited by unpredictable
bleeding and the fear of long-term risks such as breast cancer. By inhibiting ovulation and by altering the receptivity
of the endometrium, antagonists of progesterone, such as mifepristone, could be developed as estrogen-free novel contraceptives. METHODS: Multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing frequency of amenorrhoea (primary outcome), bleeding patterns, side effects and efﬁcacy in women taking daily 5 mg mifepristone
(n 5 <n>73</n>) or 0.03 mg levonorgestrel (progestogen-only pill; POP, n 5 23) for 24 weeks. RESULTS: More women
were amenorrhoeic while taking mifepristone than POP (49 versus 0% P < 0.001), and fewer women bled or
spotted for >5 days per month (4 versus 39% P < 0.001). Forty-eight percent of women who took mifepristone for
6 months had cystic glandular dilatation of the endometrium but none showed hyperplasia or atypia. There were
no pregnancies in 356 months of exposure in women who used only mifepristone for contraception. Two pregnancies
occurred in women taking mifepristone who were also using condoms for dual protection. CONCULSIONS: Daily
mifepristone (5 mg) is an effective oral contraceptive pill which has a better pattern of menstrual bleeding than an
existing POP (levonorgestrel).
Keywords: antiprogestins; contraception; levonorgestrel; mifepristone; progestogen-only pill

Introduction
Fifty years have passed since the ﬁrst clinical trials in Puerto
Rico demonstrated that a daily pill containing ethinyl estradiol
and norethynodrel was a highly effective contraceptive (Pincus
et al., 1958). Contraceptive development since the introduction
of the pill has been limited to variations on the theme of steroid
hormones [new delivery systems, different progestogens, lower
doses of estrogen (Baird and Glasier, 1999; Population
Reports, 2003)]. Oral contraceptives, containing either progestogen or a combination of estrogen with progestogen, are
popular because they are highly effective and easy to use
(Baird and Glasier, 1999; Population Reports, 2003).
However, continuation rates are often disappointingly low.

2428

The commonest reason for discontinuation of combined oral
contraception (COC) is breakthrough bleeding (Rosenberg
and Waugh, 1998) but fear of breast cancer (Collaborative
Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast Cancer, 1995; Larsson
et al., 1997; Althius et al., 2002), and to a lesser extent
venous thromboembolism, are signiﬁcant disincentives to
both uptake and continuation despite the obvious convenience
of relief of dysmenorrhoea and other symptoms related to
menstruation (ESHRE Capri Workshop Group, 2005).
Progestogen-only pills (POP) have the advantage of fewer
serious risks but are associated with unpredictable vaginal
bleeding which is the commonest reason for discontinuation
(McCann and Potter, 1994; Fraser, 1999). In many surveys,

Daily mifepristone as a contraceptive pill

Materials and Methods
This was a multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled phase II
trial comparing two daily contraceptive pills. The primary outcome
was the percentage of women who had amenorrhoea throughout the
study. Secondary outcomes included number of days of bleeding,
endometrial thickness and histology, and number of pregnancies.
Before starting, the trial was approved by the steering committee of
the Contraceptive Development Network (MRC Grant No.
G9523250). It was performed in accordance with Good Clinical
Practice including regular monitoring of centres.
Between June 2003 and January 2004, a total of 97 healthy volunteers with regular menstrual cycles (21–42 days) aged 18–40 years
were recruited from four sites (34 in Sagamu, Nigeria; 18 in Cape
Town, South Africa; 10 in Hong Kong, People’s Republic of China

and 35 in Edinburgh, Scotland). The study was approved by local
ethical committees at all centres. All women gave written informed
consent before enrolment and were screened before entering the
study by routine physical and gynaecological examination and
measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and pulse rate. Blood
samples were collected for measurement of progesterone, clinical
chemistry and haematology. The size of the uterine cavity and
ovarian follicles were measured by transvaginal ultrasound scan.
Urinary hCG was also measured to exclude pregnancy before entering
the trial. Women who had used any form of hormonal contraception
within the last 3 months of the start of the study were excluded
except in Edinburgh where nine women with regular cycles while
already using a POP were included without having to undergo a
washout period.
Subjects were studied for one pretreatment cycle, six treatment
cycles (24 weeks) and for one post-treatment cycle. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either mifepristone 5 mg/day (one half a
10 mg tablet) (from Laboratoire Exelgyn, 6 rue Christophe Colomb,
75 008-Paris for women in Edinburgh; and from Hualian Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Shanghai, China for women in Shanghai, Cape Town and
Sagamu) or levonorgestrel 0.03 mg/day (POP) (Norgeston; Schering
Health Care Limited, The Brow, Burgess Hill, West Sussex, RH15
9NE) starting on Day 1 or 2 of the cycle. Randomization was achieved
by blocked computer-generated randomization performed individually for each centre to ensure good balance of numbers in the different
treatment groups. Each centre was given numerical sequence of coded
treatment bottles which were identical generated by statistician in
Edinburgh ofﬁce. Participants were enrolled in each centre by the
local investigator. The numerical sequence was determined by the
clinical trials manager in Edinburgh. To maximize, the number of
cycles observed on mifepristone without greatly reducing the power
of the randomized comparison, three times as many subjects were randomized to mifepristone as to levonorgestrel. In Cape Town, Hong
Kong and Edinburgh, daily doses were issued at eight weekly intervals
in pre-packed identical bottles containing mifepristone (a half tablet)
with placebo, or levonorgestrel with one half placebo tablet. In
Nigeria, daily doses were issued at weekly intervals. The placebo
and active tablets were both white but of slightly different size.
Unused medication was returned and new medication dispensed at
this time. All subjects were sexually active and intending to use the
study drug as their sole method of contraception. However, in Cape
Town and Hong Kong some women also used condoms for protection
against sexually transmitted infection. Cycles in which dual protection
was used were omitted when calculating the months of exposure to the
risk of pregnancy.
The women were asked to record every day the amount of vaginal
bleeding and adverse events on a diary card. If bleeding occurred it
was recorded as spotting (one or less pad/tampon required) or bleeding (more than one pad/tampon required).
Subjects attended the clinic for review at eight weekly intervals
during the treatment phase and once more on Day 5–11 of the ﬁrst
menstrual cycle after discontinuation of the study medication. At the
end of the treatment phase a vaginal examination was performed on
all subjects and an endometrial biopsy performed in a subgroup of
volunteers. In order to identify those women who might develop
hyperplasia of the endometrium a biopsy was performed at any time
during the study on all subjects if the measurement of the uterine
cavity was observed to be .12 mm (‘safety biopsy’). Biopsies were
performed as an outpatient procedure with a Pipelle suction curette
(Pipelle de Cornier, Laboratoire C.C.D, 60 rue Pierre Charron,
75 008-Paris-France, Ref. 1103000). Endometrial samples were then
ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin prior to embedding in parafﬁn
wax. Histological examination of the endometrial sections was

fewer than 50% of women continue using oral contraceptives
for .12 months (D’Arcangues et al., 1992).
Even the regular pattern of monthly bleeding characteristic
of the combined pill is considered undesirable by some
women. When oral contraceptives were ﬁrst marketed it was
assumed that women would prefer to have a monthly cycle
because it would be perceived as more ‘natural’ (Pincus
1965). Recently, it has been shown that many women, regardless of age, prefer to have either predictable bleeding less often
than once a month or not to bleed at all (Den Tonkelaar and
Oddens, 1999; Glasier et al., 2003).
Mifepristone is a synthetic C19 steroid which is a potent
antagonist of progesterone (Ulmann, 2000). There is very
little information about the use of mifepristone (or other progesterone receptor modulators) for contraception in spite of
the fact that the original clinical publication 23 years ago
demonstrated its contraceptive as well as abortifacient properties (Herrman et al., 1982; Baird, 2001). The lack of progress
with these compounds has not been due to scientiﬁc reasons
but relates to the political and religious controversy surrounding RU486 (‘the Abortion Pill’). In low daily doses, mifepristone has been shown to inhibit ovulation by suppressing the
pre-ovulatory surge of LH and acting directly on the endometrium to induce amenorrhoea in the majority of women (Ledger
et al., 1992; Croxatto et al., 1993; Cameron et al., 1995; Brown
et al., 2002). We have previously demonstrated in a pilot study
that mifepristone at a dose of 2 or 5 mg/day has contraceptive
potential (Brown et al., 2002). In contrast to pills containing
estrogens and/or progestogens, there is no theoretical risk
that such a pill would increase the risk of breast cancer or cardiovascular disease. Rather, experimental data show that antigestogens are antimitotic in breast cancer cell lines and animal
models and hence might actually reduce the risk of malignancy
(Horowitz, 1992; Klijn et al., 2000; Poole et al., 2006).
A pill which contained no estrogen and which reproducibly
induced amenorrhoea in high proportion of women should
prove popular. In the present study, therefore, we directly compared the pattern of bleeding and other side effects of mifepristone at a dose of 5 mg/day for 24 weeks with a method of
contraception in common use in the UK, the POP (levonorgestrel). We hypothesized that women given mifepristone
would have a much higher incidence of amenorrhoea and
fewer days of menstrual bleeding.

Lakha et al.

Statistical methods
The number of subjects on mifepristone was chosen to give an upper
conﬁdence limit of ,5% for the risk of pregnancy over the 6 months
of treatment if no pregnancies occurred in that group. To maximize,
the number of cycles observed on mifepristone without greatly reducing the power of the randomized comparison, three times as many
subjects were randomized to mifepristone as to levenorgestrel.
These numbers were also sufﬁcient to give over 99% power to show
a signiﬁcant difference in the rate of amenorrhoea over 6 months if
the rate was 50% on mifepristone when compared with the 5% anticipated in the levenorgestrel group (Collaborative Study Group, 1998).
Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 12 (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) and Excel 2003 (Microsoft Corporation). The
two randomized groups were compared by chi-squared test with
Yates’ correction and Mann–Whitney or Student’s t-tests as appropriate tests for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. Analysis of
covariance adjusting for pretreatment values was used to compare the
endometrial thickness in the two groups at follow-up. Conﬁdence
limits were calculated for the incidence efﬁcacy outcomes in the mifepristone group using the Poisson distribution based on person time at
risk.

8POP); 18 in Cape Town (14M, 4POP); 10 in Hong Kong (8M,
2POP)]. One subject randomized to mifepristone withdrew for
personal reasons and discarded the study drugs without taking
any. Therefore, the results of the 96 women who started treatment [73 received mifepristone (M), 23 received levonorgestrel
(POP)] were included for analysis.
Of the 87 women who started the study and did not use hormonal contraception in the previous months, 66 were randomized to mifepristone and 21 to POP. An additional nine women
in Edinburgh who had regular menstrual cycles while taking
POP for contraception were transferred directly to study medication. In this subgroup, seven were randomized to mifepristone and two to POP.
When all centres were combined (Table 1) there were no
statistically signiﬁcant differences in age, weight, height,
BMI or parity between the two treatment groups (two-sample
Student’s t-tests). However, there were some differences in
the characteristics of the women from different centres. The
women in Nigeria were signiﬁcantly older (years 33.9 + 4.2
SD, P ¼ 0.001) than the women in both Cape Town (26.2 +
7,7) and Edinburgh (28.7 + 6.0). The BMI of women in
Hong Kong (19.8 + 1.7 kg/m2) was signiﬁcantly lower than
that of women in Edinburgh (22.9 + 1.9, P , 0.001), Nigeria

conducted blind by an independent pathologist and classiﬁed into ﬁve
categories [proliferative, secretory, inactive, insufﬁcient and cystic
glandular dilatation (CGD) as previously described (Baird et al.,
2003)]. (i) Proliferative includes ‘active’ in which glands are
tubular, with columnar epithelial cells showing nuclear stratiﬁcation
and frequent mitoses (. ¼ 5 per 20 gland proﬁles); and ‘weakly’—
simple tubular glands with columnar epithelial cells showing mild
nuclear stratiﬁcation (2–4 mitoses per 20 gland proﬁles). (ii) Inactive—cuboidal to columnar cells showing focal or diffuse nuclear stratiﬁcation, in glands with simple tubular or undulating proﬁles without
signiﬁcant dilatation. Resembles endometrium of basalis in normal
cycling endometrium. Glands are not atrophic, and show evidence
of limited recent growth or function, but lack the ﬁndings seen in
normal cycling proliferative endometrium. Mitoses are absent or
uncommon (no more than om mitotic ﬁgure per 20 gland proﬁles).
(iii) Inactive with CGD—inactive glandular epithelium as described
above, with dilatation of gland lumina. Dilatation is deﬁned as the
gland having an open lumen that forms a space, i.e. greater than
four times the epithelial thickness. (iv) Secretory—glands are variably
tortuous with cytoplasmic vacuolation that varies according to phase
of cycle. Cells are columnar, with non-stratiﬁed nuclei showing an
absence of mitoses (except for infrequent mitoses in the early
secretory phase). Stromal decidual change starts around spiral
vessels, becoming conﬂuent in the late secretory phase. Some
samples contained inadequate amounts of tissue for accurate histological evaluation.
Ovarian function was assessed by the measurement of progesterone
in venous blood collected at screening and at 8, 16 and 24 weeks after
starting treatment. The woman was classiﬁed as having ovulated at
least once if the concentration was .15 nMol/l in any of the three
samples. Following centrifugation the serum was stored at 2208C
in labelled sample tubes. Analysis by radioimmunoassay was carried
out at the end of the study locally by each centre. Transvaginal ultrasonography was used to assess number and size of follicles or cysts at
screening and after 8, 16 and 24 weeks.

Menstrual bleeding pattern
There were signiﬁcant differences in the pattern of menstrual
bleeding between the groups (Fig. 2). Of the 73 women who
started mifepristone, 36 (49%) were amenorrhoeic for the duration of drug treatment and only three women bled or spotted
on average for ﬁve or more days per month. In contrast, none
of the women in the POP group were amenorrhoeic. Although
the number of days of bleeding was within the range of a
normal menses in the majority (61%), nine women in this
group bled or spotted for ﬁve or more days per month and

Ovarian function
Ovarian function was assessed at baseline, 8, 16 and 24 weeks
after starting treatment by measurement of progesterone in
blood. In 33 of the 97 pretreatment samples, the concentration
of progesterone was .15 nmol/l indicating that in just over a
third of the women the blood was collected in the luteal phase
after ovulation. At each eight-week review, there was evidence
of ovulation in some women in both groups. If a woman
showed evidence of ovulation at any of the three review
visits she was classiﬁed as ovulatory. Ovulation was less
likely to occur in women taking mifepristone (14/73; 19%)
than in those in the POP group although there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference (7/23, 30%; x2 ¼ 0.72; P ¼ 0.40).
However, there were signiﬁcant differences between centres
in the incidence of ovulation and amenorrhoea. For example,
while taking mifepristone only one of the 26 women in
Edinburgh (4%) ovulated when compared with 11/26 women
in Nigeria (42%: x2 ¼ 8.78; P ¼ 0.003). The proportion of
women who ovulated while taking the POP was identical in
the two centres (37%).
Ultrasound examination revealed the presence of numerous
small and medium-sized follicles in the ovaries of women in
both groups throughout treatment. Follicular cysts (diameter

0.014).
Twenty-four women (16M, 8POP) did not complete the full
24 weeks of treatment. Eight women withdrew for personal
reasons unrelated to the study medication (e.g. moved from
the area, relationship ended); six were discontinued by the
investigators because of persistent protocol violations (e.g.
poor compliance, unavailable for follow-up). Two women
withdrew because of anxiety about potential adverse affects
of the pills. Four women in the POP group discontinued
because of persistent irregular bleeding, no women in the mifepristone group discontinued for this reason (P , 0.01). Four
women withdrew because of pregnancy: three in the mifepristone group and one while using levonorgestrel.
Seventy-two women completed the study (57M, 15POP) and
took the medication for at least 24 weeks (168 – 192 days).

four women withdrew from the study prematurely because of
continuous irregular bleeding.
Of the 57 women who took mifepristone for the full 6
months, 25 (44%) were amenorrhoeic and a further 22 (39%)
had bleeding or spotting for a total of 10 days or less
(Table 2). In comparison, of the 15 women who took POP,
none (0%) were amenorrhoeic (compared with mifepristone
x2 ¼ 8.01, P ¼ 0.005).
The pattern of bleeding in those women who continued to
menstruate was irregular and unpredictable in the majority in
both groups. Although episodes of bleeding in the women
who took mifepristone were infrequent and slight, they were
mostly unpredictable, except in Nigeria where 4 of the 15
women who continued to bleed had regular monthly periods.
Nigerian women were more likely to experience bleeding
over the 6 month study duration (13/21; 62%) than those
from other centres [Edinburgh 4/22 (18%); Cape Town 3/9
(33%); Hong Kong 1/6 (17%)]. There was a signiﬁcant difference in bleeding frequency between Nigeria and Edinburgh
(x2 ¼ 6.86; P ¼ 0.009).

using mifepristone and two in the POP group). The cysts were
asymptomatic and resolved spontaneously by the next examination without treatment.

Endometrial biopsies
A total of 39 women had at least one endometrial biopsy. Six
women in the mifepristone group had two biopsies and one
had three biopsies, making a total of 47 biopsies available for
examination. Twenty women (19 in the mifepristone group
and 1 in the POP group) had a ‘safety biopsy’ because the endometrial cavity on ultrasound was .12 mm. A total of 31 biopsies were available from women who had completed 24 weeks
of treatment (27 mifepristone and 4 POP).
CGD was found in the endometrium of 13 of the 27 women
who had a biopsy at 24 weeks on completion of the study. The
remainder were proliferative (4), inactive (3), or insufﬁcient for
histological examination (7). Of the 19 women on mifepristone
who had a ‘safety’ biopsy because the uterine cavity was
dilated above 12 mm, 11 showed CGD on at least one occasion.
CGD also occurred in four of nine women with normal-sized
cavity who volunteered to have an endometrial biopsy at 24
weeks. The endometrium in the sole woman in the POP
group who had a safety biopsy (cavity 13 mm) was too

Contraceptive efﬁcacy
Not all the subjects were at risk of pregnancy for the duration
of the study. Some women separated from their partner, while
a number of women in Cape Town and Hong Kong used barrier
methods as well as the study drug for dual protection. In total,
there were 356 months of exposure in women who took mifepristone as their sole method of contraception and 85 in women
who took POP.
Five women became pregnant during the study: four of them
in the group of women randomized to mifepristone. However,
there were only three pregnancies while the subjects were
taking the study drugs. In the mifepristone group, two pregnancies occurred (both in Capetown) during treatment and were
recognized after 62 and 115 days of treatment, respectively.
Conception occurred in both within the ﬁrst 2 months of treatment. One woman underwent a vacuum aspiration and the
other opted to continue with the pregnancy and delivered at
term of a healthy baby. Both of these women were using
condoms for dual protection. Inclusion of these two women
in the analysis of efﬁcacy gives an estimate of 0.6% (95% conﬁdence limits 0.07 to 2.0%) for the risk of pregnancy per month
while exclusion results in an estimate of 0% (0 and 1.1%). Two
additional pregnancies occurred before starting or several
weeks after stopping mifepristone. One pregnancy occurred
in a woman using levonorgestrel and was only detected because
of a routine pregnancy test 8 weeks after starting treatment.
She had a blighted ovum and the uterus was evacuated surgically. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the pregnancy
rates between the groups although the study was not powered
to detect differences.
Adverse effects
There were no major adverse events in either group. Eight
women (35% of those taking POP) and 19 (36% of those on
mifepristone) reported a range of symptoms none of which
were signiﬁcantly different between the groups including
abdominal discomfort (12% mifepristone versus 4% POP),
irregular bleeding (7% mifepristone versus 9% POP), headache
(8% mifepristone versus 22% POP), ﬂushes (7% mifepristone
versus 0% POP) and mood change (3% mifepristone versus
0% POP).
Discussion

of menstrual bleeding between women taking two types of oral

Endometrial thickness
In the mifepristone group, the width of the cavity and the thickness of the endometrium increased with time relative to the
baseline (Table 3). In contrast, there was no statistically signiﬁcant change in the POP group, and by 16 weeks the difference
in the size of the uterine cavity between the groups was statistically signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.043). There were differences between
the centres in the extent of the increase in size with the thickest
endometrium at 24 weeks occurring in Edinburgh (5.2 +
2.1 mm before starting, increasing to 13.8 + 7.1 at 24 weeks)
(Table 4).

scanty for histological examination. None of the women in
either group showed evidence of hyperplasia or atypia.
Hysteroscopy was performed as an outpatient procedure on
two women (both in Edinburgh) with an enlarged uterine
cavity (29 and 16 mm) detected on routine ultrasound at 16
weeks. The uterine cavity was dilated with mucous ﬂuid and
a pale oedematous looking endometrium which showed CGD
on histological examination (Fig. 3). No serious pathology

contraceptive pills, which contain no estrogen. The results
conﬁrm our previous study, which reported that the majority
of women taking 5 mg mifepristone every day for four
months were amenorrhoeic (Brown et al., 2002). In the
present study, over 80% of women who took mifepristone
were either amenorrhoeic or had episodes of bleeding or spotting ,2 days per month. In comparison, women on levonorgestrel had frequent irregular bleeding (.5 days per month) and
none was amenorrhoeic. Four women discontinued the POP
because the bleeding pattern was unacceptable.
This study has its strengths and weaknesses. The placebo
was similar but not identical to either of the active drugs and
hence the study was not truly double blind. It would have

been possible for the persistent subject and/or researcher to
identify group differences by the size of the treatment tablets.
We think that this is unlikely because each woman was supplied with two identical opaque bottles each containing
8 weeks supply of either placebo or active drug prepared by
a member of the research team not involved with contact
with the subjects. Moreover, the difference in bleeding patterns
(the primary end point) was so striking that we think it unlikely
that unblinding of an individual subject would have had a signiﬁcant impact on the overall results.
Nine women (all in Edinburgh) who were taking POP were
recruited directly to the study without at least 3 months
‘wash-out’. It could be argued that in these women there was

with mifepristone should be perceived as an advantage by
many women (Den Tonkelaar and Oddens, 1999; Glasier
et al., 2003).
It has been argued that prolonged amenorrhoea is unnatural
and even harmful. Monthly menstruation has however been the
norm only for the last 100 years. Prior to that, most women
spent their short lives either pregnant or breastfeeding and
amenorrhoeic. Absence of periods per se does no harm. If
associated with hypo-estrogenism (as in the menopause or
during treatment with analogues of gonadotrophin releasing
hormone) it is associated with increased risk of osteoporosis
and heart disease; if associated with a high dose of progestogen
(as during the use of Depo Provera) or prolonged exposure to
COC (as in extended pill use) it may be associated with
increased risk of breast cancer and heart disease (Collaborative
Study Group, 1998). Amenorrhoea during mifepristone use is
not accompanied by hypo-estrogenism and, as stated earlier
the risk of breast cancer may be reduced (Horowitz, 1992;
Klijn et al., 2000). A recent paper reported that mifepristone
prevented the development of breast cancer in transgenic
mice with null mutation of BRCA1/p53 (Poole et al., 2006).
Concern has been expressed that with prolonged intake of
antiprogestogens the endometrium would undergo hyperplastic
or malignant changes due to continued exposure to unopposed
oestrogen (Murphy et al., 1995). However, studies in monkeys
with mifepristone and other antigestogens have shown evidence of endometrial atrophy rather than hyperplasia (Van
Uem et al., 1989; Ishwad et al., 1993; Neulins et al., 1995;
Chwalisz et al., 2000). In keeping with our previous report,
the endometrial cavity widened progressively with time in
women in Edinburgh, but not in the other centres (Brown
et al., 2002). We have previously reported that much of the
apparent increase in endometrial thickness is associated with
cystic dilation of the endometrial glands and the cavity itself
(Baird et al., 2003). A recent paper reported the results of a
study in which 40 women with ﬁbromyoma were given 5 or
10 mg mifepristone/day for up to 1 year (Eisinger et al.,
2005). Simple hyperplasia of the endometrium without atypia
was seen after 6 months only in a minority of women (28%)
who took 10 mg but none at 5 mg.
In the present study, the commonest histological picture was
of inactive CGD. This CGD was only found in those women
taking mifepristone. The cause of this unusual change is
unknown. It is unlikely to be due to the effects of unopposed
estrogen as it has been demonstrated to occur in women who
have profound suppression of ovarian follicular development
and where oestrogen levels are low (Brown et al., 2002;
Baird et al., 2003). Moreover, it occurs more commonly in
those women taking 10 mg mifepristone per day than in
those taking 5 mg in whom the secretion of ovarian estradiol
is higher (Eisinger et al., 2005).
Novel observations in this study were the hysteroscopy
ﬁnding of atrophic and/or oedematous endometrium. Hysteroscopy revealed that the apparent thickness of the endometrial
cavity as measured on ultrasound reﬂected dilation of the
glands and cavity rather than true hyperplasia of the endometrium. It demonstrates the limitation of using measurements
of endometrial thickness by ultrasound alone as a marker of

a ‘carry over’ effect on the ovary and/or endometrium from the
previous treatment. We think that it is unlikely because all
women had regular menstrual bleeding while on the POP.
Moreover, at recruitment they had evidence of ovarian activity,
i.e. luteal levels of progesterone, follicles .10 mm and/or
endometrium .8 mm. Because they were randomized 2:7
POP:mifepristone, they would not bias the comparison
between the groups. The seven women in this subgroup who
were randomized to mifepristone had amenorrhoea for at
least 3 months after starting, illustrating one of the clinical
uses when the drug becomes available.
There were minor differences between centres in the
response to the drug. However, in all centres the bleeding
pattern was better with mifepristone and the contraceptive efﬁcacy was high.
It is arguably in Africa where there is the greatest unmet
need for contraception. The fact that we show that it is effective
in a range of cultures, including Africa, should help facilitate
its use world wide particularly in those cultures where
women who are menstruating are subject to social taboos.
In the women in the mifepristone group who continued to
bleed there were differences between the centres in the
pattern of menses. Nigerian women were more likely to experience bleeding over the 6 months study and to show biochemical
evidence of ovulation than women in the other centres. For
logistic reasons, our assessment of ovarian function by
measurement of the concentration of progesterone every
8 weeks was imprecise. We classiﬁed a woman as being
‘ovulatory’ if the level of progesterone was in the luteal
phase range on any one of the three occasions when it was
collected. We argued that there would be about a one in
three chance that the progesterone level will be raised in any
single sample collected at random from normal cycling
women as was found in the control cycle. Although the
majority of women in all centres failed to ovulate while
taking mifepristone, there were signiﬁcant differences in the
incidence of anovulation between centres.
These differences between centres are intriguing. We have
previously reported that ovulation and menstruation were
more easily suppressed by mifepristone in Chinese women in
Shanghai than in Caucasians in Edinburgh (Brown et al.,
2002). The daily dose of 5 mg mifepristone was chosen
because it resulted in amenorrhoea in over 90% of women in
Edinburgh. We have previously suggested that these differences in response may be due to differences in diet and/or in
metabolism of steroids. Alternatively, there could be differences in compliance between centres although there was no
evidence from the number of returned pills that the women
in Nigeria omitted more pills than those in other centres. Moreover, a large number of tablets would have to be missed before
sub-therapeutic levels of mifepristone were reached because of
the long half-life of mifepristone (Heikinheimo et al., 2003).
One of the main reasons that women discontinue
hormonal contraception is because of menstrual irregularity
(D’Arcangues et al., 1992) and this was true of women using
the POP in this study. All four women who discontinued the
study speciﬁcally because of menstrual irregularity were
taking POP. The amenorrhoea or scanty bleeding associated

endometrial pathology. The cause of this accumulation of ﬂuid
and its nature is unknown but similar ﬁndings have been
reported in rabbits following treatment with mifepristone
(Chwalisz et al., 2000). It may be that the mechanism, which
normally allows the passage/and or re-absorption of ﬂuid
from the endometrial glands and uterus, is obstructed leading
to an accumulation of ﬂuid within the uterus.
This study has conﬁrmed that mifepristone is potentially a
highly effective contraceptive. Even in Nigeria where there
was biochemical evidence of ovulation in 42% of women
there were no pregnancies in the mifepristone group. In our
previous study, we reported no pregnancies in 50 women
who used mifepristone at a dose of 2 or 5 mg/day for 4
months (Brown et al., 2002). The present study extends our
contraceptive experience to a total of 556 women cycles. The
two pregnancies in women taking mifepristone occurred in
women in South Africa who were also using condoms as protection against sexually transmitted disease including, HIV/
AIDS. It is possible that these women may have omitted to
take their pills every day because they thought that they were
protected from the risk of pregnancy by the use of condoms.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that mifepristone at a daily dose of 5 mg is a safe and potentially effective
contraceptive. The relatively high incidence of amenorrhoea
or reduced amount of scanty bleeding is likely to be better
accepted by women than the irregular unpredictable menstrual
bleeding that occurs in the majority of women taking the POP.
The reduction of menstrual blood loss should convey health
beneﬁts to women particularly in developing countries where
the incidence of anaemia is high. Because of its antagonism
of progesterone the risk of breast cancer may be reduced
rather than increased as is the case with COCs containing
estrogen and progestogens (ESHRE Capri Workshop, 2005).
A large multicentre phase III trial is required further to assess
contraceptive efﬁcacy and safety, particularly with respect to
endometrial cancer.
