ABSTRACT
Vitiligo is a common, idiopathic, acquired, depigmenting disease characterized by loss of normal melanin pigments
in the skin. The most interesting treatment methods for extensive vitiligo involve psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA)
therapy and ultraviolet (UV)-B phototherapy, particularly narrow-band UV-B. In this randomized and comparative
study, we investigated the safety and efﬁcacy of narrow band ultraviolet B as monotherapy and in combination
with topical calcipotriol in the treatment of generalized vitiligo. Of the <n>40</n> vitiligo patients enrolled in the study, 15
were treated with the calcipotriol plus narrow-band UV-B (NBUVB) and 25 with narrow band UV-B alone. The
patients were randomized into two NBUVB treatment groups. The ﬁrst group, consisting of 24 patients (all male),
received only NBUVB treatment; the second group, consisting of 13 patients (all male) applied 0.05% topical
calcipotriol ointments twice daily. Both groups were irradiated with NBUVB (311 nm). In the NBUVB group, the
percentage of the body surface affected was reduced from 27.21 ± 10.41% to 16.25 ± 8.54% after a mean of 30
treatment sessions. The mean repigmentation percentage was 41.6 ± 19.4%. In clinical evaluation (moderate and
marked/complete response was accepted as an effective treatment), 19 patients (19/24; 79.17%) had clinically
good results. In the NBUVB plus calcipotriol group, the percentage of the body surface affected was reduced from
23.35 ± 6.5% to 13.23 ± 7.05% after a mean of 30 treatment sessions. The mean repigmentation percentage was
45.01 ± 19.15%. In clinical evaluation (moderate and marked/complete response was accepted as an effective
treatment), 10 patients (10/13; 76.92%) had clinically good results. Statistically signiﬁcant intragroup reductions
from the baseline percentage of the body surface affected were seen at the endpoint of treatment for the two treatment groups (P < 0.001). However, there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the two treatment
groups at the end of therapy with respect to the reduction of repigmentation rates (P > 0.05). The present study
reconﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of NBUVB phototherapy in vitiligo. It can be a therapeutic option considered in the management of patients with vitiligo. However, addition of topical calcipotriol to NBUVB did not show any advantage.
Key words: calcipotriol, narrow-band UV-B, vitiligo.

INTRODUCTION
Vitiligo is a common, idiopathic, acquired, depigmenting disease characterized by loss of normal melanin
pigments in the skin. The etiology of this disorder is
unknown; however, vitiligo is frequently associated
with autoimmune diseases, and patients also show

an increased incidence of various autoantibodies in
sera, including antibodies reacting to melanocytes
in the skin.1
The efﬁcacy of all the therapeutic approaches
used in the treatment of vitiligo is still a matter of
debate. The most interesting treatment methods
for extensive vitiligo involve phototherapy. Although

Narrow-band UV-B and calcipotriol in vitiligo

psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy has been
recognized as the most prevalent and effective
mode of phototherapy, it is also known to have many
limitations. Narrow-band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) is
gaining popularity after it was reported that the most
effective UV-B wavelength for the treatment of vitiligo
is located near 311 nm.1–4 In the past few years,
some studies have supported this ﬁnding and found
that it is superior to broad-band UV-B therapy and
as effective as the PUVA therapy.5 –7
There have been several reports of hyperpigmentation after the combined use of topical calcipotriol
and phototherapy (PUVA and NBUVB) in psoriatic
patients. Hyperpigmentation developed only around
calcipotriol-treated psoriatic plaques. It was also
reported that the calcipotriol and NBUVB combination
had a synergic effect.8,9 Based of these observations, some studies were carried out demonstrating
repigmentation of vitiliginous lesions with both
topical calcipotriol and with PUVA plus topical
calcipotriol.9–11 Then Dogra and Parsad tried the
combination of calcipotriene and NBUVB in a patient
with vitiligo and had good results.8 More recently,
two studies were performed to determine whether
adding topical calcipotriol to NBUVB phototherapy
enhances the efﬁcacy of treatment.12,13
In this study, the efﬁcacy of NBUVB as monotherapy
and in combination with calcipotriol and NBUVB were
investigated in the treatment of generalized stable
vitiligo.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
This comparative, prospective study included 40
patients with stable vitiligo. It was assured that none
of the patients had any of the following conditions:
hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, thyroid or parathyroid disease, pregnancy, concomitant use of vitamin
D or calcium homeostasis. Patients with involvement
of less than 10% of the body surface area, who had
known hypersensitivity to calcipotriol, and those
who had segmentary vitiligo were excluded from the
study. In each patient, the surface area involved with
vitiligo was estimated according to the rule of nines
before and after treatment. “Stable” refers to the
condition when symptoms have not changed for a
year. All patients were fully examined. Full blood
counts, routine biochemical parameters and serum

total calcium level were performed before treatment
and repeated monthly. The research protocol was
approved by the local ethics committee, and all
patients gave signed informed consent.
Thirty-seven of the patients completed the study.
Twenty-four of them were in the NBUVB group and
13 were in the combination group.
The patients were randomized into two NBUVB
treatment groups. The ﬁrst group consisting of 24
patients (all male) received only NBUVB treatment;
the second group consisting of 13 patients (all male)
applied 0.05% topical calcipotriol ointments twice
daily. Both groups were irradiated with NBUVB
(311 nm), as generated by Philips TL-01 lamps (Philips,
Eindhoven, the Netherlands) in a Daavlin spectra
cabin (Daavlin, Bryan, OH, USA). The total body was
exposed except for the male genitalia and nipples.
Therapy was administered three times per week on
nonconsecutive days. The initial dose of 100 mJ/cm2
was given in all cases. Increments of 50 mJ/cm2 per
treatment were given for the 30 treatments. If the patient
reported moderate erythema and pruritus, irradiation
was held constant or reduced 50 mJ/cm2 until resolution of symptoms. In the NBUVB + Calcipotriol group,
0.05% calcipotriol ointment (Psorcutan Cream,
Shering German Drug and Pharmacy, Istanbul, Turkey)
was applied twice daily, but only after phototherapy.
Treatment was continued for approximately 30
treatment sessions. All vitiliginous areas were carefully monitored and photographed before and after
treatment (Figs 1–3). The outcome was visually scored
as the percentage of repigmentation of the depigmented lesions. Repigmentation was scored as
minimal (0–24%), moderate (25–49%), and marked
to complete (50–100) response depending on the
extent of repigmentation.
SPSS statistical software was used to conduct
the statistical analysis. A one-sample Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test was used to calculate the test distribution. An independent samples test was used to
compare the percentage of the body surface
affected and demographic data differences between
treatment groups at baseline. Paired samples test
was used to compare the percentage of body
surface affected between groups from baseline to
endpoint. Repigmentation rates between the treatment groups were tested by the χ2 test. A statistical
signiﬁcance level of α = 0.05 was used in the analysis.

repigmentation in a qualitative manner. Of course,
this period is not long enough to see complete
repigmentation.
In the NBUVB group, the percentage of the body
surface affected was reduced from 27.21 ± 10.41%
to 16.25 ± 8.54% after a mean of 30 treatment
sessions. The mean repigmentation percentage was
41.6 ± 19.4%. At the end of the treatment, repigmentation rates in 10 patients (41.67%) were marked/
complete response, in nine patients (37.5%) were
moderate response and in ﬁve patients (20.83%)
were minimal response. In clinical evaluation (moderate and marked/complete response was accepted
as an effective treatment), 19 patients (19/24; 79.17%)
had clinically good results.
In the NBUVB plus calcipotriol group, the percentage of the body surface affected was reduced
from 23.35 ± 6.5% to 13.23 ± 7.05% after a mean of
30 treatment sessions. The mean repigmentation
percentage was 45.01 ± 19.15%. At the end of the
treatment, the repigmentation rates in six patients
(46.15%) were marked/complete response, in four
patients (30.77%) were moderate response and in
three patients (23.08%) were minimal response. In
clinical evaluation (moderate and marked/complete
response was accepted as an effective treatment),
10 patients (10/13; 76.92%) had clinically good results.
Statistically signiﬁcant intragroup reductions from
baseline percentage of the body surface affected
were seen at the endpoint of treatment for both
treatment groups (P < 0.001). However, there was
no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the
treatment groups at the end of therapy with respect
to the reduction of repigmentation rates (P > 0.05).
The most common side effect was an itching sensation and erythema, but nearly all the side effects
were transient and tolerable. No new lesions occurred
during the treatment period, and there were no
signiﬁcant changes in laboratory values.

DISCUSSION
Narrow-band UV-B is now the treatment of choice
for patients with moderate to severe vitiligo.2–4,14–18
The use of NBUVB for vitiligo was ﬁrst reported
by Westerhof and Nieuweboer-Krobotova in 1997.
These investigators compared twice-weekly topical
PUVA to twice-weekly NBUVB. After 4 months of

therapy, 67% of patients with NBUVB showed
repigmentation compared with 46% of patients
receiving twice-weekly topical PUVA.19 In another
study by Njoo et al., 53% of children experienced
more than 75% repigmentation following NBUVB
therapy (6% of this group showed complete repigmentation).6 Scherschun et al. reported a retrospective
study of seven patients with vitiligo who were treated
with NBUVB as monotherapy three times a week.
Five of the seven patients achieved more than 75%
repigmentation with a mean of 19 treatments.5 In a
recent study, Yashar et al. reported that 39% of 71
patients with vitiligo treated with NBUVB had experienced signiﬁcant improvement, 22% moderate
improvement, 21% mild improvement, and 10%
minimal or no improvement. The number of treatments
ranged 15–123 treatments, with total cumulative
doses of 7–485 J/cm2.7 Another retrospective, open
study demonstrated that NBUVB therapy was effective in 42% of Asian patients with recalcitrant vitiligo
who achieved more than 50% repigmentation on
lesions.20 Our data also indicate that NBUVB phototherapy is an effective therapeutic option in generalized vitiligo. We had good results, although the
duration was only 10 weeks.
Calcipotriol has been reported to induce repigmentation of vitiligo when used in combination with
sunlight, PUVA or NBUVB.18 It is likely that calcipotriol, a vitamin D analog, may play a role in the Ca2+
regulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors on
melanocytes and/or by the regulation of defective
Ca2+ homeostasis.11 Many types of the cells have
vitamin D receptors, including keratinocytes, melanocytes, ﬁbroblasts and the immune system cells of
the skin. The vitamin D receptor functions as a ligandinduced transcription factor, regulating the rate
of gene expression involved in the control of calcium
homeostasis and bone remodeling, control of hormone
secretion, inhibition of cell growth and induction of
cell differentiation. Calcipotriol is also an immunomodulator that interacts with cells, especially
antigen-presenting cells. The effect of calcipotriol
on melanocytes may be direct or by means of these
immunomodulatory actions.21
There are some conﬂicting reports about the effect
of monotherapy with topical calcipotriol. Parsad et al.
conducted an open study on 18 children with limited
vitiligo, in which they applied topical calcipotriol

341

E. Arca et al.

once a day followed by sunlight exposure; 78% (14
of 18) of the patients responded to the treatment.22
However, Chiaverini et al. reported their experience
on 24 cases of patient with vitiligo treated by topical
calcipotriol monotherapy. At the end of the treatment (mean duration of 3.9 months), 21 patients
(87.5%) had no repigmentation.23 A recent study of
12 patients with vitiligo who were advised to use
topical corticosteroids in the morning and topical
calcipotriene in the evening indicated that 83% of
patients responded to the therapy, with an average
of 95% repigmentation by body surface area, even
in those who were previous topical corticosteroid
failures.24
Various agents, including khellin, oral and topical
phenylalanine, pseudocatalase, and calcium, have
been combined with UV-A to increase their effectiveness in vitiligo treatment, but none have been
found to superior to and safer than PUVA therapy
alone.9
There are some studies suggesting that the efﬁcacy of PUVA can be enhanced when it is used in
combination with topical calcipotriol. Ameen et al.
conducted an open study on 26 patients with vitiligo
affecting 5–40% of their skin. Twenty-two patients
were treated with twice-daily topical calcipotriol
monotherapy and four patients were placed on a
combination treatment with topical calcipotriol and
PUVA. Seventy-seven percent of those treated with
monotherapy showed 30–100% improvement, and
three of the four patients on combination treatment
showed good responses.9 ErmiS et al. conducted a
double blind, placebo controlled study using topical
calcipotriene and twice-weekly PUVA. The authors
concluded that this combination therapy achieved a
faster and more satisfactory repigmentation as
compared to placebo or PUVA alone.11 The other
study of Yalçın et al. reported that the combination
of PUVA and calcipotriol might be effective.25 On the
other hand, there are some studies that disagree
with the above results. Baysal et al. have compared
the effectiveness of PUVA and the combination of
PUVA and topical calcipotriol in the treatment of
vitiligo in 22 patients in a right/left comparative, open
study. The average response rates in lesions with
combination therapy and with only PUVA were
53.3 ± 33.8% and 53.11 ± 30.5%, respectively. They
concluded that additional of calcipotriol to PUVA

342

treatment did not lead to a signiﬁcant increase in the
response rate of the patients of vitiligo.10
After demonstrating the efﬁcacy of NBUVB for
patients with moderate to severe vitiligo, various
agents including vitamin B12 and folic acid,26 topical
pseudocatalase mousse,27 topical tacrolimus,28 and
calcipotriol8,12,13 have been used in combination
with NBUVB in attempts to increase the efﬁcacy and
decrease the duration with results of positive, negative
or no effect.
In a previous case report, the combination therapy
of topical calcipotriene with NBUVB was achieved
higher efﬁcacy than placebo in a patient with vitiligo.8
There are two studies examining the combination of
calcipotriol and NBUVB. A recent bilateral comparison study also reported that NBUVB plus calcipotriene combination resulted in better improvement
than NBUVB alone in nine of 17 patients with
symmetrical vitiligo.12 However, another prospective,
single-blinded, right/left comparison clinical study
of Ada et al. found that NBUVB was effective by
itself in vitiligo and showed that adding topical
calcipotriol does not improve treatment outcome.13
So, while Ada et al. said that adding topical calcipotriol
did not improve the treatment outcome, the other
study reported that the combination therapy was a
therapeutic option that should be considered in the
management of vitiligo.12,13
The duration of our study was not sufﬁcient to
achieve a complete repigmentation but, knowing
that generally repigmentation starts about 15–20
sessions after the initiation of treatment and that if
repigmentation has not started after 30 sessions it is
advisable to change the treatment modality, it was
sufﬁcient to evaluate repigmentation in a qualitative
manner and compare the two treatment groups.
After the 30 sessions of treatment, we ended the
calcipotriol therapy and, in both groups, NBUVB
treatment was continued for the patients who volunteered to continue the therapy.
In conclusion, the present study reconﬁrmed the
efﬁcacy of NBUVB phototherapy in vitiligo. It can be
a therapeutic option considered in the management
of patients with vitiligo. However, addition of topical
calcipotriol to NBUVB did not show any advantage.
Further evaluation of this combination in doubleblinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical
studies should be undertaken.
