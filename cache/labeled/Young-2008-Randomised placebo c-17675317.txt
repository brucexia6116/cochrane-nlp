ABSTRACT
Background: The clinical benefits of domiciliary noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) have not been
established in cystic fibrosis (CF). We studied the effects
of nocturnal NIV on quality of life (QoL), functional and
physiological outcomes in CF subjects with awake
hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide pressure
PaCO2.45 mm Hg).
Methods: In a randomised, placebo controlled, crossover
study, <n>eight</n> subjects with CF, mean (SD) age 37
(8) years, body mass index 21.1 (2.6) kg/m2, forced
expiratory volume in 1 s 35 (8)% predicted and PaCO2 52
(4) mm Hg received 6 weeks of nocturnal (1) air
(placebo), (2) oxygen and (3) NIV. The primary outcome
measures were CF specific QoL, daytime sleepiness and
exertional dyspnoea. Secondary outcome measures were
awake and asleep gas exchange, sleep architecture, lung
function and peak exercise capacity.
Results: Compared with air, NIV improved the chest
symptom score in the CF QoL Questionnaire (mean
difference 10; 95% CI 5 to 16; p = 0.002) and the
transitional dyspnoea index score (mean difference 3.1;
95% CI 1.2–5.0; p = 0.01). It reduced maximum
nocturnal pressure of transcutaneous CO2 (PtcCO2 mean
difference 217 mm Hg; 95% CI 27 to 228 mm Hg;
p = 0.005) and increased exercise performance on the
Modified Shuttle Test (mean difference 83 m; 95% CI 21
to 144 m; p = 0.02). NIV did not improve sleep
architecture, lung function or awake PaCO2.
Conclusion: 6 weeks of nocturnal NIV improves chest
symptoms, exertional dyspnoea, nocturnal hypoventilation
and peak exercise capacity in adult patients with stable
CF with awake hypercapnia. Further studies are required
to determine whether or not NIV can improve survival.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterised by a progressive decline in lung function resulting in impaired
quality of life (QoL).1 Severe lung disease impairs
gas exchange and increases work of breathing
while awake2 and particularly during sleep.3–5
Improvements in nocturnal gas exchange and work
of breathing could translate into better clinical
outcomes and QoL.
Nocturnal non-invasive bi-level positive pressure
ventilation (NIV) is beneficial for stable daytime
hypercapnia due to kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular
disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD).6 Studies utilising NIV in CF have demonstrated improved gas exchange and reduced work of
breathing during a single overnight session,3 4 and
improved oxygenation during physiotherapy.5 7
Uncontrolled non-randomised studies suggest that
NIV may bridge hypercapnic CF patients to lung
transplantation.8–10 Potential complications of NIV
include sleep fragmentation and drying of secretions
72

with decreased sputum clearance. A recent Cochrane
review highlighted the need for randomised controlled trials to assess the clinical effects of NIV in
CF.11
We hypothesised that nocturnal NIV would
improve QoL, functional and physiological outcomes in subjects with stable CF with impaired
nocturnal gas exchange and daytime hypercapnia.
Our aim was to perform a randomised placebo
controlled trial of nocturnal NIV in these ‘‘at risk’’
subjects with CF to assess the effects on QoL, and
functional and physiological outcomes. Some of
the results of these studies have been reported
previously in the form of an abstract.12

METHODS
Subjects
Written informed consent was obtained after
study approval by The Alfred Hospital
Institutional Ethics Committee. Patients were
recruited from a cross sectional study12 of 60
consecutive adult CF outpatients with mild to
severe lung disease (forced expiratory volume in 1 s
(FEV1) ,70% predicted) who attended The Alfred
Hospital CF Service. Inclusion criteria for the
current study were: FEV1 (70% predicted, clinical
stability (no hospitalisation or new antibiotics
2 weeks prior), positive screening overnight oximetry (SpO2 ,90% for >5% of the night), impaired
gas exchange on polysomnography (SpO2 ,90% for
>5% of total sleep time and/or rise in pressure of
transcutaneous CO2 (PtcCO2) >5 mm Hg nonrapid eye movement (NREM) to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep) and awake hypercapnia (PaCO2
.45 mm Hg). Exclusion criteria were: previous
domiciliary oxygen (O2) or NIV, current sedative
use, cardiac or neurological disease and obstructive
sleep apnoea.

Study design
The trial design was randomised placebo controlled
crossover. Each subject received 6 weeks of nocturnal (1) air (placebo), (2) O2 and (3) NIV in
random order separated by a 2 week washout
period. Data were collected at baseline and at the
end of each treatment period (fig 1). Treatments
were commenced, and post-treatment assessments
were carried out during a period of clinical stability
(defined as no current need for hospitalisation or
intravenous antibiotics).

Interventions
NIV (BiPAP Synchrony S/T; Respironics,
Pennsylvania, USA) with humidification (HC 150;
Fisher and Paykel, Laguna Hills, California, USA)
was delivered via nasal or full face mask fitted to

patient comfort. Acclimatisation involved an afternoon session of
several hours with an experienced respiratory therapist and sleep
physician to optimise mask fit and ensure patients could tolerate
therapy. Polysomnography (PSG) was used to titrate NIV settings
thus: inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was increased in
2 cm H2O increments to attenuate any rise in PtcCO2 >5 mm Hg
from NREM to REM sleep, expiratory positive airway pressure
was increased in 1 cm H2O increments to eliminate any
obstructive events, a backup rate was added if the patient failed
to trigger the ventilator. Oxygen therapy was not added to NIV as
the hypothesis being tested was that NIV alone would improve
outcomes.
The 6 weeks of O2 therapy was delivered from an O2
concentrator (Elite; AirSep, New York, USA) via nasal cannulae.
At commencement, therapy was titrated using overnight
oximetry. O2 was increased in 1 l/min increments to maintain
SpO2 .90% for the entire night. The 6 weeks of air (placebo)
was delivered through a disabled O2 concentrator and the flow
rate was increased from 1 to 2 l/min during a sham ‘‘titration’’
session with overnight oximetry. Thus patients remained
blinded as to whether they were receiving O2 or air. NIV and
concentrator hours of usage for the entire treatment period
were recorded.

Primary outcome measures
Validated QoL measures assessed CF specific domains (CF QoL
Questionnaire),13 sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index)14 15 and dyspnoea (Medical Research Council
Dyspnoea Scale, Baseline and Transitional Dyspnoea Index).16 17 A
priori, four domains of the CF QoL were selected (physical

functioning, treatment issues, chest symptoms, emotional
responses) based on our clinical experience of symptoms that
might be expected to improve with nocturnal NIV. The CF
Subjective Sleep Disturbance Questionnaire was developed
inhouse and assessed six subjective symptoms of sleep disturbance. We have previously reported an association between
higher/worse scores and nocturnal hypoxia in the form of an
abstract.12 Subjects were asked ‘‘which treatment was most
comfortable?’’ and ‘‘which treatment would you prefer to
continue?’’ at study end.

Secondary outcome measures
PSG (Compumedics E-series, Abbottsford, Australia) was
manually scored, blinded to the patient’s treatment, using
standard criteria. Spirometry and lung volumes (Profiler and
Elite Series, Medgraphics, Minnesota, USA) meeting American
Thoracic Society criteria, awake supine arterial blood gases
(model 865; Bayer HealthCare, New York, USA) and the
validated Modified Shuttle Test18 were performed.
Neurocognitive testing was performed at the same time of
day after abstinence from caffeine and alcohol. The
Psychomotor Vigilance Task,19 Stroop Color and Word Test,20
Trail Making Test,21 Controlled Oral Word Association Test22
and Digit Span Test23 were undertaken (see online data
supplement for further information regarding subjects, study
design, interventions and outcome measures).

Statistics
Results are presented as mean (SD). Analysis was performed
using SAS V.8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, North Carolina, USA). Data

were analysed as difference from baseline. A repeated measures
analysis of variance or Freidman two way analysis of variance
assessed differences between treatments, with a two sided p
value of 0.05 considered significant. Where a significant
difference was identified, the paired t test or Wilcoxon signed
rank test was used for post hoc analysis, with a p value of 0.017
considered significant to adjust for multiple comparisons.
Assuming an SD of 15 points for the physical function domain
of the CF QoL,24 a sample size of 18 subjects was needed to
demonstrate a 10 point improvement (clinically important
difference)1 in mean score with treatment, with a power of
0.8 and a two sided a of 0.05.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Sixty patients were screened during the cross sectional study
(lung function, overnight oximetry, arterial blood gases) of
whom 14 met the entry criteria for the current study. Nine
patients consented to randomisation. There was one withdrawal because of pneumothorax (while on air) and one patient
did not tolerate NIV as a result of mask discomfort. Data
analysis for the effects of NIV and O2 included the seven and
eight patients, respectively, who completed these treatment
arms (fig 1).
The group (n = 8) mean age was 37 (8) years with a body
mass index (BMI) of 21.1 (2.6) kg/m2 and FEV1 35 (8)%

predicted. There was evidence of gas trapping (residual
volume/total lung capacity ratio 59 (8)%), chronic hypercapnia
(pH 7.39 (0.02), PaCO2 52 (4) mm Hg) and moderate hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) 63 (5) mm Hg).
Compared with patients who were randomised, the five
patients declining participation had similar FEV1 (27 (9)%
predicted), BMI (18.0 (2.9) kg/m2) and PaO2 (60 (5) mm Hg).
However, they were younger (24 (5) years) with a milder degree
of chronic hypercapnia (PaCO2 47 (4) mm Hg) (table 1).

Treatment settings and compliance
Air was delivered at a flow rate of 2 l/min (as per the protocol)
with mean usage 7.2 (2) h/night. Oxygen was delivered at a
flow rate of 1.3 (0.5) l/min with mean usage 6.5 (3) h/night.
Seven of eight patients tolerated NIV (87.5%). Mean IPAP was
12 (1) cm H2O, expiratory positive airway pressure 5
(0.4) cm H2O and backup rate 14 (3) breaths/min. Mean NIV
usage was 4.3 (2.7) h/night.

Quality of Life questionnaires
NIV significantly increased the chest symptom score in the CF
QoL (mean difference 10; 95% CI 5 to 16; p = 0.002) and the
Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) total score (mean difference
3.1; 95% CI 1.2–5.0; p = 0.01) compared with air. Six of seven
patients who tolerated NIV increased their chest symptom score
by >5 points (range 5–20) compared with air, and five patients

increased their TDI by >2 points (range 2–9). There were no
significant changes in these parameters with air or supplemental
O2. There were no changes with any therapeutic manoeuvre in
the other QOL measures (CF Subjective Sleep Disturbance
Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index, Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale)
(table 2).

Comfort, preference
Four patients rated O2 the most comfortable while two rated O2
and air equally comfortable. Only one patient rated NIV as the
most comfortable. Four patients preferred O2 as long term
therapy while three patients preferred NIV. No patients selected
air as their preferred long term therapy.

Polysomnography, arterial blood gases, lung function, exercise
testing
At baseline, sleep efficiency (86 (6)%), sleep latency (20
(23) min) and distribution of sleep stages were normal
(table 3). However, there was significant nocturnal hypoxia
(38 (43)% total sleep time with SpO2 ,90%), hypercapnia
(mean PtcCO2 58 (3) mm Hg, maximum PtcCO2 68
(12) mm Hg), tachypnoea (mean respiratory rate during slow
wave sleep 23 (6) breaths/min) and tachycardia (mean heart
rate 78 (15) beats/min) (table 4).

Air had no significant effect on any PSG parameter, awake
arterial blood gas measurements, lung function or exercise
performance. Similarly, supplemental O2 had no significant
effect on sleep architecture, awake arterial blood gas, lung
function or exercise performance. However, during sleep there
was a trend for supplemental O2 to increase mean SpO2 (mean
difference 4.6%; 95% CI 0.9 to 8.3%; p = 0.03) and cause a rise in
PaCO2 overnight (mean difference 4.1 mm Hg; 95% CI 0.1 to
8 mm Hg; p = 0.07), compared with air. There was no
significant change in PtcCO2 with O2 therapy. NIV had no
significant effect on sleep architecture, awake arterial blood gas
measurements or lung function. NIV increased mean SpO2
(mean difference 3%; 95% CI 0.7 to 6.7%; p = 0.13) by a similar
degree as supplemental O2 but this did not reach statistical
significance. NIV produced a significant reduction in maximum
PtcCO2 (mean difference 217 mm Hg; 95% CI 27 to
228 mm Hg; p = 0.005), attenuated the rise in PtcCO2 from
NREM to REM sleep (mean difference 22.4 mm Hg; 95% CI
20.6 to 24.2 mm Hg; p = 0.017) and trended towards a
reduction in mean nocturnal heart rate (mean difference
26.6 beats/min; 95% CI 0.5 to 12.6 beats/min; p = 0.05)
compared with air. NIV also reduced maximum PtcCO2 (mean
difference 215 mm Hg; 95% CI 24 to 225 mm Hg; p = 0.015),
decreased the rise in PtcCO2 from NREM to REM sleep (mean
difference 23.1 mm Hg; 95% CI 21.2 to 24.9 mm Hg;

p = 0.006) and attenuated the rise in PaCO2 overnight (mean
difference 28 mm Hg; 95% CI 24 to 212 mm Hg; p = 0.003)
compared with O2 (tables 4, 5). Furthermore, NIV produced a
significant increase in shuttle distance (mean difference 83 m;
95% CI 21 to 144 m; p = 0.016) compared with air (table 5). Six
of seven patients who tolerated NIV increased their shuttle
distance by >50 m (range 50–160) compared with air.

Neurocognitive testing
There were no significant changes in neurocognitive function
with any intervention (see online data supplement for further
details).

Adverse effects
There were no significant side effects with air or O2 therapy.
One patient developed a spontaneous pneumothorax while on
air which was considered to be coincidental. Two patients
complained of aerophagia with NIV which resolved with a
reduction in IPAP by 2 cm H2O. There was no significant skin
breakdown related to mask usage. No patients reported any
worsening of mucus plugging or drying of secretions with NIV.

DISCUSSION
This is the first randomised placebo controlled trial of
domiciliary NIV in CF subjects with hypercapnia. The results
of this study indicate that 6 weeks of nocturnal NIV improves
nocturnal hypoventilation, chest symptoms, exertional dyspnoea and peak exercise capacity, compared with placebo.
Our findings are consistent with published NIV data in CF on
several levels. Our NIV tolerance rate of 87.5% (seven out of
eight patients) was similar to the 62–83% seen in medium term
observational NIV studies 25 26 in CF. Our ventilator measured
compliance was 4.3 h per night. Attenuation of the rise in
PtcCO2 with NIV and worsening of PaCO2 with O2 therapy has
been reported in single overnight sessions in CF.3 4 A meaningful
improvement in dyspnoea score was reported in three of eight
subjects during a 2 month trial with NIV.26 We demonstrated
an increase in TDI of 3.1 units with NIV compared with
placebo, which exceeds the minimally important clinical
difference of 1 unit for this test.27 Five of seven subjects (71%)
improved their TDI by a margin of >2 points demonstrating
that the majority of subjects experienced a significant improvement.
We were unable to demonstrate a fall in awake hypercapnia
with NIV, despite a sustained reduction in nocturnal CO2 levels.
Uncontrolled studies of NIV in CF have shown a reduction in
76

daytime PaCO2,25 but results have been conflicting.26 Our results
may be due to a type II error, low levels of IPAP or a short
treatment period with mild baseline hypercapnia. Patients
underwent rigorous in-lab titration of IPAP and checking for
mask leaks. Aerophagia was seen in two patients, indicating
that higher pressures were not likely to be tolerated. Our
protocol duration of 5 months was chosen to maximise
recruitment, minimise dropouts as a result of lung transplantation and decrease baseline fluctuations which can weaken a
crossover study.
This is the first study to demonstrate an improvement in
exercise performance using nocturnal NIV in CF. Compared
with placebo, NIV increased mean shuttle distance by 83 m,
which exceeds the 40 m cut-off representative of a significant
improvement in exercise performance.28 Six of seven subjects
(86%) improved their shuttle distance by >50 m which is
considerable given this is an incremental test. It is important to
note that some of this difference was explained by a fall in
exercise capacity while on placebo, as the absolute increase in
mean shuttle distance from baseline with NIV was 25 m. A
possible explanation is that NIV prevented the deterioration in
exercise capacity seen with placebo. However, this hypothesis
requires further study before any firm conclusions can be
drawn.
Exercise performance with NIV has rarely undergone objective assessment in previous studies. Improvements in dyspnoea
and exercise performance have been observed in COPD with the
application of nocturnal, daytime and exercise NIV.29–31 In CF,
improved muscle strength and oxygenation during chest
physiotherapy has been achieved with the addition of inspiratory pressure support.7 The mechanism is likely to relate to
improved gas exchange due to a reduction in the work of
breathing. In CF patients with severe lung disease, NIV reduces
diaphragmatic work while awake32 33 and improves alveolar
ventilation while asleep.4 We postulate that unloading of the
respiratory muscles overnight leads to the improved exercise
capacity during the day. However, this concept requires further
investigation. We found no improvement in lung function or
nutritional status to account for these improvements. However,
measurement of exercise flow volume loops and inspiratory
capacity could further assess changes in lung mechanics. The
importance of this finding cannot be underestimated as peak
exercise capacity is an independent predictor of survival in both
adults and children with CF.34 35
There was a strong trend towards a fall in mean nocturnal
heart rate with NIV suggesting improved sympathovagal
balance during sleep. A reduction in tachycardia is used

Cystic fibrosis
clinically as a measure of success with NIV during acute
exacerbations of COPD. Whether heart rate could be used as a
marker of nocturnal work of breathing in CF remains untested.
The main strengths of this study were the inclusion of a
placebo arm, random allocation of treatment order, the crossover design and objective assessment of treatment adherence.
The crossover design increased the power of the study and
matched baseline characteristics, which are major difficulties
associated with clinical trials in CF. Nevertheless, the sample
size limits further interpretation of our study and introduces the
possibility of type II errors (ie, erroneously concluding no
difference exists when one really does). In this context, our
positive results are encouraging, given we corrected for multiple
comparisons in statistical analysis to minimise type I errors (ie,
erroneously concluding a difference when none exists). In
addition, there was little more that could be done to increase
recruitment. We are a large adult centre with 250 patients and
we screened a significant proportion of our population. Most
patients who declined participation cited time constraints and
unwillingness to undergo multiple sleep studies and arterial
blood gas measurements. This highlights the difficulty of
powering studies with invasive and time consuming outcome
measures in CF patients with advanced disease. Our study is of
comparable size to published uncontrolled studies of NIV in
CF.9 10 25 26
A potential weakness of the crossover design is a change in
baseline characteristics over the study period due to deteriorating health, exacerbations or carry over effects from treatment.
Ideally, reassessment (eg, QoL questionnaires, lung function
testing) at the start of each treatment period could have been
performed but, as alluded to previously, would have been
extremely onerous for patients already undertaking multiple
investigations. We attempted to address these issues by
ensuring clinical stability at the start and end of each treatment
period and incorporating a 2 week washout period in the study
design. The absence of change in lung function with any
treatment argues against pulmonary exacerbations being the
explanation for the observed differences. However, we cannot
be certain that some of the observed changes were not due to
changes in underlying disease status or carry over effects from
treatment.
In conclusion, we have shown that 6 weeks of nocturnal NIV
can significantly improve nocturnal hypoventilation, chest
symptoms, exertional dyspnoea and peak exercise capacity in
CF subjects with daytime hypercapnia. However, there is a need
for larger multicentre trials to further extend these findings,
clarify which subgroups may benefit most and, in particular,
determine whether NIV can improve survival.
