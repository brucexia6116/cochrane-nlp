AND LEE GOLDMAN, M.D., FOR THE PACEMAKER SELECTION IN THE ELDERLY INVESTIGATORS*

ABSTRACT
Background Standard clinical practice permits the
use of either single-chamber ventricular pacemakers
or dual-chamber pacemakers for most patients who
require cardiac pacing. Ventricular pacemakers are
less expensive, but dual-chamber pacemakers are
believed to be more physiologic. However, it is not
known whether either type of pacemaker results in
superior clinical outcomes.
Methods The Pacemaker Selection in the Elderly
study was a 30-month, single-blind, randomized, controlled comparison of ventricular pacing and dualchamber pacing in <n>407</n> patients 65 years of age or
older in 29 centers. Patients received a dual-chamber
pacemaker that had been randomly programmed to
either ventricular pacing or dual-chamber pacing.
The primary end point was health-related quality of
life as measured by the 36-item Medical Outcomes
Study Short-Form General Health Survey.
Results The average age of the patients was 76
years (range, 65 to 96), and 60 percent were men.
Quality of life improved significantly after pacemaker implantation (PϽ0.001), but there were no differences between the two pacing modes in either the
quality of life or prespecified clinical outcomes (including cardiovascular events or death). However, 53
patients assigned to ventricular pacing (26 percent)
were crossed over to dual-chamber pacing because
of symptoms related to the pacemaker syndrome.
Patients with sinus-node dysfunction, but not those
with atrioventricular block, had moderately better
quality of life and cardiovascular functional status
with dual-chamber pacing than with ventricular pacing. Trends of borderline statistical significance in
clinical end points favoring dual-chamber pacing
were observed in patients with sinus-node dysfunction, but not in those with atrioventricular block.
Conclusions The implantation of a permanent
pacemaker improves health-related quality of life.
The quality-of-life benefits associated with dualchamber pacing as compared with ventricular pacing are observed principally in the subgroup of patients with sinus-node dysfunction. (N Engl J Med

ACEMAKER technology and clinical practice in the United States permit the use of
either single-chamber ventricular pacemakers or dual-chamber pacemakers for patients
who require cardiac pacing. To date, the choice of
cardiac pacemaker has not been based on the results
of clinical trials. Ventricular pacemakers are less expensive, are simpler to implant and monitor, and
have a longer service life than dual-chamber pacemakers. However, dual-chamber systems preserve
atrioventricular synchrony and may be more physiologic.1 Some studies have suggested that as compared with patients with ventricular pacemakers, those
with dual-chamber pacemakers have a better healthrelated quality of life.2,3 However, those small, crossover studies have had inconsistent blinding, have
occasionally used nonstandard means to measure
quality of life, and have been unable to assess whether improvements in the quality of life are maintained
during long-term follow-up. The purpose of the
Pacemaker Selection in the Elderly trial was to assess
the effect of the pacing mode on the long-term
health-related quality of life of elderly patients with
pacemakers.
METHODS
The study was a single-blind, randomized, controlled comparison of ventricular pacing and dual-chamber pacing involving 29
centers. On the basis of statistical-power calculations, 400 patients were required in order to have a power of more than 80
percent to detect a clinically meaningful difference in the quality

of life between treatment groups. Blocked randomization lists
were produced centrally for each site. Patient recruitment began
February 26, 1993, and ended September 30, 1994, when 407
patients had been enrolled. The patients were followed and clinical end points were assessed until the initiation of the close-out
procedure, which began June 1, 1995, and ended August 31,
1995. After the close-out procedure was completed, the patients’
quality of life was assessed by telephone interviews through June
30, 1996. The average follow-up for clinical end points was 550
days (range, 216 to 996).
All patients were 65 years of age or older, were in sinus rhythm,
required a permanent pacemaker for the prevention or treatment
of bradycardia,4 and gave written informed consent for research
participation. Intermedics dual-chamber rate-adaptive pacemakers
(models 294-03, 293-03, 294-03R, and 294-05) were implanted.
Patients were excluded from the study if they could not participate in the quality-of-life assessments, had clinically overt congestive heart failure at the time of implantation, had had atrial fibrillation without any documented sinus mechanism for more than
six months, had serious noncardiac illness, or had inadequate atrial-capture or sensing thresholds.
Implantation and Programming
Once both atrial and ventricular leads had been positioned, a
randomization envelope was opened. The pacemaker was programmed to ventricular or dual-chamber pacing before implantation. Randomization was stratified according to clinical site.
Initial programming in both groups required the use of rate adaptation, which allows a sensor-based increase in the heart rate
proportional to a patient’s activity. Therefore, the formal mode
designations for the study were DDDR (atrial and ventricular
pacing, atrial and ventricular sensing, dual response, rate-adaptive) for dual-chamber pacemakers and VVIR (ventricular pacing,
ventricular sensing, inhibition response, rate-adaptive) for ventricular pacemakers.5 For both groups, a lower rate limit of at least
50 beats per minute was required, and an upper limit of less than
130 beats per minute was suggested. Programming of all other
features was left to the discretion of the investigators.
Patient Monitoring
Follow-up visits and health-status assessments took place 3, 9,
and 18 months after enrollment and at the end of the study. The
assessment of health status before randomization was performed
at the local clinical site, before the pacemaker mode was assigned.
Subsequent assessments were made by telephone from the coordinating center by two experienced telephone interviewers who
were unaware of the patients’ mode assignments. The first interviewer conducted 98 percent of the 3-month interviews, whereas
the second interviewer conducted 98 percent of the 9-month interviews and 99 percent of the 18-month interviews.
Multidimensional health-related quality of life was assessed with
the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health
Survey (SF-36),6 which includes one multi-item scale measuring
eight health-related aspects: physical function, social function,
physical role, emotional role, mental health, energy, pain, and general health perceptions. The score on each of the eight health concepts ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). For example, the average
physical-function score for a healthy 70-year-old person is 69,
whereas the average score for a patient of similar age but with congestive heart failure is 48.7 Disease-specific cardiovascular functional status was measured with the Specific Activity Scale.8 The score
on this four-point scale ranges from 1 (best) to 4 (worst). We validated the SF-36 by comparing subgroups of study patients with
diagnoses known to affect quality of life, such as heart failure or
angina, and those without such diagnoses.
End Points

Statistical Analysis
Base-line characteristics were compared between treatment
groups with use of Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test for continuous
measures and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. We used
Wilcoxon’s signed-rank tests for paired data to assess changes that
occurred after randomization in all patients and changes that occurred after crossover to dual-chamber pacing in patients with
ventricular pacing. All analyses were based on the intention to
treat. Scores for the SF-36 subscales were compared between
modes at each period with a multiple linear regression analysis,
with adjustment for sex, quartile of age, and the base-line score
for the specific subscale. Scores for the Specific Activity Scale were
compared between treatment groups with an ordinal logistic regression adjusted for sex, quartile of age, and base-line score for
the specific patient. In addition, longitudinal mode-related differences were analyzed with generalized estimating equations.10 For
scores for the SF-36 subscales, a repeated-measures linear regression was used. For the scores for the Specific Activity Scale, the
general-estimating-equation analogue of a binomial model was
used. The design of the study necessarily permitted reprogramming from ventricular to dual-chamber pacing if severe pacemaker syndrome developed in patients assigned to ventricular pacing.
In each such patient, scores for the SF-36 and Specific Activity
Scale were assessed before crossover, and these scores were carried
forward for subsequent statistical analyses of quality of life. The
length of time to the occurrence of the clinical end points in each
group was compared visually with use of Kaplan–Meier curves11
and inferentially with use of the Cox proportional-hazards
method12 adjusted for sex and quartile of age. For all analyses, the
P values were two-tailed, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

RESULTS
Base-Line Characteristics

The average age of the patients was 76 (range, 65
to 96), and 60 percent were men. Over 70 percent of
the overall population was in New York Heart Association class I or II. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had a history of supraventricular tachycardia,
including atrial fibrillation, and 27 percent had a history of heart failure. Cerebrovascular disease was
present at base line in 13 percent. The ejection fraction was known in the case of 254 patients (62 percent) and was normal in 56 percent of these. Antiarrhythmic therapy was in use in 17 percent of patients.
There were no significant differences in any of the
base-line characteristics between groups (Table 1).
Indications for and Characteristics of the Pacemakers

The primary end point was health-related quality of life as
measured by the SF-36. In addition, we compared the following
prespecified secondary clinical end points between groups: death

1098 ؒ

from all causes; first nonfatal stroke or death; first hospitalization
for heart failure, first nonfatal stroke, or death; development of
atrial fibrillation; and development of the pacemaker syndrome.
All the components of the composite end points were chosen on
the basis of data in the pacing literature suggesting the potential
for improvement with atrial-based pacing.9 The pacemaker syndrome (which is related to a sustained loss of synchronous atrioventricular contraction) was defined as the presence of left-sided
or right-sided heart failure in association with ventricular pacing
or of symptomatic hypotension with a drop in blood pressure of
20 mm Hg or more during ventricular pacing. We also analyzed
prespecified subgroups of patients with a diagnosis at implantation of sinus-node dysfunction or atrioventricular block.

The indications for the implantation of a permanent pacemaker included atrioventricular block in

During the course of the trial, pacemaker syndrome severe enough to warrant reprogramming
from ventricular to dual-chamber pacing was diagnosed in 53 patients assigned to ventricular pacing
(26 percent), in 45 percent of whom sinus-node
dysfunction was the reason for implantation. Crossover from ventricular to dual-chamber pacing occurred early: 44 percent of the 53 crossovers occurred within one month after implantation, and 77

percent within six months (Fig. 1). Although multiple symptoms were recorded in each patient, the
clinical manifestations were fatigue in all patients,
dyspnea or effort intolerance in 67 percent, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in 24 percent,
presyncope in 33 percent, and a feeling of fullness in
the neck in 20 percent. After crossover, the patients
had improvement in SF-36 scores, including scores
for physical function (ϩ22, P ϭ 0.03) and emotional
role (ϩ27, P ϭ 0.01).
Other Changes in Assigned Mode

Four patients (2 percent) who were initially assigned to dual-chamber pacing had their pacemakers
reprogrammed to single-chamber ventricular pacing
during the course of the study because chronic atrial
fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia developed
(PϽ0.001 for the comparison with the crossover
rate in the ventricular-pacing group).
Validation of SF-36

Patients with a history of heart failure at base line
were compared with those without such a history.
There was a 13-point difference in scores for the physical-function subscale of SF-36 (44 vs. 57, PϽ0.001)
and a 13-point difference in scores for the physicalrole subscale (25 vs. 38, P ϭ 0.004). Patients with a
base-line history of angina were compared with those
without angina. There was a 10-point difference in
scores for the physical-function subscale (47 vs. 57,
P ϭ 0.001) and a 14-point difference in scores for the
physical-role subscale (25 vs. 39, P ϭ 0.002).
Quality of Life

In the overall group, there was significant improvement in health-related quality of life between
base line (before implantation) and three months
after implantation, as measured by several SF-36
subscales (social function, PϽ0.001; physical role,

no significant differences in scores between the ventricular-pacing group and the dual-chamber–pacing
group in any of the SF-36 subscales at 3 months or
18 months. After nine months of follow-up, there
was a significant difference favoring dual-chamber
pacing only in scores for the mental health subscale
(Pϭ0.03) (Table 3). Longitudinal analyses, however, detected a borderline improvement in scores on
the emotional-role subscale in patients assigned to
dual-chamber pacing (Pϭ0.04). There were no significant differences in cardiovascular functional status between groups, as assessed by the Specific
Activity Scale, at either the three-month or the ninemonth assessment. However, there was a significant
difference favoring dual-chamber pacing at the 18month visit (Table 4), and longitudinal analysis demonstrated a significant difference favoring dual-chamber pacing (Pϭ0.045).
Clinical Events

Atrioventricular Block

Among the patients with atrioventricular block at
implantation, there were no significant differences
between groups in any of the SF-36 subscales, in longitudinal analyses of the Specific Activity Scale, or in
any of the prespecified clinical end points (Table 5).
DISCUSSION

There were no significant differences between the
ventricular-pacing group and the dual-chamber–
pacing group in the rates of death from all causes,
stroke or death, stroke or death or hospitalization
for heart failure, and the development of atrial fibrillation (Table 5).
Analysis of Prespecified Subgroups
Sinus-Node Dysfunction

Among the patients who received pacemakers because of sinus-node dysfunction, there were significant differences favoring dual-chamber pacing at
three months in scores on the physical-role subscale
1100 ؒ

(Pϭ0.02), social-function subscale (Pϭ0.03), and
emotional-role subscale (Pϭ0.002) of SF-36. Although in the later assessments there were no significant differences between treatment groups at each
time point, longitudinal analyses demonstrated better scores on the emotional-role subscale (Pϭ0.001)
and social-function subscale (Pϭ0.02) in the patients assigned to dual-chamber pacing. Longitudinal analysis of scores on the Specific Activity Scale
demonstrated a significant difference favoring dualchamber pacing (Pϭ0.02). Furthermore, there were
trends of borderline significance in clinical end points
favoring dual-chamber pacing (Table 5).

Industry sources estimate that nearly 190,000
pacemakers will be implanted in patients in the
United States in 1998, a substantial increase since
1989, when 110,500 devices were implanted.13 Although dual-chamber pacemakers have been in
common use for nearly two decades, the effect of
the type of pacemaker on the long-term healthrelated quality of life of elderly pacemaker recipients
has not been adequately studied.
Over 70 percent of pacemaker recipients are at
least 70 years old,14 and there are sound physiologic
reasons to expect that maintenance of atrioventricular synchrony with a dual-chamber pacemaker might

be desirable in elderly patients.15,16 However, dualchamber pacemakers are more expensive and more
difficult to implant and monitor than single-chamber ventricular pacemakers, and dual-chamber pacemakers carry a risk of complications in two leads,
not just one.17 In the present cohort, pacemaker
placement led to dramatic improvements in healthrelated quality of life. This uncontrolled observation
is consistent with the reported low rate of recurrence
of symptoms after pacemaker implantation.18 However, when patients with ventricular pacing were
compared with patients with dual-chamber pacing,

there were no convincing differences in general
health-related quality of life. Analysis of two prespecified subgroups — patients with sinus-node dysfunction and those with atrioventricular block at
implantation — did reveal a favorable response to
dual-chamber pacing in patients with sinus-node
dysfunction. Nonetheless, these differences are considerably smaller than were previously thought. In

vascular disease, detected differences favoring dualchamber pacing that increased over time and were
significant in longitudinal analyses.
Prior studies have suggested a measurably superior quality of life in patients with dual-chamber pacing, and on the basis of these studies we expected
dual-chamber pacing to have a greater benefit than
we actually found. There are important methodologic differences that may account for our divergent results. Some studies have used a short-term
crossover design19 or measured quality of life with
nonstandard instruments that have not been validated.2 We measured quality of life with a standard
instrument and validated it against known disease
states within the study population. Follow-up in
crossover studies is short, and the long-term effects
of any given pacemaker mode cannot be assessed.
Blinding in crossover studies may be difficult, and
investigator bias may occur. Our use of a long-term,
parallel study design with quality-of-life interviewers
who were unaware of patients’ treatment assignments obviated many of these problems and may account for our unexpected results.
The apparently divergent results of a generic instrument (SF-36) and a cardiovascular disease–specific instrument (the Specific Activity Scale) assessing quality of life in the overall group emphasize the
complexities inherent in measuring this variable in
the elderly. Although it is clear from our results that
dual-chamber pacing is associated with long-term
improvements in cardiovascular function, the importance of aging and of the development of other conditions may overwhelm the moderate improvements
in cardiovascular functional class and minimize the
long-term effect on general quality of life.
The pacemaker syndrome20,21 most often mimics
left-sided or right-sided congestive heart failure with
or without associated left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or it may present with autonomic dysfunction,22 hypotension, and associated symptoms. The
1102 ؒ

syndrome is related to the loss of synchronous atrioventricular conduction. The reported incidence of
the pacemaker syndrome varies widely, from 1.7 percent23 to 83 percent.2 Our results mandate a cautious
interpretation of the crossover statistics. Crossovers
occurred when symptoms of possible pacemaker syndrome reached a clinical threshold for reprogramming to dual-chamber pacing. Consequently, it is
not surprising that we report an intermediate incidence of reprogramming to a dual-chamber mode.
Nevertheless, over 70 percent of patients who were
assigned to ventricular pacing and were alive at the
end of the study were still in their assigned mode.
Thus, on the basis of quality-of-life considerations
alone, many patients who receive dual-chamber pacemakers might fare just as well with ventricular systems. However, more investigative effort should be
focused on finding simple ways in which to identify
preoperatively the minority of patients who will prove
intolerant to ventricular pacing.
The literature on cardiac pacing is replete with
retrospective analyses associating dual-chamber or
atrial pacing with improved clinical outcomes.9,24-26
However, all these retrospective studies are flawed
because pacemaker selection was not random and
because clinicians selected the more expensive forms
of technology for younger, less sick patients. In a
late follow-up of a prospective study of patients with
sinus-node dysfunction, Andersen et al.23 reported
that atrial pacing reduced embolic events, atrial fibrillation, and mortality. We found that there was
no significant mode-related difference in either the
incidence of atrial fibrillation or any of the other
prespecified clinical end points in the overall group.
However, analyses of subgroups of patients with sinus-node dysfunction revealed trends similar to the
findings reported by Andersen et al.23 Patients with
atrioventricular block did not demonstrate any clear
benefit from dual-chamber pacing. This finding in
patients with atrioventricular block is consistent with

the reported failure to find a clear difference in exercise duration in patients with atrioventricular block
with rate-adaptive pacing, ventricular pacing, or dualchamber pacing.27-30
The design of the study did not permit maintenance of an accurate registry to compare the screened
and enrolled populations. However, the demographic
and clinical characteristics of the participants were
very similar to those of recipients of dual-chamber
pacemakers in the Medicare data base.26 Frequent
ventricular pacing might be associated with the development of the pacemaker syndrome.31 However, the
pacemakers used in this trial did not have accurate internal event counters, and the frequency of paced
ventricular events is unknown. The use of rate adaptation may obscure differences between dual-chamber
and ventricular pacing. The importance of this possibility cannot be assessed, since our study did not
include a comparison group with simple ventriculardemand pacing. The difference in clinical events
between groups may have been reduced by the crossover rate. The study was designed with good statistical power to detect clinically relevant differences in
health-related quality of life. However, the statistical
design still permitted a 20 percent likelihood of a false
negative result. Finally, there was only limited statistical power to address differences in clinical events.
In the study, health-related quality of life improved
dramatically after pacemaker implantation; however,
general quality-of-life benefits associated with dualchamber pacing as opposed to ventricular pacing
were detectable only in the subgroup of patients with
sinus-node dysfunction. These benefits were moderate. The interpretation of the quality-of-life results
must be tempered by the rather high crossover rates
from ventricular pacing to dual-chamber pacing and
by strong trends toward clinical benefit in patients assigned to dual-chamber pacing, particularly in those
with sinus-node dysfunction.
