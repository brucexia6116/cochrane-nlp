Abstract
Background: In most states, mental illness costs are an increasing share of Medicaid expenditures.
Specialized depression care managers (CM) have consistently demonstrated improvements in patient
outcomes relative to usual primary care (UC), but are costly and may not be fully utilized in smaller
practices. A generalist care manager (GCM) could manage multiple chronic conditions and be more
accepted and cost-effective than the specialist depression CM. We designed a pilot program to
demonstrate the feasibility of training/deploying GCMs into primary care settings.
Methods: We randomized depressed adult Medicaid patients in 2 primary care practices in Western
North Carolina to a GCM intervention or to UC. GCMs, already providing services in diabetes and asthma
in both study arms, were further trained to provide depression services including self-management,
decision support, use of information systems, and care management. The following data were analyzed:
baseline, 3- and 6-month Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) scores; baseline and 6-month Short Form
(SF) 12 scores; Medicaid claims data; questionnaire on patients' perceptions of treatment; GCM case notes;
physician and office staff time study; and physician and office staff focus group discussions.
Results: <n>Forty-five</n> patients were enrolled, the majority with preexisting depression. Both groups
improved; the GCM group did not demonstrate better clinical and functional outcomes than the UC
group. Patients in the GCM group were more likely to have prescriptions of correct dosing by chart data.
GCMs most often addressed comorbid conditions (36%), then social issues (27%) and appointment
reminders (14%). GCMs recorded an average of 46 interactions per patient in the GCM arm. Focus group
data demonstrated that physicians valued using GCMs. A time study documented that staff required no
more time interacting with GCMs, whereas physicians spent an average of 4 minutes more per week.
Conclusion: GCMs can be trained in care of depression and other chronic illnesses, are acceptable to
practices and patients, and result in physicians prescribing guideline concordant care. GCMs appear to be
a feasible intervention for community medical practices and to warrant a larger scale trial to test their
appropriateness for Medicaid programs nationally.

Background
Given the substantial concern about the broad underdiagnosis and under-management of depression in primary care [1], most primary care treatment intervention
strategies have aimed to improve outcomes through better
detection and by increasing the likelihood of guideline
concordant treatment in the acute phase [2]. These strategies have focused interventions at the system level, in
studies such as the Patient Outcomes Research Team
(PORT) for depression [3], the QuEST project [4], and the
Depression Management Program for high utilizers [5],
and also at the patient level [6-8].
Successful implementation of these strategies leads to
improved outcomes of depressed primary care patients. A
meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of depression
screening [9] demonstrated that overall, screening and
physician feedback reduced the risk for persistent depression (summary relative risk, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95]).
Feedback alone is of questionable benefit; improvement
in outcome is strongest in clinic systems in which screening and feedback are combined with system changes that
help ensure adequate treatment and follow-up. These
results led the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to recommend screening adults for depression only in clinical
practices that have systems in place to ensure accurate
diagnosis, effective treatment, and coordinated follow-up
[9].
These three elements – accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and coordinated follow-up – are the core features of
depression care management, a strategy in which a trained
individual enhances the delivery of clinical services by
assisting the physician with the identification, treatment,
and closely monitored follow-up of primary care patients
with depression. Such enhancement can help the primary
care physician better address the competing clinical
demands inherent in routine practice (e.g., acute vs.
chronic illness care) [10]. Care managers who specialize
only in depression have consistently shown improvements in patient outcomes relative to usual primary care
in randomized controlled trials. Hunkeler reported a benefit of 57% response vs. 38% response at 6 months (p =
0.003)[11]. Use of such specialist care managers in collaborative care studies has resulted in improvements in
remission at 6 months (44% vs. 31%, p = 0.05)[12] and
treatment response at 4 months (70.4% vs. 42.3%, p =
0.04)[6]. Katzelnick demonstrated that use of these managers produced a greater proportion of patients in remission at 12 months (45.3% vs. 27.7%, p < 0.001) for a
group of high utilizers [5]. Simon reported that specialist
care management decreased the odds of persistent major
depression at 6 months by more than half (OR = 0.45,
95%CI 0.24–0.86)[13]. Wells showed a greater proportion of responders at 6 months (64.4% vs. 54.4%, p =

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/8/7

0.005)[14]. In an older population using a depression
specialist, Unutzer reported a greater proportion of
responders at 12 months (45% vs. 19%, odds ratio 3.45,
p < 0.001)[15]. In a rural population, Rost and colleagues
demonstrated a greater reduction severity for depressed
patients just beginning treatment (a decrease of 8.2 points
more than usual care on a modified CES-D scale, 95% CI
0.2–16.1)[4]. Gensichen recently completed a meta-analysis of 13 studies and concluded that case management
services improved the management of major depression
in primary health care settings ; patients were more likely
to achieve remission after 6–12 months (relative risk 1.39,
95% CI 1.30–1.48)[16]. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for specialist care managers ranged form
$9,592 to $14,306 per quality-adjusted life-year [17].
Specialist care managers have varying responsibilities,
which generally include many components–symptom
assessment, medication support for the patient, monitoring to improve follow-up, communication with the primary care physician, patient education with selfmanagement skills, decision support for the clinician, and
the use of an information system. Despite the effectiveness of specialist care management, financial cost can be a
major barrier to its implementation [18-22]. However, by
managing multiple chronic conditions within primary
care practices, a generalist care manager (GCM) may be
both more accepted by the practices and more cost-effective than the specialist manager.
The North Carolina (NC) Division of Medical Assistance
has been the leader among a handful of state Medicaid
programs that have deployed expanded Primary Care
Case Management (PCCM) models [23] for asthma and
diabetes. These efforts have improved access to primary
care services while reducing inpatient hospital services
and emergency room costs [24]. Extension of these models to patients with depression could lead to improved
care and lower costs for Medicaid programs, for two reasons. First, given the frequent comorbidity of diabetes and
asthma with depression in primary care, GCMs who are
able to manage all three conditions would be especially
useful and efficient in a primary care setting. The prevalence of depressive illness appears to be at least twice as
high among patients with diabetes [25] or severe asthma
[26] as among control primary care groups, and diabetes
complications [27] and worse asthma outcomes [28,29]
are associated with depressive illness. Second, GCMs may
be more readily incorporated into primary care practices
than are specialist care managers, especially in small or
rural practices, which might not have the critical mass of
patients to support a specialist care manager.
In this context, GCMs can offer the same services to
patients and physicians as their specialist care manager

counterparts, but they can cover additional chronic conditions including asthma, diabetes, and/or depression. Such
a role for a GCM for depressed patients has not been
described previously. Because of the existence of care
management for asthma and diabetes in NC and because
of NC's leadership in PCCM, NC is an ideal setting in
which to test the feasibility of applying GCM in this way.
We designed a pilot program, PrimeCare, to demonstrate
the feasibility of training GCMs and deploying them into
primary care settings statewide.

We excluded from the study patients with bipolar disorder
(as indicated by chart; patient self-report; positive
response to either of the first two Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) [33] questions for current or past
manic episode; or history of Lithium use), psychotic
symptoms (as indicated by chart; self-report; positive
responses to the first SCID[33] question for persecutory
delusions, auditory hallucinations, and visual hallucinations; or history of antipsychotic use), or active suicidal
ideation requiring psychiatric admission (identified by
PHQ-9 with further assessment as needed).

Methods
With a sample of Medicaid managed care patients, we
piloted a randomized clinical trial comparing the benefits
of a generalist care manager (GCM) for asthma, diabetes,
and depression versus usual care (UC), in which care
management was provided only for diabetes and asthma.
Population and sample
Patients with depression were recruited from two primary
care clinics in western North Carolina, the Mountain Area
Health Education Center (MAHEC) in Buncombe County
and the Hot Springs Health Program in adjacent Madison
County. Buncombe County has an estimated population
of 218,876, with 90% White and 7% Black. Four percent
of the population is of Hispanic or Latino origin. Buncombe County is a mixed urban-rural area with 314.5 persons per square mile. The 1999 per capita income was
$20,384, slightly higher than the state's per capita income
of $20,307. Madison County has an estimated population
of 20,256, with 98% White and 1% Black. Two percent of
the population is of Hispanic or Latino origin. Madison
County is a predominantly rural area with 43.7 persons
per square mile. The 1999 per capita income was $16,076
[30]. MAHEC has 9 part-time attending physicians, 24 residents, and 1600 adult Medicaid patients; the Hot Springs
program has 3 participating primary care physicians and
800 adult Medicaid patients.

We screened all adult Medicaid patients who visited the
offices for medical services at the two primary care sites
from July 2003 until February 2005 to identify those who
were significantly depressed. We used the 9-item depression component of the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-9) as the screening tool [31]. We provided screening feedback to physicians on all patients; for those who
scored 10 or greater on this scale [32], the primary care
physician verified the presence of major depression by
clinical exam and determined previous histories of
depression, experience with antidepressant medication
and counseling services, and current wishes for treatment.
Patients meeting selection criteria who were willing to
begin or continue antidepressant medication were eligible
for the pilot study.

Consistent with other care management trials, [6,11-13]
patients, rather than clinics, were randomized to the intervention, and randomization was stratified by clinic and
by whether the patient was beginning or continuing antidepressant medication. Specifically, for each of the two
sites, a list of 200 study ID numbers was generated, each
with a random assignment to the treatment or control
condition. Each random assignment was placed into a
sealed envelope labeled with the corresponding ID
number. The 120 lowest-numbered envelopes were
reserved for patients with newly diagnosed depression,
and the 80 highest-numbered envelopes were reserved in
a separate box for patients already treated with antidepressant medication. Oncea patient was enrolled in the study,
the care manager selected the appropriate box and opened
the first envelope to determine the patient's treatment
assignment. Randomization was done in blocks of four
consecutive ID numbers so that allocation to the two conditions would be balanced over time.
All risks and benefits associated with PrimeCare participation were explained to participants, who provided written
informed consent prior to study enrollment. The institutional review board at the University of North Carolina
approved and monitored the protocol.
Intervention
The intervention consisted of GCM-provided care management for depression through: (1) monitoring of adherence to treatment guidelines and the presence of
medication side effects, (2) routine follow-up by telephone or in-person visit every 2 weeks during the acute
phase of treatment and every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase, (3) use of a case registry to monitor the
course of illness and process of care, (4) patient education
about depression and instruction in self-management
skills and goals, (5) bi-weekly telephone supervision of
the GCM (30 minutes) by the study psychiatrist and (6)
coordination with the primary care physician and consultation with a psychiatrist as needed. Follow-up and PHQ9 administration followed the schedule shown in Figure
1. This follow-up regimen was patterned after those uti-

lized in published clinical trials and general recommendations [1,3,14].
GCMs who were already trained in care management
skills for diabetes care and asthma care, received additional training in depression care management based on
the training manual for depression specialists used in the
IMPACT clinical trial of late-life depression in primary
care [34]. The three GCMs were college graduates with
specialization in mental health fields and had at least 5
years of care management experience before joining the
Medicaid program.
Patients in the Usual Care (UC) group, whose physicians
knew of their diagnosis and their placement in this UC
group, received treatment and referral to mental health
professionals as was consistent with the physicians' usual
practices. These patients did not have access to the GCM
for depression care, but patients already receiving diabetes
and/or asthma care management continued to receive it.
This design allowed us to assess whatever incremental
benefit might be provided by the addition of depression
care management.
A total of 45 patients were enrolled in the pilot program
from July 2003 through February 2005, of whom 36 were
followed up at 3 months and 34 followed up at 6 months.

Measures
Standard demographic measures, including gender, ethnicity, marital status, education level, housing type, and
age were collected from patients by the enrollment coordinator through self-report.

PHQ9: The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) functioned as both a screen and a severity measure [35] and
was administered at least 3 times (at baseline, 3 months,
and 6 months) by physicians seeing the patients and/or
by a research assistant blinded to the study arm of the
patient. A cut point of 10 was used to detect moderate
depression.
Hamilton Depression Index: The Ham-D is a well
accepted research tool for measuring the severity of
depression and response to treatment [36,37] and was
collected by the enrollment coordinator at baseline and
then by a research assistant blinded to the study arm of the
patient at 3 and 6 months. A cut point of 14 was used to
identify moderate depression.
Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 : The SF-12 is a
commonly used measure of functional status and is
divided into two scores, the mental Component Summary
(MCS-12) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS12). The MCS-12 and PCS-12 are scored based on 1998

US population norms, with a mean of 50 and a standard
deviation of 10 [38]. The SF-12 was administered at baseline by the enrollment coordinator and at 6 months by the
research assistant.

Patient outcomes
Baseline measures included standard sociodemographic
variables, the PHQ-9 score, the Ham-D score, the SF-12
score, and current use of antidepressant medication.

Physical comorbidity was measured by counting the
number of 14 chronic physical conditions the subject
reported at baseline, and was coded as two or more, one,
or zero comorbidities [11].

Patient outcomes at 3 and 6 months included % of
patients with a ≥ 50% decrease in depressive severity (as
measured by the PHQ-9 and Ham-D), % of patients with
remission of depressive episode (as measured by PHQ-9
and Ham-D); adequacy of current dose and duration of
treatment according to depression guidelines [39,40] ;
changes in the SF-12 scores; and patients' perceptions of
treatment. Utilization rates for medical and mental health
services during the 12 weeks after enrollment were compared using t-tests.

Medication dosage was measured in three ways: chart
abstraction was used to measure prescriptions documented by physicians, Medicaid claims data were used to
measure prescriptions filled, and patient self-reports were
used to measure medications taken. Medicaid data were
available for all patients; chart and self-report data were
96% and 80% complete respectively.
Patients' perceptions of depression management were
assessed by asking patients to rate on a 5-point scale from
"strongly disagree" to "strongly agree" six items that were
designed for this study: "(1) I understand that depression
is a medical illness and treatment can make it better. (2) I
can do things on my own that will help me better manage
my depression. (3) I am comfortable with my doctor treating my depression with medications. (4) I understand the
possible side effects that I might experience with the medicine for my depression. (5) The quality of care I have
received for depression at this clinic has been good. (6)My
care was explained to me in a way that I could understand." These data were collected by a research assistant
blinded to the patient's treatment arm.
Components of GCM care: GCM case notes were
abstracted by one of the authors (SL) to determine the
nature and intensity of interactions with patients.
Value of GCMs for clinicians and staff: Four focus groups
were held with 12 physicians and 9 clinical staff at the two
sites (two groups of physicians and two groups of staff) to
discuss integration of GCM into the primary care setting
and perceived benefits and challenges
Time Study: We administered written questionnaires to
personnel who participated in the study in order to measure average time spent interacting with the care manager
before, during, and after the study period. The value of
that time was calculated based on total compensation
(wages+benefits).
Utilization data: Medicaid claims data were used to measure utilization of mental health and primary care services
during the 12 weeks after study enrollment.

Data analysis
For the primary outcome variable, response status (PHQ9 scores, Ham-D scores, SF-12 scores), we performed ttests between GCM and UC in change from 0–3 months
and change from 0–6 months. Chi-square tests were used
to test the difference between GCM and UC in sociodemographic variables and proportion of patients using minimally adequate medication dose and proportion using
moderately adequate medication dose and proportion
using moderately adequate medication dose for at least
75% of each time period. For the evaluation of a pilot
study, we set the alpha level at .15.

GCM notes and focus group comments were grouped and
coded thematically. Predominant themes common across
both clinic sites and types of interviewees (i.e., physicians
and clinical support staff) and cited by all or most of the
respondents are described as key, primary findings.
Responses cited less often or responses that were not
described by both types of informants or sites are listed as
secondary findings. Responses offered by a single individual or small minority are not listed.

Results
The study participants had a median age of 40.0 years and
nearly all were female (95.6%); 31.8% were married or
cohabiting. They were primarily White (62.2%), although
24.4% were Black and 13.3% had another race or ethnicity (mainly Hispanic or Russian/Ukrainian). Forty-five
percent had less than a high school diploma and 54.6%
lived in mobile homes. At baseline the median PHQ-9
score was 16.50 and median Ham-D score was 20.1(Table
1). In terms of clinical characteristics, nearly three fifths of
the participants had previously been diagnosed with
depression and three quarters had a serious pulmonary
condition, diabetes, or hypertension. Other self-reported
comorbid physical conditions were fairly common
among this sample, and fully 84% of participants
reported experiencing chronic pain. At baseline, the SF-12

means were about 1 SD below the population mean on
mental health and 2 SD below the population mean on
physical health. Compared to the general population of
patients with depression, these statistics describe a relatively sick group with low socioeconomic status.
The treatment and control groups were similar with
respect to sociodemographic characteristics (Table 1). The
GCM group as compared to UC group reported a slightly
higher average number of self-reported comorbid chronic
medical conditions and a higher proportion of neurological and urinary tract conditions.
Clinical outcomes
Both study arms demonstrated progressive improvement
in depression scores at 3 month and 6 month follow-up
(Table 2). However, clinical outcomes of depression and
functional status showed no significant differences
between GCM and UC in change from 0–3 months or
change from 0–6 months, except that UC improved more
than GCM on the MCS-12 (Short Form 12 Mental Component Summary) from baseline to three months (p = .09;
Table 2). Both arms improved substantially on physical
health from baseline to 6 months (UC p = .003, GCM p =
.04).

The GCM proportion of patients using minimal/moderate
adequate dose for at least 75% of each time period was
greater for 10/12 individual variables (Table 3). Three of
these tests (one for chart data and two for Medicaid data)
had p < .15.
Patients' perceptions
Patients' perceptions of the care they received demonstrated slightly higher means (i.e., more positive
responses) at 6 months than at 3 months, and were close
to the scale point representing "Agree." For the items
measuring patient perception of depression management,
the lowest mean was for "there are things I can do myself"
and the highest was for "care explained in a way I could
understand." Patients agreed with most of the statements
at both time points, and with respect to feeling that they
had control in managing their depression, patients gave a
neutral response at 3 months but moved closer to agreement by the 6 month point. At alpha = .15 there are no
differences between patients with a history of depression
and those with newly diagnosed depression. There are
only two significant differences between GCM and UC: At
3 months the GCM patients had a higher mean on understanding side effects (3.5 > 3.1, p = .12) and at 6 months
the GCM patients had a lower mean on quality of care
(3.2 < 3.7, p = .10).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2296/8/7

Components of GCM Care
Record abstraction for the 19 GCM patients with 6 month
follow up data documented that most of the interactions
represented phone calls (40%), attempted phone calls
(17%), or direct patient contact (15%). Aside from
depression, comorbid conditions were the most common
issues addressed (36%), then social issues (27%) and
appointment reminders (14%). Only nine percent of
GCM activities focused on adherence to depression meds
and 10% on depression med side effects; 12% included a
PHQ9 evaluation. A comparison of medians indicated
that from baseline to the 6 month point, those with at
least one chronic condition reported to the GCM other
than depression (N = 11) had more contacts in person, by
phone, and indirectly (i.e., with someone other than the
patient). These increased numbers of contacts were
focused more often on core issues of depression and
chronic conditions than on social issues. For the 19
patients the GCMs recorded 873 service episodes, an average of 46 episodes per patient; and 59% involved one of
the 11 patients with chronic conditions. Services for these
patients were slightly more likely to be initiated by someone other than the care manager (5% vs. 1%), have side
effects mentioned in the record (13% vs. 6%), or have
PHQ9 mentioned (14% vs. 10%). Services for patients
with these chronic conditions were less likely to have
social issues mentioned in the record (21% vs. 34%). For
patients with these chronic conditions, a slightly smaller
proportion of services involved phone contact or
attempted phone contact (53% vs. 61%) and more
involved clinic or office visits (16% vs. 10%). Fewer of the
contacts were with community agencies (0% vs. 8%) and
more were with the patient or primary care provider (75%
vs. 66%).
Value of GCM for Clinicians
Focus group participants found the following GCM activities to be the most valuable: monitoring/tracking side
effects of psychotropic medications, following up in initial weeks after diagnosis, scheduling/facilitating follow
up appointments, making arrangements as needed to
insure appointments were kept, and supporting clinical
care teams as an extension of the staff. Items cited as having some value included being a supportive listener for
patients, providing in-service training for nursing staff
addressing social/human service issues, providing focused
behavioral therapy, conducting home visits, and attending physician visits with the patients.

Focus group participants identified challenges to the utilization of GCMs. These included the need to have more
information about the GCM's work with patients (preferably in the chart instead of through hallway conversations). They indicated that information should be succinct
and easily accessible (e.g., in a standardized, checklist

fashion). They requested that the GCM be on-site during
all clinical hours and with sufficient capacity to respond
during patient appointments. Physicians cited that separate reimbursement for follow up care from a payor such
as Medicaid, and/or performance-based pay, may incentivize use of GCMs in a practice.
Time Study
A total of 18 physicians and 9 staff completed the survey.
Staff did not require more time to interact with GCMs,
whereas physicians spent an average of 4 minutes more
per week interacting with GCMs for depression care, as
compared with the period after the study. The total impact
of the time cost on physicians and other clinic staff is
equal to 11% of the total GCM annual salary and benefits.

Utilization Data
Based on Medicaid claims data, no difference existed
between GCM and UC groups on visits to mental health
specialists and primary care physicians for the 12 weeks
after enrollment in the study. The means for mental
health, primary care, and total visits respectively were 0.5,
3.1, and 3.7 for the GCM arm, and 0.7, 3.1, and 3.8 for the
UC arm.

Discussion
This pilot study was the first to start with a chronic disease
care manager, already present in primary care and assisting in the management of asthma and diabetes, and provide further training and supervision in the management
of depression. Our experience demonstrates that training

and deployment of GCMs into primary care practices is
feasible and provides some guidance for further development and testing of this management strategy

(low score on "there are things I can do myself") present
substantial impediments for GCMs and physicians to
overcome.

In this small pilot study, we did not see relative benefits
for the GCM arm for the primary clinical outcomes. We
found similar improvement in both treatment arms for
depression and functional status outcomes, except for a
greater improvement in general mental health status for
the UC group. The clinical meaning of this one difference
is unclear. Possible explanations for the general lack of
differences include insufficient statistical power (due to
the small sample size), patient non-adherence with the
more aggressive treatment recommendations in the GCM
arm, and a high quality of usual care making the benefit
of the GCM arm harder to identify. Clinicians were aware
of the study and had patients in both arms of the protocol;
it is certainly possible that for patients enrolled in UC, the
providers were more vigilant than usual in monitoring
depression care themselves, thus diminishing the difference between the two study arms.

Secondary outcomes, reflected by intermediate measures
such as dosing of medications, were suggestive of benefit
from use of GCMs. The results from a large number of
tests, taken together, suggest that GCMs as compared to
UC resulted in more written prescriptions of adequate
medication dosages. Chi-square results were in this direction more often than would be expected by chance. This is
more evident in the chart data than in the Medicaid and
self-report data. This may indicate that GCMs influenced
prescription writing by physicians more than they were
able to influence prescription filling or medication use by
patients.

Another possibility is that GCM care for asthma and diabetes affected depressive symptoms. Seven (one third) of
the patients in the UC group were receiving such services;
the GCMs' presence in the lives of these patients may have
been enough to improve their depressive symptoms or the
GCMs may have encouraged these patients to follow the
UC physicians' advice for depression, thus diluting the
difference between the two study arms. Furthermore,
poorly controlled asthma and diabetes can present with
symptoms similar to depression such as fatigue, difficulty
concentrating, and sleep disturbances. Care management
that results in better asthma and diabetes control may
improve these depressive symptoms. In addition, care
managers working with asthmatic and diabetic patients
focus on patients' knowledge of and correct use of glucometers and peak flow meters, and on the accurate recording of results. These patients may be more engaged in their
medical and depression care than are patients without
those medical illnesses. It seems possible that care management services for medical conditions could have
improved depression outcomes in the UC group.
On the other hand, eleven (50%) of the GCM group were
receiving care management services for asthma and/or
diabetes, and the GCM group appeared to have more selfreported comorbid illnesses than the UC group; the care
managers may have limited their time devoted to depression care management to focus on these patients' other illnesses. Data from the GCM case records support this
assertion. In addition, the overall poor physical health of
this Medicaid population (2 standard deviations below
the norm for physical functioning-Table 2), the high rate
of chronic pain (84%) reported, and the low self-efficacy

Patient knowledge, attitudes, and satisfaction appear to
have improved between the 3 month and 6 month follow-up points in both arms. It is not surprising that GCM
patients with regular contact and education about these
items had a better understanding of side effects than did
UC patients at 3 months. However, the UC patients seem
to have caught up by 6 months, perhaps as a result of education from their physicians and/or more time and experience with the medications. UC patients rated quality of
care higher at 6 months than did GCM patients, a puzzling outcome that could represent some negative feelings
in the GCM patients that physicians needed help from
GCMs in order to provide care.
The GCM case notes illustrated the investment of time
required, with an average of 46 interactions per patient.
Although physicians valued the contributions of GCMs
and spent a very small amount of extra time themselves to
interact with GCMs, doctors were unwilling in their current fee for service environment to consider hiring and
paying for GCMs themselves.
The patient population in this pilot study was weighted
even more towards females (96%), minorities (40%), and
patients with low educational status (45%) than other
rural patient populations studied [4]. Along with the significant physical ailments, our population is quite disadvantaged and presents substantial challenges for
physicians and health care systems in the design of intervention strategies to improve outcomes.

Conclusion
A small pilot program designed and tested training materials, patient treatment algorithms and care management
protocols for depression utilizing GCMs residing in two
primary care practices. The NC Medicaid program adapted
our antidepressant medication dosing algorithm and the
GCM training and care protocol for implementation into

selected primary care practices. From July 2005 through
June 2007 the NC Medicaid program is reimbursing practices for providing GCM services for depressed patients
and will be monitoring service utilization data and PHQ9 patient outcomes. GCMs appear to be a feasible intervention for community medical practices; however, given
the many questions raised by our data, we believe that a
larger scale trial is warranted to test the appropriateness
for Medicaid programs nationally.
