The Effects of Constraint-Induced Therapy
on Precision Grip: A Preliminary Study
Jay L. Alberts, Andrew J. Butler, and Steven L. Wolf

Objective. This preliminary study examines the effects of
a 2-week constraint-induced therapy (CIT) intervention
on the force-producing capabilities of the hemiparetic
hand during the performance of a functional dexterous
manipulation task. Methods. A 6-degree-of-freedom
force/torque transducer that was embedded into the
handle of a key allowed for the quantification of grasping forces and torques produced during the performance of a functional key-turning task. Clinical and
kinetic data were collected from <n>10</n> subacute patients
(3–9 months poststroke) who were participating in an
ongoing national clinical study (EXCITE trial) examining the effects of CIT on upper extremity motor performance. Investigators were blinded to treatment designation. Five patients receiving treatment immediately
completed 2 weeks of intensive CIT, whereas a group randomized to treatment 1 year later did not receive any
therapy during a similar 2-week span. Results. Results
indicated that 4 of the 5 patients in the CIT group, compared to the delayed group, showed significant clinical
improvements in hand function, increased maximum
precision grip force, improved force and torque regulation, and reduced variability in rate of force production
during task performance. Conclusions. Improved force
control may be a mechanism contributing to the
observed improvements in dexterous function in those
patients undergoing CIT.

vors may no longer be able to use their more
affected upper extremity (UE).2,3 One approach
that is gaining interest, aimed at enhancing UE
motor performance among patients with stroke, is
constraint-induced movement therapy (CIT).4,5
Forced use6 and CIT are neurorehabilitation
techniques that have been shown to improve
motor function of the hemiparetic limb of stroke
patients.7 A typical CIT program consists of a
period of intensive motor training in the form of
repetitive and adaptive task practice of the more
affected limb while activity of the less affected limb
is constrained by a mitt or sling.5,8 During these
intensive sessions, a trainer supervises the practice
of functional patient-selected tasks. The demands
of the task are increased as gains are made.
The underlying mechanism(s) responsible for
improved motor function of patients undergoing
CIT is not well understood. A possible reason for
this lack of understanding may lie in the methods
used in assessing UE functions, especially those
governing the hand. Most studies rely on clinical
tests (Wolf Motor Function Test [WMFT], FuglMeyer Assessment Test [FMA], Frenchay Arm Test,
Nine Hole Peg Test, self-report Motor Activity Log
[MAL]) or maximum grip strength (using a power
grip) to assess UE and hand function pre-post CIT.
In general, these tests provide clinical information
regarding functional status of the impaired limb or
how fast a patient can complete a series of tasks, or
they assess the patient’s perception of how well he
or she can use his or her UE. More objective outcome measures are necessary if the mechanisms
underlying stroke motor deficits and CIT are to be
understood.

producing capabilities of the hemiparetic hand
during the performance of a functional dexterous
task. A secondary aim was to determine the feasibility of using this functional dexterous manipulation task along with biomechanical measures to
quantify hand function of stroke patients in a clinical setting. Although others9-11 have studied the
effects of stroke on reaching and grasping, to our
knowledge, this is the 1st investigation in which
grasping forces and torques produced during a
functional task were quantified in an attempt to
understand how CIT affects grasping force control.

METHODS

mitt. Patients wore this mitt for approximately 90%
of their waking hours during the intervention.
These patients attended CIT training sessions 5
days per week for up to 6 h per day for 2 consecutive weeks. Shaping, or adaptive task practice and
repetitive task practice techniques were used during the training sessions. Typical activities
included stacking checkers, flipping cards, picking
up marbles, insertion of bolts in holes, stacking
canned goods, and other activities similar to those
performed on a daily basis. All training was oneon-one with a rehabilitation specialist.

Data Collection

Participants
Data were collected from 10 right-handed subacute patients (3–9 months since stroke) who were
participating in an ongoing national clinical trial
examining the effects of CIT on UE motor performance and quality of life.8 Study design, including
detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, has been
reported previously.8 Briefly, all patients had only
1 stroke, at least 20 degrees active wrist extension,
10 degrees active finger extension, minimum passive range of motion of 90 degrees for shoulder
flexion and abduction, score of at least 24 on the
Mini Mental State Exam, and they were not receiving any other therapy at the time of the study (for
more details, see previous publication 8 ). Ten
patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups;
immediate or delayed CIT. Patients assigned to the
immediate group began CIT approximately 3 days
after their preintervention evaluations, whereas
the delayed group was scheduled to receive CIT
approximately 1 year later. Group assignment was
unknown to the investigators. Only after posttest
data were completely analyzed was the principal
investigator of the EXCITE trial (SLW) informed of
group assignment. Patient demographics are provided in Table 1. Written informed consent was
obtained before participation from each patient in
accordance with the Emory University institutional
review board.

CIT Intervention
The immediate group underwent 2 weeks of
CIT in which the less affected hand was placed in a

Prior to group assignment, all patients performed the maximum precision grip and key-turning experiments. Patients in the immediate group
repeated the experiment after completing the CIT
program (posttest data were gathered within 1
week after their final CIT session). Patients in the
delayed group were tested 2 weeks after their initial group assignment. During this interval, the
delayed group members did not participate in any
formal rehabilitation programs. Clinical motor
function data were collected for both groups after
group assignment and approximately 2 weeks
later. The WMFT12 and FMA (Arm and Hand section; maximum score 66, where higher scores indicate greater function) were used as clinical markers of UE motor function. The WMFT is designed to
assess the motor ability of patients with moderate
to severe UE motor deficits in the laboratory and
clinic and is composed of functional activities,
such as lifting a pencil and folding a towel and
turning a key in a lock. Fifteen of the 17 items are
timed, whereas the other 2 items assess strength;
the final time score is the median time required for
all timed tasks performance. An evaluator blinded
to group assignment performed pre- and postWMFT and FMA assessments.

Maximum Grip Force Testing
For maximum force trials, participants used
their best precision grip to exert their maximum
force against a Nano-17 Model force transducer
that was embedded in the handle of a key. Data
from three 10-sec trials were collected with the
more affected hand, 2-min rest between trials.
Patients were instructed to exert maximum effort

during each trial while the experimenter verbally
encouraged the patient to continue squeezing with
greater effort. The highest force achieved on these
trials was considered their maximum.

(N/m)

A modified version of the key-turning task in the
WMFT was used to assess grasping forces. Figure
1A provides an illustration of the experimental
setup. A standard dead-bolt lock was affixed to a
wooden support. To simulate the resistance experienced when opening a lock, a spring was placed
within the internal locking mechanism; thus, as
participants turned the key to the left or right of
center, resistance to movement increased. A housing was machined to hold the transducer in the
handle of the key. Grasping forces and torques
were collected at 200 Hz. The forces and torques
about each axis are shown in Figure 1B (grip force
was defined as Fz, whereas load force is the resultant force of Fx and Fy). Data were collected with a
customized LabView program. Force and torque
data were digitally filtered with a 4th-order nophase-lag filter with a cutoff = 10.43 Hz and
processed off-line using MatLab.
Prior to each trial, the experimenter ensured
that the key was securely inserted in the lock at the
12 o’clock or 0° position. An auditory “Go” from
the computer signaled the patient to reach and
grasp the handle of the key, using precision grip if
possible. Upon reaching the key, participants
turned it clockwise 90° (3 o’clock position), back
to 0°, counterclockwise 90° (9 o’clock position),
and returned back at the 0° position. Reference
lines were drawn on the key support to guide keyturning amplitude. The elastic resistance at the two
90° degree locations was approximately 0.75 N/m.
No specific instructions were given to the patient
regarding the speed of key-turning. Five trials
were attempted with the more affected hand (1min rest between trials). Force and torque profiles
for a healthy adult (46-year-old male) are provided
in Figure 1C. These data were used to develop an
algorithm to approximate key position while performing key-turning task. The key-turning task
was not included as one of the activities performed
during the 2 weeks of CIT training. The kinetic data
were collected at the Emory study site, whereas all
kinetic analyses were performed at Georgia Tech
by blinded technicians not involved in data
collection.

Data Analysis
A 2 × 2 (group × time) repeated measures
ANOVA was used to identify any interaction or
main effects. In cases where statistical significance
(P < 0.05) was observed, paired t tests were used to
follow up any interaction or main effects. Because
this study was preliminary in nature, greater
emphasis was placed on individual patient data
analysis and trends within each group.

Clinical Assessment

from pre- to postdata for the timed components
along with the time to perform the key-turning task
and FMA data, for the more affected hand during
pre- and posttest sessions, are provided in Table 1.
A nearly significant group-by-time interaction was

present for the overall change in WMFT median
time (F1,8 = 4.15, P = 0.07). Results indicated that 4
of the 5 patients in the immediate group exhibited
a decrease in the median time to perform the tasks
within the WMFT (where lower numbers indicate
less time to complete tasks). The total time to perform these tasks was reduced, on average 27.9%,
with the range of reduction from 15% to 60%. Two
patients in the delayed group did reduce their
times, whereas 3 patients actually increased their
performance times. On average, the delayed group
showed a 5.6% increase in overall WMFT time.
There were no significant differences between the
delayed and immediate group on the FMA test
from pre- to postassessment conditions. As shown
in Table 1, no clear trend or pattern of results was
present regarding the change in FMA score
between the 2 groups.
In general, all patients, during the pretest used
what could be characterized as a “modified pinch
grip” compared to a traditional precision grip. With
the modified pinch grip, the key was typically contacted with the pad of the thumb and lateral border
of the index finger compared to a traditional precision grip in which the pads of the thumb and index
finger are in contact with the object (key). After CI
training, 3 patients in the immediate group
transitioned to using a more traditional precision
grip whereas the remaining patients continued to
use a variation of the “modified pinch grip.” Four
of the 5 patients in the immediate group showed a
reduction in the time to perform the key-turning
task. One patient (pt. 8) in the immediate group
was not able to complete the task during pre- or
posttest sessions. Overall, the immediate group
reduced movement time by 47% after CIT. Four of
the 5 patients in the delayed group did not exhibit
any change in their movement time from pre- to
posttest sessions. Two patients in the delayed
group were not able to perform the key-turning
task in either session. One patient in the delayed
group required more time to perform the task in
the posttest compared to the pretest. On average,
the delayed group required 15% more time to perform the key-turning task in the posttest than pretest session. Statistically there were no significant
interactions or main effects, as the variability
within and between groups was substantial.

Strength Changes
Patients in the immediate group increased maximum grip force, whereas patients in the delayed

group showed little change in maximum force. A
significant group-by-time interaction was present
for maximum precision grip force (F1,8 = 6.80; P <
0.05). Patients in the immediate group showed a
significant increase in their maximum forceproducing capabilities as force increased from 11.3
N to 19.9 N after the CIT intervention (t 1,4 = –2.76;
P = 0.05). Pretest (14.5 N) and posttest (15.0 N)
maximum forces were not different for the delayed
group. Both groups’ maximum strength was less
than that typically produced by younger collegeaged adults (52.68 N) and healthy older adults
(48.76 N) in our earlier studies.

Grasping Forces and
Torques during Key-Turning
Representative force and torque profiles for
patients in the immediate and delayed group while
performing the key-turning task with the moreaffected hand during the pretest session are provided in Figure 2. Inspection of the grasping data
gathered in the pretest session indicates that
patients in both groups produced irregular and
nonsystematic grasping forces. Despite the inconsistent force profiles produced during these trials,
the patients successfully performed the task as
instructed (e.g., turn the key to the right, back to
the center, and then to the left). Torque profiles in
the X and Y dimensions during these turning
actions were equally irregular and nonsystematic
across patients in both groups.
Grasping force and torque data from the
posttest session, patients in the immediate and
delayed groups, are provided in Figure 3. Grasping
forces produced by those in the delayed group
were similar from pre- to posttest conditions. The
delayed group continued to produce irregular and
uncoupled grip and load forces. Inspection of the
grasping profiles for the patients undergoing CIT
indicates that the generation of grip force
improved in the posttest compared to pretest performance. The most striking feature of grasping
forces produced by patients after CIT was their relatively smooth and monotonic increase in grip
force production, compared to pretest conditions.
Further inspection of their grasping profiles indicates that 2 dominant control patterns emerged in
the controlling of their grasping forces. One
patient (pt. 10) tended to produce a grip force that
was sufficiently large throughout the key-turning
action; this strategy allowed the patient to maintain
contact with the key to overcome changes in load

tinctive peaks in the grip and load forces. As these
patients initiated key-turning from the start position (#1-hatched arrow) to position 2 (filled
arrow), a monotonic increase in grip force was
observed. When turning the key back from position 2 to position 3 (open arrow), these patients
reduced grip force as they turned the key back to
the initial position and then increased grip force
while turning the key to position 3. Finally,
patients reduced grip force as they returned the
key to the initial position. The reduction in grip
force when turning the key back toward the starting position may reflect patients’ taking advantage
of the reduction in resistance as the spring was
being unloaded. One patient in the immediate
group (pt. 8) did not demonstrate any qualitative
changes in the consistency or smoothness of grip
force production; furthermore, this patient was not
able to successfully perform the task in the allotted
2 min in either the pre- or posttesting sessions.
The rate (∆f/∆t) of grip force profiles for 5 successful key-turning trials for pre- and posttest sessions for 1 patient from the delayed group and 1
from the immediate group are shown in Figure 5.
Plots A and C of Figure 5 represent the rate of grip
force production for a patient in the delayed group
during pre- and posttesting sessions, respectively.
This patient produced force-rate profiles that were
multipeaked, irregular, and nonsystematic. Plots B
and D of Figure 5 represent grip force-rate profiles
for a patient in the immediate group. During the
pretest (plot B), the patient produced force-rate
profiles that were similar to patients in the delayed
group (e.g., multiple peaks and nonsystematic).
However, after CIT (plot D), this patient consistently produced smooth, bimodal force-rate
profiles.

data are provided in Table 1. Although there were
no significant differences between groups in terms

group. Three of the patients in the immediate
group did exhibit substantial reductions in preload
time. Patients in the delayed group did not demonstrate marked improvement in their preloading
times.

DISCUSSION
The aim of this preliminary study was to assess
changes in the control of grasping forces in
patients with subacute stroke who participated in
an intensive 2-week CIT program. Results indicated that CIT, in general, led to an increase in
maximum precision grip force and improved consistency and modulation of grasping forces.
Results from the clinical motor assessment measure (WMFT) indicated the CIT led to an overall
improvement in UE function as time to perform
these tasks decreased.
The WMFT data are consistent with previous
investigations showing that CIT is effective in
improving UE motor function as assessed by clinical rating scales,13-15 whereas the FMA data are not
as clear. The overall reduction in time to perform
the WMFT, in particular, the key-turning, was dramatic for 4 of the 5 CIT patients. These data suggest

256

that CIT leads to an improvement in distal UE function of the hemiparetic limb. Improved hand
function of the more affected limb of stroke
patients is encouraging and may lead to CIT being
embraced as a technique for improving the motor
performance of stroke patients. To our knowledge,
these are the 1st data that provide evidence for
improvement in the dexterous abilities of patients
with stroke following CIT.
Despite promising reports of CIT improving UE
motor function,7,13 little is known regarding the
mechanism(s) underlying improvements in motor
function. Our data suggest that CIT led to a reduction in force variability for this type of dexterous
task. The impulse-variability theory assumes that
movements are programmed and that the variability in the forces produced and in the durations over
which these forces are applied are the major determinants of the variability of limb trajectory.16,17
Based on our pretest data, patients in both groups
produce highly variable and irregular grasping
forces during key-turning. However, after CIT, 4 of
the 5 patients were able to decrease the variability
of their digit forces and 2 of these patients exhibited modulation of grasping forces. The consistency of the force-rate profiles across trials for
those patients who modulated their grasping
forces suggests that they were able to reduce the
overall variability of digit forces and the duration
necessary to apply these forces. A possible mechanism responsible for improved dexterous ability
after CIT is improved control of muscle force. CIT
may lead to a generalized improvement in the control of forces, as patients in the CIT group
improved performance on the key-turning task
even though this task was not part of the CIT training activities. Greater consistency and predictability in the control of forces could result in patients
utilizing more of a preprogramming or feed-forward movement control strategy. Our data suggest
CIT may allow patients to utilize more of a preprogramming movement control strategy, because the
rate of force production was greater and more
consistent, and movement time to perform UE
tasks tended to decrease after the CIT intervention.
In a review of the strength training literature
related to the rehabilitation of stroke patients, Ng
and Shepherd18 suggested that strength directly
relates to functional improvements in stroke
patients. Daily tasks do require a minimum amount
of strength for their performance; if individuals
lack adequate strength levels, then performance
will certainly be impaired. The current data suggest that absolute strength is not a predictor of dexterous ability. One patient (pt. 8) in the immediate

group showed nearly a 128% gain in maximum
force production (15.4 N to 35.1 N) from pre- to
posttesting sessions. This patient had the greatest
maximum precision grip of patients from either
group. Even with these impressive strength gains,
this patient could not perform the key-turning task
in either the pre- or posttest sessions. Furthermore,
despite a large overlap in maximum strength levels
between groups, the delayed group produced
irregular and inconsistent forces and torques during key-turning. Successful performance of daily
activities does require a minimum force. However,
these data indicate the ability to control muscle
forces with precision is of greater importance for
the performance of fine motor activities involving
the distal musculature, such as turning a key in a
lock, than maximum strength levels, especially if
one has sufficient strength to perform a given task.
A recent study investigating the effects of stroke
on the control of grasping forces highlighted the
need to use precise objective and quantitative
measures when attempting to understand the
effects of stroke on hand function.11 Although
patients with stroke were able to transport and
cycle objects throughout space, they produced
excessive grip forces, relative to healthy controls,
during the performance of these actions.11 Excessive grip force or “safety margin” has been suggested to contribute to diminished hand function
of older adults19,20; it is reasonable to suggest that
this lack of precision in the control of grasping
forces in older adults also contributes to their
decline in dexterous function. In the current study,
the modifications and fabrication procedures for
implementing the force transducer into the key
required a modest amount of effort. Data collection and analyses programs were easily created
with LabView and MatLab software. The force and
torque data gathered during this well-practiced
functional activity allows for an objective and
quantitative assessment of how stroke affects hand
function. Accurate measurement of grasping
forces provides a more complete picture of specific movement parameters that may be impacted
by a therapeutic intervention, such as CIT. A
clearer understanding of what movement parameters are changing and the nature of their change
can provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for improved motor performance as a result
of a given intervention. Future studies interested in
the effects of stroke and rehabilitation interventions on hand and UE function should consider
employing objective biomechanical measures that
capture the dynamic control properties of the

movement in addition to maximum strength
measures.
The absence of kinematic data in the current
study is a limitation, as estimates of key position
had to be made. The grasping force and torque
data collected during the pretest sessions were so
irregular that estimating key position was impossible. As grasping force production improved for the
immediate group, identifying the extreme positions of the key was possible based on changes in
force magnitude. Collecting position data from the
entire UE, trunk, and key would allow for a more
complete understanding of how these key-turning
movements are controlled. Kinematic measures
would provide insight into how stroke affects the
control of multiple degrees of freedom of the limb
and trunk and how CIT affects the control of the
proximal and distal degrees of freedom. Larger
scale follow-up studies are planned to examine
these issues systematically. Nevertheless, the
change in rate of grip force production and modulation of grip forces in 3 of the 5 patients undergoing CIT were evident and suggest that CIT is
improving digit force production. To further
understand the effects of stroke and CIT on structure-function relationships with respect to the control of grasping forces, efforts should be made to
collect data from a more homogeneous patient
group in terms of lesion location. Future studies
are planned to investigate the persistence of
changes in force control in subacute stroke
patients undergoing CIT and how the group of
chronic patients respond to CIT in term of force
control.
