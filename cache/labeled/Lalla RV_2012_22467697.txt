Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Background—Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a painful condition of unknown etiology,
affecting more than 2.5 billion people worldwide. Vitamin deficiencies have been implicated as a
possible cause.
Methods—The authors conducted a single-center, randomized, parallel-arm, double-masked,
placebo-controlled study to examine the effect of daily multivitamin supplementation on the
number and duration of RAS episodes. The authors randomly assigned <n>160</n> adults who had a
validated history of at least three episodes of idiopathic minor RAS within the previous 12 months
to one of two groups: the first group (n = 83) received a once-daily multivitamin containing 100
percent of the U.S. reference daily intake (RDI) of essential vitamins, and the second group (n =
77) received once-daily placebo for up to 365 days.
Results—The results showed no significant difference in the mean number of new RAS episodes
between the multivitamin (4.19 episodes) and placebo (4.60 episodes) arms during the study
period (P = .69). The mean duration of new RAS episodes also was similar for the multivitamin
(8.66 days) and placebo (8.99 days) arms (P = .60). Furthermore, the authors found no differences

between the two arms with regard to mouth pain, normalcy of diet or compliance with the study
medication regimen.

Conclusion—Daily multivitamin supplementation, with the RDI of essential vitamins, did not
result in a reduction in the number or duration of RAS episodes.
Clinical Implications—Clinicians should not recommend multi-vitamin supplementation
routinely as prophylaxis for RAS.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), also known as “canker sores,” is a common disease,
affecting an estimated 2.5 billion people worldwide.1 Clinically, this disease manifests as
recurrent, painful oral ulcerations. Three clinical types have been described: minor, major
and herpetiform.2 Owing to their painful nature, RAS lesions can affect nutrition, speech
and oral hygiene.3 Thus, RAS can result in significant morbidity and a diminished quality of
life.4,5 Patients who experience major RAS develop large, painful oral ulcerations that often
last for several weeks and heal with scarring. The etiology of RAS is not well understood,
which hampers the development of effective therapies for prevention or treatment. Several
factors have been implicated, including genetics, stress, allergies and autoimmunity.2 In
addition, a substantial body of literature indicates that some patients with RAS have vitamin
deficiencies.
Researchers in several studies have implicated vitamin deficiencies—including vitamin
B12,6–10 folic acid,8,9,11 vitamin B1, B2 and B6—in the pathogenesis of RAS.12,13 For
example, investigators in one study found that 28 percent of patients with RAS had a
deficiency of one or more of the B vitamins tested (B1, B2 and B6). In these patients,
replacement therapy for the deficient vitamins significantly reduced the number of days with
RAS.13 Investigators in other studies also reported that specific replacement therapy to
correct vitamin deficiencies (notably B12 and folic acid) can be effective in improving the
patient’s condition or leading to remission.9,10,14 The results of studies of therapy with a
combination vitamin/herbal supplement (LongoVital, Cederroth, Upplands Väsby, Sweden)
indicated that daily prophylactic use resulted in a reduced number of RAS lesions, even in
the absence of serologic vitamin deficiency.15,16 However, because this supplement contains
both vitamins and herbal supplements, the specific contribution of vitamins is not clear.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Thus, the role of vitamin deficiencies in RAS is not well understood. Furthermore, testing
for vitamin deficiencies is invasive and expensive, and it is not done routinely in the clinical
management of RAS. Currently used therapies (such as steroids) have significant adverse
effects. Therefore, we sought to identify a low-cost, non-toxic strategy for the prevention of
RAS lesions. We performed this study to examine the efficacy of daily multivitamin
supplementation in a group of patients with RAS.

METHODS
Study design
We conducted a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, single-center
study at the University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, after having received
institutional review board approval. All participants provided written informed consent.

Participants

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We recruited participants from the general population of Hartford County, Connecticut, via
flyers posted at various locations, e-mails to the health center community and
advertisements in local newspapers. People 18 years and older with a validated history of at
least three episodes of idiopathic minor RAS within the previous 12 months were eligible
for the study. One of three study investigators (R.V.L., L.E.C., H.Z.) questioned volunteers
about the location, duration and appearance of reported lesions and showed them
photographs of RAS lesions and of other oral ulcerative lesions to validate their history of
RAS. Exclusion criteria included smoking, pregnancy, regular use of vitamin supplements
or any over-the-counter or prescription agents for RAS, and a diagnosis of a systemic
condition that can cause oral ulceration. Detailed exclusion criteria are available at
www.clinicaltrials.gov, where the trial is registered under identifier number NCT00527306.
Interventions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The active agent tested was a generic multivitamin supplement containing only the U.S.
reference daily intake (RDI) of the essential vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, B12, C, D
and E.17 The active agent did not contain any other micronutrients or supplements such as
iron or calcium. The placebo consisted of lactose powder. A pharmacy technician inserted
the multivitamin and placebo into identically colored gelatin capsules at the University of
Connecticut Health Center Research Pharmacy. Thus, the multivitamin and placebo capsules
had the same external physical appearance, taste and texture. We instructed participants to
take one capsule per day for 365 days and to record use of the medication in a study diary.
Randomization and masking
The research pharmacist assigned participants randomly to the multivitamin or placebo
groups (1:1 allocation ratio) by using a computer-based pseudorandom number generator.
We used a stratified randomization with a fixed block size of 20 participants. We defined
strata as low RAS frequency (three or four RAS episodes in the year before the study; group
A) or high RAS frequency (five or more episodes in the previous year; group B). The
research pharmacist dispensed the treatments and kept confidential records of study drug
assignment, which were not accessible to study investigators during the study.
Clinical data collection

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Baseline visit—At the baseline study visit, we performed the following procedures:
screened prospective participants; obtained medical histories, including use of any
medications; conducted clinical oral examinations; educated participants about RAS and
other oral ulcers; dispensed the study medication; distributed the study diary forms and
instructions for study participation, including use of the study medication; and took a
baseline blood sample to determine vitamin B12 and folate levels. We also showed
photographs of RAS and non-RAS oral ulcers to participants for reference.
Six-month visit—At the six-month recall visit, one of three investigators (R.V.L., L.E.C.,
H.Z.) updated participants’ medical histories, including current medications; performed a
clinical oral examination; reeducated participants about RAS and other oral ulcers;
dispensed additional study medication and study diary pages; collected completed study
diary pages (from the first six months); and provided oral and written reinforcement of
instructions in use of the study medication.
One-year visit—At the one-year study visit (the final visit), one of the three investigators
performed the following procedures: collected completed study diary pages (from the

J Am Dent Assoc. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 January 03.

second six months); updated medical histories, including current medications; and
conducted clinical oral examinations.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to the three scheduled study visits, we asked participants to return for additional
study visits when they developed new episodes of mouth sores during the one-year study
period. We defined a new episode as the onset of mouth sores after at least one day without
any mouth sores. At these visits, a masked dentist or dental hygienist using calibrated
technique obtained a detailed medical history and performed an oral examination to
determine whether the mouth sores were RAS. If the dentist or dental hygienist determined
that the mouth sores were not RAS, he or she referred the participant for additional clinical
evaluation if appropriate. We paid participants $25 for each completed study visit.
Participants completed written diaries consisting of data regarding onset and duration of
each RAS episode experienced during study participation. We instructed them to record
these data on the basis of the first and last day on which they were aware of the presence of
an RAS lesion. In addition, participants recorded mouth pain scores and normalcy of diet
scores for each day of an RAS episode. We gave participants postage-paid envelopes for
return of the completed forms.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We asked participants to bring in bottles of capsules at the six- and 12-month study visits so
that we could count the number of remaining pills. However, their compliance with this
request was suboptimal and, therefore, we were unable to obtain satisfactory data regarding
pill counts. In addition, at each study visit (that is, baseline, six months and any intervening
RAS episode visit), we asked participants about compliance with the study medication
regimen and reinforced the importance of taking the medication as instructed.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measures were the number and duration of RAS episodes during the
one-year study period. Secondary outcome measures included mouth pain and normalcy of
diet during RAS episodes. We assessed mouth pain during RAS episodes by asking
participants to indicate the daily level of mouth pain (worst, least, average and pain now) on
an 11-point validated scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).18 We
assessed normalcy of diet by using a validated Normalcy of Diet scale,19 on which
participants rated (during RAS episodes) the highest ranking food they could eat each day
(ranging from 0 [no alimentation possible] to 10 [full diet]).
Sample size and statistical methods

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We calculated study sample size on the basis of 80 percent power and 0.05 α to detect at
least a 65 percent probability that a randomly chosen participant from the multivitamin arm
had a superior outcome (that is, fewer episodes, episodes of shorter duration or both) when
compared with that for a randomly chosen participant from the placebo arm. On the basis of
these parameters, we estimated that a final sample size of at least 100 participants (50 per
arm) completing the study would be needed to achieve adequate power after accounting for
dropouts.
We conducted baseline group comparisons of demographic variables and baseline vitamin
levels by using the unpaired t test for continuous measures and the χ2 test for categorical
measures. A few participants with severe disease had multiple overlapping RAS lesions that
they reported as one long episode. On the basis of published data20 indicating that the
maximum duration of minor RAS episodes is 21 days, we treated such episodes as multiple
episodes of up to 21 days each for the analyses.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Main outcome measures—For the first main outcome—duration of RAS episodes—we
used a linear mixed model with “treatment” (multivitamin or placebo) as the exposure and
“duration in days” as the dependent variable. Episodes were clustered within participants
and we treated the intercept as random, allowing for differing numbers of episodes among
study participants. For the second main outcome—number of episodes—we used an analysis
of covariance with “treatment” as the exposure and “length of study participation” as the
covariate to enable us to adjust for a variable length of follow-up.
Secondary outcome measures—Analyses for the secondary outcome measures—
mouth pain and diet—also involved the use of linear mixed models because participants
could provide multiple observations for both of these measures. We included additional
covariates—sex and number of episodes in the previous year—in the above models to assess
their effects on parameter estimates. We did not perform any statistical analyses before all
participants completed their participation in the study. We performed all analyses by using
statistical software (PASW Statistics 18, IBM SPSS, Armonk, N.Y.).

RESULTS
Participants

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We enrolled a total of 160 participants in this study and randomly assigned 83 to the
multivitamin arm and 77 to the placebo arm. The stratified block randomization resulted in
an even distribution of participants across the low and high RAS frequency groups (that is,
groups A and B), as well as comparable demographics and baseline levels of vitamin B12
and red blood cell (RBC) folate across the two treatment arms (Table 1). Baseline vitamin
B12 levels were low (less than 201 picograms per milliliters) in 14 of the 160 participants (9
percent). Of these 14 participants, five were randomized to the multivitamin arm (all five in
group B) and nine were randomized to the placebo arm (four in group A [low RAS
frequency] and five in group B [high RAS frequency]). For participants with low baseline
levels of B12, there was no significant difference in the incidence of new RAS episodes
during the period of study participation between the five participants randomized to the
multivitamin arm and the nine participants randomized to the placebo arm (P = .0162).
Baseline RBC folate levels were low (less than 237 nanograms/mL) in two participants. We
randomly assigned one of these participants to the multivitamin arm (group B) and one to
the placebo arm (group B). We did not perform any statistical analyses pertaining to low
baseline RBC folate levels because of the low number of such participants.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Twenty-five of 83 participants (30 percent) in the multivitamin arm and 21 of 77
participants (27 percent) in the placebo arm did not complete the study. In most cases, they
gave no specific reason for dropping out. Thus, 58 participants in the multivitamin arm and
56 participants in the placebo arm completed the entire one-year study. All participants
(including those who withdrew) reported a total of 779 new RAS episodes during the study.
For 575 of these episodes, the participant underwent a clinical examination during the
episode; a dentist or dental hygienist confirmed that 498 of these 575 episodes (87 percent)
were RAS and determined that 77 of these episodes (13 percent) were not RAS. We
removed the latter episodes from the analyses.
Compliance with study medication regimen
We calculated compliance in two ways. When we compared the number of days that
participants reported having taken their study medication with the total number of days for
which they provided responses in the study diary, the mean compliance rates were 92.6
percent and 94.4 percent for the multivitamin and placebo arms, respectively (P = .43).
However, when we compared the number of days that participants reported taking the study

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

medication with the total number of days that they were in the study (thus, assuming
conservatively that participants did not take the study medication on days in which they did
not provide responses in the medication diary), compliance rates were 63.3 percent and 54.8
percent for the multivitamin and placebo arms, respectively (P = .21).
Incidence of RAS episodes
We examined the incidence of new RAS episodes in an intent-to-treat analysis of all 160
randomized participants, after adjusting for the duration of study participation. Thus, we
compared the incidence in the 83 participants in the multivitamin arm (who collectively
reported 348 RAS episodes) with that in the 77 participants in the placebo arm (who
collectively reported 354 episodes). The results show no significant difference in the mean
number of new RAS episodes between that in the multivitamin arm and that in the placebo
arm during the study period (Table 2). The results of factorial analysis of variance showed
no treatment effect (P = .69) and no interaction between treatment and group (that is, A or
B) (P = .40). However, we found a significant A/B group effect (P = .025). Participants with
a history of more frequent RAS episodes (group B) reported, on average, almost twice as
many new RAS episodes (4.79) during the study period as did participants who had a history
of less frequent RAS episodes (group A, 2.50 new episodes). Sex did not interact with
treatment or A/B group, and the results showed no main effect for sex.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Duration of RAS episodes
Twenty-two participants in the multivitamin arm and 14 participants in the placebo arm did
not experience any new RAS episodes during the study period; therefore, we could not
include them in the duration analyses. Thus, we compared the duration of episodes in 61
participants in the multivitamin arm who experienced at least one RAS episode during the
study period with that in 63 participants in the placebo arm who experienced at least one
RAS episode. The mean duration of each RAS episode in participants in the multivitamin
arm was 8.66 days compared with 8.99 days in those in the placebo arm (P = .60) (Table 3).
A/B group and sex did not interact significantly with treatment with regard to duration of
RAS episodes, and there was no main effect for either variable.
Mouth pain during RAS episodes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We excluded from this analysis 36 of 160 participants (22 in the multivitamin arm and 14 in
the placebo arm) who did not experience any new RAS episodes during the study period.
Therefore, we compared mouth pain during RAS episodes in 61 participants in the
multivitamin arm with that in 63 participants in the placebo arm. We found no differences
between the multivitamin and placebo arms regarding worst pain (P = .63), least pain (P = .
58), average pain (P = .57) or pain right now (P = .50) (Table 4). A/B group and sex did not
interact significantly with treatment with regard to mouth pain scores, and there was no main
effect for either variable.
Normalcy of diet during RAS episodes
Thirty-nine participants (22 in the multivitamin arm and 17 in the placebo arm) did not
provide any normalcy of diet data during an RAS episode; therefore, we compared data from
61 participants in the multivitamin arm with data from 60 participants in the placebo arm for
these analyses. The mean diet scores were similar (9.48 for the multivitamin arm and 9.70
for the placebo arm; P = .18). A/B group and sex did not interact significantly with
treatment with regard to diet scores, and there was no main effect for either variable.

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In a subset of patients with RAS, specific replacement therapy to correct vitamin
deficiencies can improve the patient’s condition or induce remission.9,10,13,14 However, with
the exception of some specialists, clinicians rarely perform serum testing for vitamin
deficiencies in patients with RAS. In this study, we examined the merits of an alternative
approach: daily supplementation in all patients with RAS with the U.S. RDI of essential
vitamins. Multivitamin supplements at these levels are safe and have been recommended for
various population groups.21,22 The safety of this regimen also was evidenced by the
absence of reported adverse events associated with its use in our study population.
The number of new RAS episodes did not differ significantly according to treatment arm. As
expected, participants with fewer RAS episodes before enrollment experienced fewer
episodes during the study period than did participants with a history of more frequent RAS
episodes. These findings validate the stratification strategy used, which balanced expected
numbers of RAS episodes across treatment arms.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because the major morbidity of these ulcerative lesions results from pain, any reduction in
the duration of the lesions can have significant benefits for patients. However, neither the
mean duration of RAS episodes nor the associated pain was significantly different between
the two arms. Normalcy of diet scores were high in both groups, indicating that minor RAS
did not have a significant effect on the consistency of foods that participants could tolerate.
However, because patients with RAS often report pain on consuming acidic and spicy foods,
a diet scale focused on such attributes may better quantify the effects of RAS on diet than
does the consistency-based scale we used.
Limitations of this study include the reliance on self-reported data from participants to
determine the presence and duration of RAS episodes. However, participants received a
clinical examination during study visits for almost 75 percent of all reported episodes of
RAS. The dentist or dental hygienist determined that 13 percent of these episodes were not
RAS, and we removed them from our analyses. If we were to extrapolate this finding to the
remaining 25 percent of reported episodes for which a clinical examination was not possible,
we can estimate that only an additional 3.25 percent of these episodes may not have been
RAS. We would not expect this to change the outcome of the study.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Another limitation is the inherent difficulty in measuring compliance with pill taking,
particularly in a yearlong trial. Thus, we cannot prove that participants took the study
medication exactly as reported in their written diaries. Although some helpful devices are
available, such as bottle caps that register how often the bottle is opened, the cost of these
for a large and long clinical trial can be prohibitive.
Many investigators in the studies cited earlier found that high-dose replacement therapy with
specific vitamins was helpful in the treatment of RAS in patients with documented vitamin
deficiencies. This may explain the lack of effect in our study, in which we examined lowdose prophylactic multivitamin use in a population largely without vitamin deficiencies. In a
randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial of once-daily sublingual vitamin B12
therapy for RAS, Volkov and colleagues23 reported that after six months of treatment, 20 of
27 patients (74 percent) with RAS in the treatment arm were free of ulceration, compared
with eight of 25 patients (32 percent) with RAS in the placebo arm (P < .01). This response
to vitamin B12 was independent of the participant’s initial blood B12 level, which was
normal in most participants. These investigators23 tested 1,000 micrograms of vitamin B12
daily compared with 6 μg in our multivitamin supplement, which may account for the
different outcome in our study.

The findings of our study suggest that in the U.S. population, routine screening of all
patients who have RAS for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies is not warranted. Although
not studied here, clinicians may wish to test for such deficiencies in patients with refractory
RAS or when signs suggestive of such deficiency (for example, tongue depapillation for
vitamin B12 deficiency) are present.

CONCLUSION
Our study findings show that daily multivitamin supplementation, with the RDI of essential
vitamins, did not result in a reduction in the number or duration of RAS episodes. Therefore,
clinicians should not use this prophylactic strategy routinely in patients who have RAS.
