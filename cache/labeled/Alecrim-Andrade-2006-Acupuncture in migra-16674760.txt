The purpose of the present trial was to evaluate semi-standardized acupuncture
efﬁcacy in migraine prophylaxis. <n>Twenty-eight</n> subjects with migraine were
randomized to the real or sham acupuncture groups. Semi-standardized and
standardized minimal acupuncture were used, respectively, in the two groups of
patients. They were all treated with 16 acupuncture sessions in 12 weeks. Both
groups exhibited similar reductions in: percentage of patients with reduction of
migraine ≥40% and ≥50% regarding frequency of migraine attacks, days with
migraine, frequency of migraine attacks, average duration of a migraine attack,
rate of rescue medication used, average headache severity rate and other
parameters compared with the baseline period. Associated symptoms, such as
nausea and vomiting, also showed equal estimates in both groups. These ﬁndings
showed that semi-standardized acupuncture shows no difference from sham
acupuncture in preventing migraine attacks. ᮀAcupuncture, efﬁcacy, headache,

Introduction
Acupuncture has been largely used for migraine sufferers in western countries, although the role it may
play in migraine treatment remains unknown (1–3).
Some trials have pointed out some effects of acupuncture in migraine, but no conclusive results have
been reached, probably because there have been
only a few high-quality trials in this area (4, 5).
Migraine does not exist as an entity in the theory
of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (6). The
basis of acupuncture follows the TCM grounding.
However, there are serious methods of diagnosis,
treatment and practice as far as acupuncture is concerned. In western countries practice sometimes follows the paths of neurophysiology, neuromuscular
and other modern concepts and principles (7).
According to TCM’s principles, treatment should be
individualized (8). Each acupuncturist should treat
520

accordingly to their own experience and feelings. In
fact, acupuncture can be applied in different ways.
Traditional Chinese acupuncture basis has been disregarded in most trials. Usually, a standard treatment has been adopted regardless of the previous
TCM diagnosis (9, 10). Furthermore, several acupuncture techniques have also been applied,
although they cannot be matched to the original
technique (7, 11). Therefore, comparisons of acupuncture trials are very difﬁcult (7). Is there a midway betwwen traditional concepts and the scientiﬁc
approach? The authors thought that the semistandardized acupuncture treatment could be the
best way, because TCM would be partially respected
and the treatment would be easily reproduced in
other trials in the future as well as in clinical practice.
The present trial was developed to evaluate
the efﬁcacy of semi-standardized acupuncture in
migraine prophylaxis.

Acupuncture in migraine prophylaxis

Methods
Study design
The present study was developed in the Headache
Clinic of the Department of Neurology, in the
Clinical Hospital, State University of Campinas
(UNICAMP), Brazil. The protocol and supporting
documents (information sheet, consent form, protocol) were approved by the institutional Ethics Committee in June 2000.
The recruitment of patients was done from August
2002 to March 2003, and the trial was completed
in February 2004 (including all follow-up periods).
Patients were recruited via a media campaign. They
were scheduled by the research assistants and evaluated by an experienced neurologist.
Twenty-eight patients suffering from migraine,
with or without aura, in accordance with the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society
(IHS) (12), present for at least 1 year, male and
female, aged 18–50 years, were enrolled. Other inclusion criteria were: patients with only migraine,
patients who had not used drugs with migraine prophylactic effects or acupuncture in the previous
3 months, patients who could come to the clinical
hospital 17 times only in the following 12 weeks
(acupuncture treatment period) and patients who
had accepted inclusion in the study after oral and
written explanations about the clinical trial. The
exclusion criteria were patients with any other
chronic pain syndrome, who were unable to understand and maintain headache diaries, who were misusing drugs or alcohol and who occasionally used a
minor tranquilizer or sedative.
Prior to enrolment there was a 4-week preliminary phase (baseline period) when patients kept a
diary recording the frequency and intensity of headache, menstruation, drug intake and associated
symptoms in each migraine attack. By that time, the
selected patients had received a written text with
information about all aspects of the trial, including
possible adverse events and their right to withdraw
from the trial at any time without giving reasons.
During that period at least three, but not more than
six migraine attacks, had to occur. A new attack was
considered as such when the patient had been headache free for at least 48 h (13). Patients with nonmigraine types of headaches were excluded as well
as patients who had used drugs for the treatment of
migraine attacks for more than 10 days in 4 weeks.
After the baseline period, during the second neurologist visit, the selected patients signed the written
informed consent. Before acupuncture treatment,

521

the patients were evaluated by a general physician,
who is also an acupuncture specialist (J.A-A.). At
this time, the clinical history and physical evaluation based on the principles of Chinese medicine
were recorded, including examination of the pulse
and tongue. The evaluation was done and the
probable treatment following TCM principles was
planned for all patients in order not to break the
‘blinding’.
After the acupuncture doctor’s evaluation,
patients were randomly assigned to two acupuncture groups, group C and group D, by a research
assistant. The research assistant prepared opaque,
numbered and sealed envelopes containing one of
the two above letters. They were divided into six
blocks. A block had six letters, three letter Cs and
three letter Ds. The random digits (14) were used to
deﬁne the sequence of the letters in each block.
Therefore, the order of the letters was different
for each block. That sequence was unknown by
the medical acupuncturist. The identiﬁcation of
each letter was unknown by the ﬁrst and second
research assistants, the statistician, the neurologist
(evaluator) and the patients. Only the medical acupuncturist knew the meaning of each letter, but she
had not revealed any code before completing all
the data analysis. The second research assistant was
responsible for sending the randomization list to
the statistician at the end of the trial. Group C
received the real acupuncture and group D the
sham acupuncture. The acupuncturist doctor did
not give any information to the patients, neurologist or research assistants about the acupuncture
treatment.
Real and sham acupuncture are deﬁned in World
Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for Clinical Research on Acupuncture (15) as being ‘acupuncture given as a real clinical treatment’ and
‘inappropriate acupuncture for the condition being
treated taking into account the acupuncture
microsystem’.
The patients were submitted to the acupuncture
treatment for 12 consecutive weeks. That included
16 sessions, twice a week during the ﬁrst 4 weeks
and weekly during the following 8 weeks. Patients
had to keep a headache diary from the baseline
period (diary 1) up to follow-up period (diaries
5–10), which was for 24 weeks after the last acupuncture session (approximately 6 months). The
follow-up period was designed to test the longerlasting effects of acupuncture on migraine. During
the acupuncture treatment, the patients completed
three diaries (diaries 2–4). Neurologist visits were
scheduled at weeks 0, 5, 18, 25, 33 and 42.

Treatment of migraine attacks, if they happened,
was done in the customary manner by each
patient. The neurologist withheld any suggestions
as to changes in the ongoing rescue medication
and any comments on the acupuncture treatment
with the patients.

Treatments
Sham acupuncture treatment
1 Twelve needles (six on each side) were inserted in
each session (see Table 1).
2 Minimal acupuncture was used and consisted of
very shallow needle insertion in the acupuncture
points.
3 No manipulation was done.
4 The points in the sham acupuncture group were
selected after an extensive consultation of the classical acupuncture literature to conﬁrm that they
had minimal or no inﬂuence on headaches (16–21).
5 Standardized and ﬁxed acupuncture treatments
were applied to the 16 sessions.

as De Qi. The ‘Qi sensation’ was explained to the
patients of this group in the ﬁrst session as an
awareness of numbness, strange aching or tingling
radiating from the point of needling.
Treatment design in both groups
1 The skin was disinfected with 70% alcohol.
2 Sterile disposable and steel needles (0.25 × 40 mm)
were used.
3 Moxa or electrical stimulation was not used.
4 The patients were kept lying down for 30 min with
the needles in place.
5 Body acupuncture was done bilaterally.

Efﬁcacy evaluation
Efﬁcacy was measured by comparing the ﬁrst diary,
which was made in the baseline period, with the
diaries of the treatment period (diaries 2–4) and of
the follow-up period (diaries 5–10). Each diary covered 4 weeks.

Real acupuncture treatment

Primary efﬁcacy parameters

1 The treatment was semi-standardized (see
Table 2). The chosen points were related to the
pain topography of the most frequent migraine
attacks in each patient and based on some principles of traditional Chinese medicine.
2 From 6 to 10 points were used in each session (12–
20 needles were inserted).
3 Each patient had a ﬁxed treatment in their 16
sessions.
4 The needles were manipulated by rotation methods to produce a characteristic sensation known

descriptively and comparison between groups was
done, ascribing some statistical signiﬁcant difference
to some effects.

Patients were fully informed that two kinds of acupuncture would be done. One would be real and the
other would be false, placebo. No additional information was given.
At the end of the study, patients were invited to
ﬁll in a questionnaire evaluating the acupuncture
treatment and to give their impression about which
treatment group (real or sham acupuncture) they
thought they had been included in.

Statistical analysis
The sample size was determined considering the
results shown in an unpublished pilot trial that had
been done before this present trial. The endpoint
considered to calculate this sample was the percentage of patients with reduction of ≥40% in their
migraine attacks in the second month of treatment
with sham or real acupuncture. The equivalence
range was 11.8–57.9% for patients with a reduction
of the attack rate of 40% and with α = 0.05 and
β = 0.20. The number of patients required was 26
divided into two groups. As a drop-out rate of 15%
was expected, 30 patients had to be enrolled into the
study.
Statistical comparisons were done using univariate analysis with the χ2 test and Fisher’s exact test.
Analysis of variance (Anova) for repeated measures
was used to compare both groups. Comparisons
within groups for the migraine parameters in each
one of the periods were done using the Tukey’s posthoc test. Differences within each group were
estimated using the proﬁle test by contrasts. The
signiﬁcant level used for the statistical analysis was
5%, therefore P < 0.05 indicates signiﬁcance.

Results
Patients
The selection of patients for the trial took place from
August 2002 to March 2003. The follow-up period
was from July 2003 to February 2004. Thirty-one
migraine sufferers were enrolled in the study. They
were randomly assigned to the real (16 patients) and
sham acupuncture (15 patients) groups. However,
only 28 patients completed the treatment and they

were included in the statistical analysis. The ﬂow
of participants through each stage of the trial is
presented in Fig. 1. There was no signiﬁcant difference between study completers and drop-outs in
diary scores, group of treatment, age or headache
characteristics.
The groups’ demographic data are presented in
Table 3. There was only one statistically signiﬁcant
difference between groups, the age mean. The
patients in the sham acupuncture group were older
than in the real acupuncture group (P = 0.024).

Efﬁcacy and long-term follow-up (24 weeks)
No statistically signiﬁcant difference between
groups was observed in any pain parameter evaluated in this trial. Nevertheless, comparisons within
each group found that all migraine pain parameters
had improved with statistically signiﬁcant differences in both groups. There was one exception:
headache severity when the patients were experiencing pain.

Associated symptoms
The Tukey test showed that the real acupuncture
group had signiﬁcantly reduced nausea during the
follow-up period when compared with the sham
acupuncture group (F(9,198) = 2.09; P = 0.0372). The
variance analysis showed that the variability in the
graph lines is not attributable to chance.
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference
between groups regarding the number and frequency of vomiting during attacks.

Rescue medication
No statistically signiﬁcant difference appeared
between groups or within each group.

526

well as in local nodules (P = 0.008) and local pain
after sessions (P = 0.002).

Treatment impressions
All patients announced their intention to be treated
with acupuncture in future. When they were asked
how they would classify the treatment, patients who
received real acupuncture classiﬁed it as good
(28.6%), very good (42.8%) and excellent (28.6%).
Patients who were in the sham acupuncture group
rated it as regular (14.3%), good (35.7%) and very
good (50%). In the sham acupuncture group nobody
classiﬁed the treatment as excellent. Likewise, in the
real acupuncture group, every patient qualiﬁed the
treatment as good although there was no statistically
signiﬁcant difference between groups.
When they were asked about the kind of treatment
that they received, patients in the real acupuncture
group answered: ‘real treatment’ (28.7%), ‘placebo
acupuncture’ (7%) and ‘I don’t know’ (64.3%). In the
sham acupuncture group, they answered: ‘real treatment’ (28.6%) and ‘I don’t know’ (71.4%). There
was no signiﬁcant statistical difference between the
replies from the two groups, indicating that the
blinding (keeping the patients unaware of their
treatment) was successful.

Discussion
Only one statistically signiﬁcant difference appeared
between groups in demographics characteristics (see

Table 3). The age of the patients selected to the real
acupuncture group varied from 22 to 50 (mean 32.50)
and in the sham acupuncture group from 23 to 49
(mean 39.14). Despite sparse longitudinal prospective epidemiological data and information about the
prognosis and natural history of migraine (22, 23),
authors considered that this difference did not inﬂuence the results. Also, in the present trial the age
span for patient selection was not large (18–50 years
old). Therefore, no statistical correction for age was
applied.

Efﬁcacy
There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences
between the real and the sham acupuncture groups
in any pain parameters evaluated in this trial during
the treatment or follow-up periods, such as: percentage of patients with reduction ≥40% and ≥50% in
migraine attack frequency, total migraine days,
frequency of migraine attacks, mean duration of a
migraine attack, mean headache severity and total
duration of migraine pain in hours per diary (see
Figs 2, 3 and 4). No differences were observed
between groups in the rate of rescue medication
used or frequency of nausea and vomiting. These
results are in accordance with three sham-controlled
trials testing the efﬁcacy of acupuncture in treating
migraine (24–26).
Improvement within each group could be
observed during the treatment up to 20 weeks after
the last acupuncture session (most of the follow-up

period) in almost all pain parameters evaluated,
with the exception of pain intensity during the
migraine attack. Although several trials testing acupuncture or drugs showed improvement of the
frequency of migraine attacks, the same was not veriﬁed for headache severity (10, 11, 27–31).
It is widely known that:
1 The placebo effects are higher in pain sufferers
than in patients suffering from other complaints
(32).
2 Invasive technical proceedings have higher analgesic effects than oral drugs (2, 33, 34).
3 The majority of acupuncture trials that tested
the efﬁcacy of acupuncture in pain conditions had
identiﬁed that sham acupuncture could result in a
positive response, reducing the possibility of identifying statistically signiﬁcant differences between
real and sham acupuncture (2, 4, 5, 7, 15, 35).
Therefore, the improvement achieved for both
groups (real and sham) could be a result of the combination of the three factors referred to above more
than the speciﬁc effects of the needling. The nonspeciﬁc effects depend on the patients’ beliefs, such
as: the magic effects of the eastern techniques in the
western patient’s mind, the patients’ beliefs that they
are being treated, the acupuncture consultation, the
practioners’ expectations of acupuncture effects and
the general results of needle insertion (15, 25, 36).
Another point should be highlighted: the
improvement rate reached for both acupuncture

groups in the present trial was below that of two
previous high-quality trials (9, 25). It could be determined by several factors: chance, bias, the sort of
semi-standardized acupuncture chosen by medical
acupuncturists, the small size of the sample, or large
variability of the results observed in both groups. It
is important to recall that the patients were aware
that the placebo acupuncture treatment was being
applied. It is known that in pain studies the response
to an active drug is lower in placebo-controlled trials
than in open trials or in trials when patients were
informed that they would receive only active
treatments (32).
Persistence of the improvement lasted up to
24 weeks after the period of treatment (approximately 6 months) in both groups, in accordance with
the long-lasting acupuncture effects related previously in three well-designed clinical trials (8, 25, 37).
Guidelines and an article containing methodological
suggestions for trials in acupuncture also suggested
it (4, 15).
The number of days with nausea decreased
slightly in the real acupuncture group from the ﬁrst
month of treatment up to the ﬁfth month of the follow-up period, contrasting with the increase of the
same variable in the sham acupuncture group. There
was a statistically signiﬁcant difference between
them from the third to the ﬁfth month of the followup period and the variance analysis did not attribute
this result to chance. Nevertheless, the rate of rescue
medication used and vomiting in both groups did
not change in any phase of the trial.

Effects such as: local nodule (P = 0.008) and local
pain after session (P = 0.002) appeared with a statistically signiﬁcant difference in the real acupuncture
group, which is understandable because the depth
of needle insertion was very superﬁcial in the sham
group. In the real group, damage of superﬁcial vessels and nerves is more likely. Sleepiness was significantly more frequent in the real acupuncture group
(P = 0.008) and this is also attributable to the depth
of needle insertion.

Limitations
Selection of patients was difﬁcult because of the very
strict inclusion and exclusion criteria adopted in this
trial, which followed all suggestions presented in
two guides: Guidelines for controlled trials of drugs
in migraine (13), edited by the IHS, and Guidelines
for Clinical Research on Acupuncture (15), edited by

the WHO. Most of the volunteers for the trial were
eliminated because they had other kinds of headache, mainly chronic daily headache.
The treatment adopted in the real acupuncture
group (the semi-standardized treatment) was based
on the experience of three medical doctors who have
worked with acupuncture from 14 to 20 years. The
treatment protocol was based on the topography of
the headache related to the theory of traditional
Chinese medicine. Therefore, our therapeutic
scheme would not be the widespread treatment
applied for acupuncturists. In fact, acupuncture
practice is very different between acupuncturists
throughout the world. The advantage of the semistandardized treatment is that it could easily be
reproduced in future trials, had the results been positive. In fact, acupuncturists know that there is a gap
between their practice and what has been done in
research. It is a common criticism when acupuncturists and some researchers comment on the scientiﬁc approach to the evaluation of acupuncture
effectiveness (2, 4, 9).

Conclusion
The aim of the present trial was to verify the efﬁcacy
of the semi-standardized acupuncture treatment in
migraine prophylaxis. All pain parameters evaluated showed that this approach is not better than
sham acupuncture to prevent attacks in migraine
sufferers. Results of a previous trial (pilot study) not
yet published, where authors used the individualized treatment in the real acupuncture group, seem
to offer the best approach. It takes into account all
clinical signs and symptoms presented by each
patient. However, it is a complex therapeutic scheme
and difﬁcult to reproduce.
