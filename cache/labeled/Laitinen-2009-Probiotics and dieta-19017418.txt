Balanced glucose metabolism ensures optimal fetal growth with long-term health implications conferred on both mother and child. We examined
whether supplementation of probiotics with dietary counselling affects glucose metabolism in normoglycaemic pregnant women. At the ﬁrst
trimester of pregnancy <n>256</n> women were randomised to receive nutrition counselling to modify dietary intake according to current recommendations or as controls; the dietary intervention group was further randomised to receive probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Biﬁdobacterium lactis Bb12; diet/probiotics) or placebo (diet/placebo) in a double-blind manner, whilst the control group received placebo (control/
placebo). Blood glucose concentrations were lowest in the diet/probiotics group during pregnancy (baseline-adjusted means 4·45, 4·60 and
4·56 mmol/l in diet/probiotics, diet/placebo and control/placebo, respectively; P¼ 0·025) and over the 12 months’ postpartum period (baselineadjusted means 4·87, 5·01 and 5·02 mmol/l; P¼ 0·025). Better glucose tolerance in the diet/probiotics group was conﬁrmed by a reduced risk
of elevated glucose concentration compared with the control/placebo group (OR 0·31 (95 % CI 0·12, 0·78); P¼ 0·013) as well as by the lowest
insulin concentration (adjusted means 7·55, 9·32 and 9·27 mU/l; P¼ 0·032) and homeostasis model assessment (adjusted means 1·49, 1·90 and
1·88; P¼ 0·028) and the highest quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (adjusted means 0·37, 0·35 and 0·35; P¼ 0·028) during the last trimester
of pregnancy. The effects observed extended over the 12-month postpartum period. The present study demonstrated that improved blood glucose
control can be achieved by dietary counselling with probiotics even in a normoglycaemic population and thus may provide potential novel means
for the prophylactic and therapeutic management of glucose disorders.
Probiotics: Dietary counselling: Glucose metabolism: Pregnancy

Early pregnancy is characterised by normal tolerance to
glucose and insulin. In late pregnancy, in contrast, an
increase is observed in the serum insulin concentration
accompanied by insulin resistance. These metabolic adaptations aim to promote fetal growth by shunting metabolic
fuels to the fetus instead of the mother, as well as preparation
for breast-feeding. In some pregnant women these adaptive
processes are exaggerated and lead to impaired glucose
tolerance. Such individuals are predisposed to gestational diabetes mellitus and consequently to type 2 diabetes(1). In the
case of the child, impaired maternal glycaemia predisposes
toward macrosomia(2) and impaired glucose tolerance(3),
which may develop even when maternal estimates are
within normal reference ranges, i.e. not classiﬁed as gestational diabetes mellitus(4). A higher-than-optimal glucose
level, now acknowledged to be more common than anticipated, may involve long-term effects not only on the
mother but also on the child(5 – 7). Indeed, the effects on the

infant of maternal nutrition during pregnancy may initiate a
cascade of metabolic and immunoinﬂammatory conditions
manifested in later life.
We chose a combined dietary counselling and probiotic
intervention to target maternal glucose metabolism, in view
of the importance to maintain normoglycaemia throughout
pregnancy. Previous dietary interventions with primarily
reduced energy and fat intakes as well as increased ﬁbre
intakes have resulted in improved glucose tolerance test
results(8). Recent experimental evidence, on the other hand,
points to a role for the gut microbiota composition in the
harvesting and storage of nutrients(9 – 11). The approach may
also be justiﬁed by the demonstration that diet and microbiota
may exert their effects via similar signalling pathways in
regulating immune responses(12 – 14). Immunoinﬂammatory
processes and prevailing systemic low-grade inﬂammation
may contribute to the metabolic conditions affecting glucose
metabolism(15). In a randomised clinical trial from early

pregnancy, 256 women were allocated to three groups: modiﬁcation of dietary intake according to current recommendations with probiotics or placebo and a control group
receiving placebo only. The women were followed clinically
and their glucose metabolism repeatedly evaluated from
early pregnancy up to 12 months postpartum.

Methods

British Journal of Nutrition

Participants
Altogether 256 pregnant women were recruited to participate
in a randomised, prospective, parallel-group, combined dietary
counselling and probiotics intervention study from April 2002
to November 2005 (NCT00167700; section 3, http://www.
clinicaltrials.gov). The overall aims of the study were to
optimise maternal dietary intake and metabolism to advance
maternal health and thus to reduce the risk of disease in the
child. The present report explores the impact of intervention
on maternal nutrition with the main focus on glucose metabolism. The subjects were informed about the study by leaﬂets
distributed during their ﬁrst visit to maternal welfare clinics in

Fig. 1. Flow chart of the study.

the city of Turku and neighbouring areas in South-West
Finland. Interested recipients contacted the research nurse,
who gave further information on the study and scheduled
their ﬁrst visit to the study clinic in Turku University Central
Hospital. Women were eligible for participation if they were at
less than 17 weeks’ gestation and had no metabolic or chronic
diseases such as diabetes. The study complies with the
Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000. Written informed
consent was obtained from the participants and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital
District of South-West Finland.
Intervention and study conduct
Study visits took place three times during pregnancy (at 13·9
(SD 1·6), 23·8 (SD 1·4) and 33·9 (SD 1·4) weeks of gestation)
and at 1, 6 and 12 months postpartum. At baseline, subjects
were randomly assigned to three study groups (Fig. 1) according to computer-generated block randomisation of six women:
dietary counselling with probiotic capsules (diet/probiotics);
dietary counselling with placebo (diet/placebo); controls (control/placebo). The randomisation list was generated by a

British Journal of Nutrition

Probiotics, diet and blood glucose

statistician (T. P.) who was not involved in recruitment or
study visits. Sealed envelopes contained subject numbers corresponding to numbered probiotics and placebo containers and
information on whether the subject would receive dietary
counselling. All pregnant women participating in the study
also attended communal well-women clinics.
At the ﬁrst study visit the envelopes were opened by the
research nurse and nutritionist in the presence of each study
subject in their order of recruitment. The random allocation
sequence was thus concealed until interventions were
assigned. Research nurses and researchers ensured that capsules with corresponding numbers were given to the subjects
and that appropriate dietary counselling intervention was carried out. The capsule containers were numbered according to
the randomisation list by a member of the research group not
involved with the conduct or reporting of the study. The trial
data were collected on printed case record forms and the members of the research group performed data entry. All data were
kept conﬁdential.
Randomisation to receive probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, ATCC 53 103, Valio Ltd, Helsinki, Finland and Biﬁdobacterium lactis Bb12, Chr. Hansen, Hoersholm, Denmark,
1010 colony-forming units/d each) or placebo (microcrystalline
cellulose and dextrose anhydrate; Chr. Hansen, Hoersholm,
Denmark) in the dietary counselling groups took place in a
double-blind manner, while the control group received
placebo in single-blind manner (Fig. 1). The choice of the
probiotic combination was based on in vitro results(16),
and previous clinical intervention studies suggesting that L.
rhamnosus GG promotes a biﬁdogenic microbiota and biﬁdobacteria dominate the microbiota of healthy breast-fed
infants(17,18), with high biﬁdobacteria levels linked to the
risk of allergy(19). Probiotics and placebo capsules and contents looked, smelled and tasted identical. Dosing with standard content capsules commenced at the ﬁrst study visit and
lasted until the end of exclusive breast-feeding. All capsules
were stored at þ 58C and the viability of the probiotic capsules was conﬁrmed by regular analysis of blind in the laboratory under Professor S. Salminen. Compliance in consumption
of study capsules was assessed by interview.
Dietary counselling given by a dietitian at each study visit
aimed to modify dietary intake to conform with that currently
recommended(20,21), particular attention being paid to the
quality of dietary fat. Achievement of the recommended diet
was supported by providing participants with readily available
food products of favourable fat composition (for example,
rapeseed oil-based spreads and salad dressing) to be consumed
at home. The counselling and food products provided have
been described in detail elsewhere(22). Dietary intake was
assessed at each trimester using 3 d food diaries. Energy and
nutrient intakes were calculated with a Micro-Nutricaw computerised program (version 2.5; Research Centre of the Social
Insurance Institution, Turku, Finland).
At baseline, background information concerning education
and parity was collected by interview. Total gestational
weight gain was calculated by subtracting self-reported prepregnancy weight from that recorded at a prenatal visit or at
hospital within 1 week before delivery. Information regarding
children’s birth weights and heights and the course of pregnancy was obtained from hospital records. On the morning
of each visit, a 10 h overnight fasting blood sample was

1681

drawn from the antecubital vein for the analysis of glucose
and glycated Hb A1C on the day of sampling, whilst serum
was stored at 2 70 8C for the group analysis of insulin.
Analytical methods
On the day of sampling, plasma glucose concentration was
measured by an enzymic method utilising hexokinase in a
Modular P800 automatic analyser (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannhein, Germany) and blood glycated Hb A1C
was measured by ion-exchange HPLC by the Bio-Rad VariantTM II Haemoglobin A1C Program (Bio-Rad Laboratorioes,
Marnes-la-Coquette, France). Serum insulin concentration was
measured by immunoelectrochemiluminometric assay in a
Modular E170 automatic analyser (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH). To evaluate insulin sensitivity, the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was calculated as
described by Katz et al. (23). Homeostasis model assessment
(HOMA) was calculated using a formula devised by Matthews
et al. (24). All personnel who handled or analysed blood
samples were blind to the intervention. Glucose challenge
screening tests were taken from those performed in wellwomen clinics at 26 to 28 weeks of gestation according to
standard procedures for women fulﬁlling the criteria for atrisk pregnancy: pre-pregnancy BMI over 25 kg/m2; age over
40 years; gestational diabetes mellitus in a previous pregnancy; previous delivery of a child weighing more than
4500 g; detection of glucose in the urine or suspicion of a
macrosomic fetus in the present pregnancy.
Plasma glucose concentrations above 4·8 mmol/l during
pregnancy and 5·6 mmol/l in the non-pregnant state, the
percentage of glycated Hb in total Hb above 6·5 % and a
serum insulin concentration above 26 mU/l were considered
raised. Results of the glucose challenge tests were considered
pathological if an increased fasting glucose value (4·8 mmol/l)
was combined with at least one abnormal post-glucose
measurement (blood glucose . 10·0 mmol/l at 1 h or
.8·7 mmol/l at 2 h) according to reference values in Turku
University Central Laboratories. A higher QUICKI and
lower HOMA were taken to indicate better insulin sensitivity
in comparison of differences amongst the groups.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure to explore the effects of intervention on the mother was glucose metabolism, characterised
by plasma glucose concentration, blood glycated Hb A1C,
serum insulin and HOMA and QUICKI indices. The measurements were made at the ﬁrst trimester (baseline) and third trimester of pregnancy, and at 1, 6 and 12 months postpartum,
the primary time points being the third trimester of pregnancy
and 12 months postpartum. Secondary outcomes were dietary
energy-yielding nutrients assessed from food diaries, which
were analysed to explain changes in glucose metabolism.
Statistical analyses
Data were analysed with SPSS (version 14.0; SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) by a statistician (T. P.) independent of
clinical evaluations. The primary sample size calculations
were based on infant sensitisation assessed by skin prick

testing at the age of 12 months. We estimated that the required
sample size for analyses of glucose metabolism was sixty-six
per group to detect a difference in blood glucose of
0·20 mmol/l between groups statistically signiﬁcant with a
0·05 two-sided signiﬁcance level and 90 % power. We
assumed the common SD to be 0·35. Thus the same ﬁxed
sample size ensured that the power was sufﬁcient also for analyses of glucose metabolism.
The baseline and clinical variables were analysed using the
x2 test, ANOVA or the Kruskal –Wallis test (5 min Apgar).
Missing values for glucose metabolism (at most one during
pregnancy and one during the postpartum period) were computed using the group mean or geometric mean, as linear
extrapolation or interpolation methods were not appropriate
due to the substantial inherent non-linear within-subject
ﬂuctuation. Serum insulin and HOMA were skewed to the
right and were logarithmically transformed before analysis.
Comparison of glucose metabolism between the three study
groups at the third trimester of pregnancy or at 12 months
postpartum was made by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
and that in the postpartum period (1, 6 and 12 months) was
analysed using ANCOVA for repeated measurements. In
both cases the baseline was included as a continuous covariate. The results are given as baseline-adjusted means or geometric means with 95 % CI or standard deviations. Paired
group comparisons were Bonferroni-adjusted. The proportions
of subjects with elevated glucose concentrations ($ 4·8 mmol/l
during pregnancy, $ 5·6 mmol/l postpartum) were compared
between the study groups using the x2 test. Results of group
comparisons are given as OR with 95 % CI. For dietary
intake the study groups were compared at the third trimester,
during the postpartum period and at 12 months postpartum
using the same methods as described for glucose metabolism.
The analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population, apart from the twenty-three women who were pregnant
again by the end of the follow-up of 12 months and were
excluded, a new pregnancy being considered to be a strong
confounder.

Results
The participants (Table 1) were Caucasian. The majority had
higher college or university education (79 % in the diet/probiotics, 69 % in the diet/placebo and 79 % in the control/placebo
groups; P¼0·210) and were expecting their ﬁrst child (65 % in
the diet/probiotics, 51 % in the diet/placebo and 57 % in the control/placebo groups; P¼ 0·197). The infants were delivered at
term and their mean heights and weights were within population
reference ranges (Table 1). The mean duration of exclusive
breast-feeding and thus the duration of the probiotics/placebo
intervention did not differ amongst the study groups, nor
did the groups diverge with regard to pregnancy weight gain.
Of the total participating women, 99·5 % (216 out of 217),
99 % (209 out of 212) and 95 % (195 out of 205) at the second,
third and fourth study visit, respectively, reported without signiﬁcant difference between groups that they consumed the capsules regularly daily. An adverse event was not the reason for
non-compliance in any case. On initiation of capsule consumption 7 % (ﬁve out of seventy-three) of the women in the diet/probiotics group, 8 % (six out of seventy-ﬁve) in the diet/placebo
group, 3 % (two out of sixty-nine) in the control/placebo group
and 6 % (thirteen out of 217) in all three groups together reported
gut-associated adverse events including ﬂatulence, loose stools
or constipation. Subsequently the prevalence of reported symptoms was reduced to 2 % and 0·5 % at subsequent study visits.
Of the recruited women, 81 % (208 out of 256) were followed up till 12 months postpartum (Fig. 1). The reasons for
discontinuing were representative of a normal population of
pregnant women. Additionally, twenty-three women were
pregnant again by the end of the follow-up and were excluded
from the postpartum analysis.
Although energy intakes did not differ amongst the groups,
dietary counselling resulted in changes in the intakes of
energy-yielding nutrients compared with controls (Table 2).
Particularly the intakes of MUFA and PUFA as a proportion
of energy intake were highest in the diet/placebo group; thus,
the intake of SFA as a proportion of energy intake was lowest

time-point were included in the analysis. Bonferroni-corrected group comparisons for diet/probiotics v. diet/placebo and diet/probiotics v. control/placebo
were P¼0·026 and P¼0·165 for the third trimester, P¼0·054 and P¼0·878
for 12 months postpartum, and P¼0·066 and P¼0·048 for over the postpartum period, respectively. The inset shows the proportion (%) of abnormal

in both intervention groups compared with controls. At the same
time the intakes of energy-yielding nutrients among women
receiving probiotics (diet/probiotics) and placebo (diet/placebo)
did not differ. This allowed comparisons of the effect of
the probiotics according to the study design, except for that of
the intake of protein as a proportion of energy intake, this
being lowest in the diet/probiotics group at the third trimester
of pregnancy, but not during the postpartum period.

Impact of the intervention on glucose metabolism
Glucose concentrations decreased from the ﬁrst trimester to
the third and increased during the 12 months’ postpartum
period in all study groups alike (Fig. 2). The levels were
lowest in the diet/probiotics group throughout the follow-up
period and thus results are presented adjusted for baseline, i.e.
any differences before randomisation cannot explain the outcome. The difference between the study groups was signiﬁcant
during pregnancy, when the baseline-adjusted means were
4·45, 4·60 and 4·56 mmol/l in the diet/probiotics, diet/placebo
and control/placebo groups, respectively (P¼0·025). The same
was noted at 12 months after delivery (adjusted means 4·93, 5·22
and 5·06 mmol/l; P¼0·060) and over the 12-month postpartum
period (adjusted means 4·87, 5·01 and 5·02 mmol/l; P¼0·025).
The diet/probiotics group was distinguishable from the diet/placebo group at the third trimester of pregnancy (P¼0·026), at 12months postpartum (P¼0·054) and over the entire postpartum

period (P¼0·066), and further, from the control/placebo group
over the postpartum period (P¼0·048).
Although in these healthy pregnant women, the mean plasma
glucose concentrations were within normal reference ranges in
all study groups, the risk of elevated concentrations was reduced
in the diet/probiotics group throughout the study period
(Fig. 2, inset). During the third trimester, the diet/probiotics
intervention (OR 0·31 (95 % CI 0·12, 0·78); P¼0·013), unlike
the diet/placebo intervention (OR 1·26 (95 % CI 0·59, 2·69);
P¼0·553), had the capacity to reduce the risk of elevated
plasma glucose concentrations compared with the control/placebo treatment. In sequence, over the postpartum period the
risk of elevated plasma glucose concentrations remained lower
in the diet/probiotics group, albeit not statistically signiﬁcantly
(OR 0·46 (95 % CI 0·14, 1·50); P¼0·197), but not in the diet/placebo group (OR 1·55 (95 % CI 0·61, 3·95); P¼0·360), both compared with the control/placebo group.
Altogether 45 % of the subjects underwent a glucose
challenge test in well-women clinics during pregnancy.
The prevalence of pathological test results was lowest in the
diet/probiotics group (37 % of subjects) compared with the
diet/placebo (58 %) and control/placebo (57 %) groups.
However, the relative risk was not statistically signiﬁcantly
lowered (OR 0·44 (95 % CI 0·14, 1·38) in the diet/probiotics
group and OR 1·03 (95 % CI 0·41, 2·61) in the diet/placebo
group compared with the control/placebo group).
Glycated Hb A1C remained within normal ranges throughout the study and was comparable amongst the study groups
at the third trimester of pregnancy and at 12 months
postpartum, but there was a tendency towards lowered glycated Hb A1C in the diet/probiotics group compared with the
diet/placebo group over the postpartum period (Table 3).
Impact of the intervention on serum insulin and insulin
sensitivity indices
Insulin concentrations as well as insulin resistance, evaluated
by the HOMA index, were increased and insulin sensitivity,
evaluated by the QUICKI index, was reduced towards the
third trimester of pregnancy in all groups. The opposite was
noted after delivery, insulin concentration and HOMA index
being reduced and QUICKI index increased. Mean serum
insulin concentrations, insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity were found to differ amongst the groups throughout
the study period (Table 3). This difference, at the third trimester of pregnancy and over the postpartum period, was
explained by the lowering effect on serum insulin of the combined dietary and probiotics intervention (diet/probiotics
group), which was especially pronounced when compared
with controls (control/placebo group). The HOMA index
was lowest and QUICKI index highest, indicating improved
insulin sensitivity in the diet/probiotics group.
Discussion
Balanced glucose metabolism during pregnancy reduces
the risk of pregnancy-related complications(25) and confers
long-term health beneﬁts on both the mother and the
child(3,26). In the present study, throughout the study period,
combined dietary counselling and probiotics intervention
yielded consistently improved glucose metabolism and

insulin sensitivity in healthy women, providing the ﬁrst clinical evidence of an active dialogue between host and
microbiota in glucose metabolism. These results in a general
normoglycaemic population call for further research in at-risk
populations.
Combined dietary counselling and probiotic intervention
with L. rhamnosus GG and B. lactis Bb12 moderated
plasma glucose concentrations and afforded glycaemic control
in healthy young females during and after pregnancy. Previous
evidence regarding the effects of probiotics on glucose metabolism has been limited to experimental studies, speciﬁcally in
mice with existing alterations in glucose metabolism. A diet
enriched with L. rhamnosus GG has resulted in improved glucose tolerance test results as well as in reduced blood glycated
Hb(27) and L. casei administration in reduced glucose levels(28)
in diabetic mice. Likewise the Indian fermented milk product
dahi supplemented with L. acidophilus and L. casei (29) or
Lactococcus lactis (30) delayed the disturbance of glucose
metabolism in diabetic rats. The present study, indeed,
provided the ﬁrst evidence of consistently improved glucose
metabolism in humans. The impact of the intervention
extended several months beyond the period of probiotic

consumption, which has also been shown in other clinical
studies, for example, the effect of probiotic intervention
lasting for up to 7 years in reducing the risk of atopic
eczema(31). This is probably due to a relatively long duration
of probiotic consumption, from early pregnancy until the end
of exclusive breast-feeding, and occurring in the critical
period of the maturing infant, thus inducing an enduring
small change in intestinal microbiota composition, sufﬁcient
to stimulate the metabolic change observed in blood glucose
metabolism.
The microbes may impact on the glucose metabolism by
processing dietary polysaccharides, indigestible by human
enzymes, adding to the pool of gastrointestinal absorbable glucose(9). The gut microbiota may also enhance glucose storage
in adipose tissue by suppressing the fasting-induced adipocyte
factor gene transcription with ensuing enhanced lipoprotein
lipase activity(9). Thus, as a consequence of probiotic
consumption, a less saccharolytic microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract may diminish both fermentation of polysaccharides and induction of fasting-induced adipocyte factor gene
transcription. In addition to the effects seen as lowered
blood glucose levels in our study, it has been recently reported

British Journal of Nutrition

that differences in the gut microbiota content may predict
overweight in children, biﬁdobacterial content and composition being determinants of normal weight(32). Fermentation
of dietary ﬁbre in the gastrointestinal tract is known to be
associated with improved glucose metabolism(33), but is not
a likely explanatory factor here since dietary intake of ﬁbre
did not differ in women having received probiotics or not.
Alternatively, the mechanism may be independent of energy
harvest and storage as shown by resistance to diet-induced
obesity and glucose intolerance(11,34).
We suggest that the observed pronounced effect of probiotics
on glucose metabolism is most probably attributable to their
immunoregulatory properties. Probiotics elicit powerful antiinﬂammatory capabilities by inhibiting the NF-kB pathway,
which mediates microbial activation of the immune system
through toll-like receptors(35). Regulation of inﬂammatory pathways by probiotics may be of particular importance due to the
fundamental involvement that inﬂammation plays in insulin
resistance(15). The concomitance of elevated blood glucose concentrations, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia with activation
of inﬂammation pathways(35) is related to an enhanced risk of a
range of metabolic disorders, including obesity and CVD(36,37).
Indeed, alterations in gut microbiota composition have recently
been documented in obesity, providing a target for probiotic
intervention(10,32,38). Here we need to acknowledge that speciﬁc
probiotic strains may inﬂuence the microbiota composition in a
manner favouring lower circulating lipopolysaccharide levels,
possibly ensuing via the CD14 receptor(39), that associate with
lower insulin resistance and blood glucose levels(40,41). Thus a
universal presence of microbes or microbiota per se, may not
be crucial in determining glucose-regulating effects but rather
speciﬁc compositions may form the key factors.
Intriguingly, probiotics were shown here to provide a more
profound glucose-lowering effect than dietary counselling
alone. This notwithstanding, the impact of dietary counselling,
focused on fat composition(22), is most probably also afforded
by the speciﬁc regulatory properties of fats, beyond their
nutritional value(42). In fact, the microbes and fatty acids
engage the same signalling channels through toll-like receptor
4(35) and soluble CD14(14) of innate immunity. The innate
immune system, again, apart from microbial recognition, has
been demonstrated to participate in the regulation of glucose
metabolism and insulin resistance(35). Furthermore the composition of the gut microbiota has recently been proven instrumental in energy metabolism. High-fat feeding is associated
with lower intestinal Biﬁdobacterium content in mice, and
increase in Biﬁdobacterium content positively correlated
with improved glucose tolerance(39). It may be projected that
the clinical effects are under the same regulatory mechanisms.
Thus the present study calls for the precise characterisation of
the mechanisms involved in the combined regulatory properties of probiotics and speciﬁc dietary compounds.
Modiﬁcation of gut microbiota composition by probiotics,
thereby altering the intestinal immunological milieu, may be
seen as a novel means of attaining regulation of glucose
metabolism. This dietary approach would offer a cost-effective tool for both prophylaxis and therapy in the metabolic disorders that constitute the metabolic syndrome. The beneﬁt is
expected to be most pronounced during the critical period
of human development in view of the programming of later
diseases by events in the uterus(5).
