Aims: A prospective randomized study was conducted to evaluate the beneﬁt of adjuvant levamisole/UFT (futraful
and uracil) chemotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Methods: <n>Sixty-ﬁve</n> patients with stage III and IV squamous cell carcinomas of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx
and larynx with no distant metastasis were randomized for the chemotherapy study. Thirty-one patients were
randomized for chemotherapy and two of them were subsequently excluded. In this study, a total of 29 patients on
levamisole/UFT therapy and 34 patients on the control group were analysed. The main outcome was measured by
the 5-year disease-free actuarial survival rate.
Results: The rates of distant metastasis were 10% for chemotherapy group and 32% for control group (P=0.06).
The 5-year disease-free actuarial survival rates for patients with and without adjuvant chemotherapy were 57% and
39% respectively (P=0.207).
Conclusions: A trend of better distant control in head and neck cancer patients with post-operative adjuvant oral
chemotherapy was observed. The side effects were minimal. However, there was no statistically signiﬁcant improvement
in the overall long-term survival. It may be of value to conduct a large-scale multi-centre prospective randomized
study to verify the efﬁcacy of levamisole and UFT as post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy for the control of distant
metastasis in high-risk population.

INTRODUCTION
UFT (futraful and uracil) is a tumour-selective antineoplastic drug commonly used in breast, stomach,
colorectal and urinary bladder cancers. Experiments in
animal model and clinical studies demonstrate its selective
and broad-spectrum antineoplastic effect. UFT is
composed of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-ﬂuorouracil (futraful) and uracil in a molar ratio of 1:4. Futraful is a
prodrug of ﬂuorouracil (5-FU). It becomes effective after
hydroxylation and conversion to 5-FU by hepatic
microsomal enzymes. Uracil is natural pyrimidine, which
is readily taken up into tumour cells. It inhibits the
catabolism of 5-FU and potentiates the antitumour
activity of futraful.1 This accounts for the selective
antitumour activity of UFT. The concentrations of both

futraful and UFT are higher in tumour tissue than in
normal tissue, which make UFT an ideal anticancer agent.2
Various phase II trials show that oral UFT is effective
against head and neck cancers. Tumours of different
primary sites including paranasal sinuses, oral cavity,
oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx were found to have
either complete or partial responses to adjuvant oral
UFT chemotherapy. Levamisole is well known for its
antihelminthic and immunomodulatory activities. It acts
effectively with 5-FU as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage
III colorectal carcinoma. It is also shown to be effective,
with oral UFT, in the treatment of metastatic colorectal
carcinoma.3,4
There is no prospective randomized clinical trial to
evaluate the effect of the combination of oral UFT and
levamisole in head and neck cancers. The aim of the
present prospective randomized study is to evaluate
the therapeutic efﬁcacy of levamisole and UFT in postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for squamous cell
carcinomas of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and
larynx.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this prospective randomized study, patients who
presented at the Department of Surgery, The University
of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, with stage III and
IV squamous cell carcinomas of oral cavity, oropharynx,
hypopharynx and larynx with no distant metastasis were
recruited. Surgical resection was part of the management
protocol. Patients not ﬁt for surgery due to inoperable
diseases or associated medical problems were excluded.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong.
The sample size was estimated to be 65 cases, according
to the tumour response rate to UFT in phase II trials of
head and neck cancers5–9 and the survival beneﬁt of
levamisole/ﬂuorouracil in colorectal cancer10 ( -value=
0.05 and -value=0.2). From 1993 to 1995, 65 patients
with stage III and IV tumours of oral cavity, oropharynx,
hypopharynx and larynx with no distant metastasis were
recruited and randomized by drawing sealed envelopes.
Stratiﬁed randomization was done according to tumour
site (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx),
stage (III, IV), and prior radiotherapy treatment (prior
radiotherapy, no prior radiotherapy). Two patients

randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy group were
excluded from present analysis after initial recruitment
because they died of surgical complication before
commencement of post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. In the remaining 63 patients, 29 patients had
post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy and 34 patients
were in the control group. There were 54 males and
nine females. Fifty patients had no pre-operative
treatment and 13 patients had prior radiotherapy. All
patients had stage III and IV diseases according to the
AJCC/UICC system. There were 33 stage III and 30
stage IV diseases. The chemotherapy group and the
control group were comparable in terms of age, sex,
primary tumour site, differentiation, tumour status, nodal
status and AJCC staging as shown in Table 1. The mean
and median duration of follow-up were 36.3 months and
30.3 months respectively.
All patients had curative surgical treatment. Patients
were randomized into two groups. One group was
treated with adjuvant UFT and levamisole. The other
group was the control arm without chemotherapy. Prior
to operation, patients in the chemotherapy group were
put on levamisole 50 mg thrice daily for 3 days repeated
every 2 weeks in case of postponement of surgery. After
surgery, chemotherapy was commenced in the third
week in order to avoid the potentially adverse effect of
adjuvant chemotherapy on wound healing. Each cycle
included levamisole 50 mg thrice daily from day 1 to day
3 and UFT 200 mg thrice daily from day 8 to day
14. The cycle was repeated every two weeks with
no treatment break and lasted for one year or until
recurrence. The main outcome assessment parameter
was the 5-year disease-free actuarial survival rate.

RESULTS
Of the 29 patients who received adjuvant oral chemotherapy, 17 cases ﬁnished the 1-year course of treatment

without discontinuation. Nine cases did not ﬁnish the
whole course of adjuvant chemotherapy owing to the
development of local, regional or distant recurrences.
Three discontinued after 4 months of treatment due to
vomiting and mucositis. One patient developed mild
gastric upset and continued the full course of treatment.
Other major side effects related to haematological
toxicity or nephrotoxicity were not observed.
The pattern of recurrence of the two groups was
shown in Table 2. There was no statistically signiﬁcant
difference in the rates of local and regional recurrences.
A trend of better distant control was observed but was
not statistically signiﬁcant (Chi-square test, P=0.06). The
mean time interval from the date of surgery to date of
distant metastasis was not statistically signiﬁcant between
the two arms (t-test, P=0.561).
The overall 5-year survival rate of the 67 patients was
47%. The 5-year survival rate of patients with and without
adjuvant levamisole/UFT were (Fig. 1) 57% and 39%
respectively (Kaplan–Meier method, log rank statistics,
P=0.207). The subgroup analysis of survival with respect
to different stages, differentiation and tumour sites were
all not statistically signiﬁcant (Kaplan–Meier method, log
rank statistics, all with P>0.1).

DISCUSSION
Studies showed that ﬂuorouracil plus levamisole as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy prolonged survival and
reduced the risk of recurrence in patients with stage III
(Dukes’ C) colorectal cancer.11–13 Tanaka et al. reported
a non-randomized single-arm study in which 37.2% of
43 head and neck cancer patients showed either complete
or partial response to oral UFT chemotherapy with
shrinkage in tumour size. There was however no
documentation of survival beneﬁt despite the positive
tumour response.5 Fujii et al. demonstrated in a retrospective review that UFT was effective as adjuvant oral
chemotherapy in maxillary sinus carcinoma with 5-year
survival rate improved from 22.6 to 76.6%.7 This was,
however, a retrospective review and the large difference
in survival was of doubtful scientiﬁc evidence. In view of
these positive preliminary reports of beneﬁt of UFT in
head and neck cancers, we initiated the present phase
III prospective randomized trial in 1993 in order to
resolve the question of survival beneﬁt.

Our study was the ﬁrst report of a prospective
randomized study on the use of oral levamisole/UFT in
squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity, oropharynx,
hypopharynx and larynx. A trend of better control of
distant metastasis was observed, from 32% for the
control group down to 10% for the chemotherapy group.
However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
local and regional failure rates. The 5-year survival rates
between the two arms were not signiﬁcantly different,
despite the encouraging results of basic scientiﬁc research
on the use of UFT in head and neck cancers. It disproved
the remarkable survival beneﬁt reported by Fujii et al.
on the use of adjuvant UFT in maxillary sinus cancer
patients.
The potential clinical beneﬁt of chemotherapy in the
treatment of distant metastasis was reported in clinical
studies and animal experiments. UFT was found to inhibit
the micrometastasis of malignant cells from different
origins in animal model.14–16 UFT was reported to achieve
2% complete response and 45% partial response in the
treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma at sites
including liver, lung and bone.3 Other chemotherapeutic
agents were also found to be useful in the treatment of
distant metastasis. Cisplatin was found to reduce distant
metastasis of head and neck cancer in a multi-institutional
prospective randomized trial in 462 head and neck cancer
patients, there was however no signiﬁcant improvement
in survival.17 Another prospective randomized study of
chemoradiotherapy using cisplatin/ﬂuorouracil was found
to reduce incidence of distant failure from 17% to 10%.18
The oral maintenance chemotherapy of levamisole and
UFT was well tolerated by the patients without signiﬁcant
side effects. Only three patients discontinued UFT
because of vomiting or mucositis. Thus oral levamisole/
UFT may be a useful alternative with beneﬁcial effect on
the control of distant failure of head and neck cancer, with
better drug tolerance, compliance and toxicity compared
with cisplatin based intravenous adjuvant chemotherapeutic agents.
In conclusion, a trend of better distant control was
observed in the adjuvant chemotherapy group. The side
effects were well tolerated. Nevertheless, there was no
proven survival beneﬁt for the use of levamisole and
UFT in head and neck cancers of oral cavity, oropharynx,
hypopharynx and larynx. Thus a large-scale multi-centre
prospective randomized trial may be required to evaluate
the efﬁcacy of these oral adjuvant chemotherapeutic
agents in head and neck cancer patients with high chance
of distant metastasis.
