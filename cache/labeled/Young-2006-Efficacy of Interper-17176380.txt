Efficacy of Interpersonal PsychotherapyAdolescent Skills Training: an indicated
preventive intervention for depression

Institute, USA

Background: Indicated interventions for adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms may help
decrease rates of depression. The current study reports on the efﬁcacy of Interpersonal PsychotherapyAdolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST), a group indicated preventive intervention. Methods: <n>Forty-one</n>
adolescents with elevated depression symptoms were randomized to receive either IPT-AST or school
counseling (SC) as delivered by guidance counselors and social workers. Adolescents in the two intervention conditions were compared on depression symptoms, overall functioning, and depression
diagnoses post-intervention and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Results: Adolescents who received IPT-AST had signiﬁcantly fewer depression symptoms and better overall functioning postintervention and at follow-up. Adolescents in IPT-AST also reported fewer depression diagnoses than
adolescents in usual care. Conclusions: These results provide preliminary evidence of the efﬁcacy of
IPT-AST as an intervention for adolescents with subthreshold depression. Future research is needed to
conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of IPT-AST in a larger and more diverse sample and to determine its long-term
impact on depression symptoms and depression diagnoses. Keywords: Prevention, depression, adolescence, psychotherapy.

Preventive interventions are classiﬁed as universal,
selective, and indicated (Gordon, 1983). Universal
interventions are provided to the entire population.
Selective interventions are provided to a subsample
with a known risk factor and indicated interventions
target individuals with subthreshold symptoms of a
disorder. Elevated depression symptoms are one of
the biggest risk factors for developing a depressive
disorder (Lewinsohn et al., 1994; Pine, Cohen, Cohen, & Brook, 1999). These symptoms are persistent
over time (Garrison, Jackson, Marsteller, McKeown,
& Addy, 1990) and are associated with considerable
psychosocial impairment (Gotlib, Lewinsohn, &
Seeley, 1995; Lewinsohn, Solomon, Seeley, & Zeiss,
2000). In recognition of the risk and impairment
associated with depressive symptoms, there has
been a call for an increase in indicated preventive
intervention research (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994; US
Public Health Service, 2000).
A number of universal (e.g., Clarke, Hawkins,
Murphy, & Sheeber, 1993; Petersen, Leffert, Graham, Alwin, & Ding, 1997; Shochet et al., 2001;
Spence, Shefﬁeld, & Donovan, 2003) and selective
interventions (e.g., Beardslee et al., 1997; Clarke
et al., 2001; Wolchik, West, Westover, & Sandler,
1993) have been tested for adolescent depression. To
date, two indicated interventions for adolescents

with elevated depressive symptoms have been studied. The Penn Prevention Program (Gillham & Reivich, 1999; Gillham, Reivich, Jaycox, & Seligman,
1995; Jaycox, Reivich, Gillham, & Seligman, 1994)
is a 12-week cognitive-behavioral group for children,
aged 10–13, with depressive symptoms and family
conﬂict. The intervention includes cognitive and social skills components. Children who received this
intervention demonstrated a reduction in depressive
symptoms post-intervention and up to 2 years postintervention. Later studies of this intervention have
been less consistent, ﬁnding effects for females but
not males (Freres, Gillham, Reivich, Shatte, & Se´
ligman, 2002), Latino children but not African
American children (Cardemil, Reivich, & Seligman,
2002). A replication study in Australia found no intervention effects for depression post-intervention or
at 6-month follow-up (Roberts, Kane, Thomson,
Bishop, & Hart, 2003).
Clarke and his colleagues (Clarke et al., 1995)
employed a 15 session group cognitive-behavioral
intervention (CBP) for 9th and 10th graders with
elevated symptoms. The intervention focuses on
modifying negative and irrational thoughts that may
contribute to depression. Fewer adolescents who
participated in CBP had depression diagnoses than
adolescents in the control group during the 12month follow-up period. These studies suggest that
preventive interventions targeting children and adolescents with subthreshold symptoms may be
effective in preventing future depressive symptoms
and depressive disorders. Additional preventive

interventions, particularly those based on other evidence-based treatments, may also be effective.
We report on an indicated prevention intervention,
Interpersonal
Psychotherapy-Adolescent
Skills
Training (IPT-AST), which is based on Interpersonal
Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-A;
Mufson, Dorta, Moreau, & Weissman, 2004a). We
chose to adapt IPT-A as a preventive intervention for
several reasons. First, IPT-A is an effective treatment
modality for adolescent depression (Mufson, Weissman, Moreau, & Garﬁnkel, 1999; Mufson et al.,
2004b; Rossello & Bernal, 1999). Second, IPT-A ad´
dresses interpersonal deﬁcits and conﬂicts, which
increase the risk for depression (e.g., Lewinsohn
et al., 1994; Reinherz et al., 1989), and promotes
skilled communication and positive relationships,
factors that protect against the development of
depression (Carbonell, Reinherz, & Giaconia, 1998).
By directly targeting these risk and protective factors, the development of depression may be prevented. Third, IPT-A emphasizes psychoeducation and
skill development, which are particularly relevant to
prevention.
This paper presents results from a randomized
trial comparing IPT-AST, a school-based group
intervention, to school counseling (SC) as provided
by school guidance counselors and social workers.
We hypothesize there will be a signiﬁcant difference
in depressive symptoms and overall functioning between subjects who participated in IPT-AST and
those who received SC at post-intervention, 3-month
follow-up, and 6-month follow-up. We also anticipate that there will be different rates of depression
disorders in the two intervention conditions.

Methods
Case-ﬁnding procedures
Adolescents with elevated symptoms of depression were
identiﬁed through a two-stage case-ﬁnding procedure
modeled after Clarke et al. (1995). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at
Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute. Figure 1 provides an overview of study recruitment.

Screening. The ﬁrst stage was a classroom-based
screening in 3 Catholic schools in New York City. Parents of students in the 7th–10th grades were sent a
letter about the screening from school administrators. If
the parents did not want their child to participate, they
sent back a notice of refusal. If we did not receive a
refusal for a particular student, a second letter was
sent. On the day of the screening, adolescents whose
parents refused participation were not approached for
the survey. All other adolescents were informed of the
procedures and were given the opportunity to refuse
participation. Those adolescents that wanted to participate signed a screening assent form.
Adolescents who assented to the screening completed
the self-report Center for Epidemiologic StudiesDepression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977). The CES-D

1255

has 20 items that assess depressive symptoms over the
past week. We used a version of the CES-D that
reworded 4 items to prevent the need for reverse scoring
to compute a total score. For instance, rather than the
item ‘I felt I was just as good as other people,’ this version had ‘I felt that I was not as good as other people.’
The adult literature recommends using a score of 16 or
higher as indicative of a depressive illness. Because a
cut-off of 16 leads to a number of false positives in
adolescent populations, people have recommended
various cut-off scores ranging from 12 to 24 (Garrison,
Addy, Jackson, McKeown, & Waller, 1991; Roberts,
Andrews, Lewinsohn, & Hops, 1990). We used the adult
criterion of a score equal to or greater than 16 to identify
as many adolescents as possible who may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Adolescents with a
CES-D score between 16 and 39 were eligible to be
approached for the prevention project; those with a
score of 40 or higher were referred out for treatment as a
requirement of the IRB.
The average CES-D score of the 365 adolescents
screened was 15.1 (SD ¼ 13.0); 112 adolescents
(30.7%) scored between 16 and 39. Research personnel
contacted the eligible adolescents and their parents to
describe the prevention project. Interested families
came to the school and met with study personnel to
hear more about the project and provide informed
consent and assent. Approximately half of the families
(55 or 49.1%) agreed to participate in the project. Four
adolescents were not offered the program because of
involvement in child protective services or the known
severity of their symptoms. Of the remaining 53 families, the most common reason for refusing participation
in the project was general disinterest (in 18.9% the
adolescent was not interested, in 22.6% the parent was
not interested, and in 20.8% the adolescent and parent
were not interested). Other reasons were: belief that the
adolescent did not need the prevention program
(22.6%); the parent’s desire to handle the problems
outside of school (9.4%); scheduling conﬂicts (3.8%);
and the adolescent not wanting to be randomized to a
group (1.9%).
The adolescents who consented to participate in the
prevention component of the project were compared to
those who did not participate on several key variables.
There were no signiﬁcant differences in screening CESD score (25.2 versus 25.0; tdf ¼ 110 ¼ ).11), age (13.5
versus 13.7; tdf ¼ 110 ¼ .76), or gender (85.4% female
versus 91.2% female; v2 ¼ 1 ¼ .91).

Diagnostic evaluation. Fifty-four of the 55 adolescents who consented to the project completed a structured diagnostic interview, the Schedule for Affective
Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children
(K-SADS-PL) (Kaufman, Birmaher, Brent, & Rao, 1997)
and the Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS)
(Shaffer et al., 1983), to determine eligibility. One
adolescent repeatedly failed to show for the eligibility
evaluation and was dropped from the project.
Adolescents were eligible to participate in the study if
they had at least 2 subthreshold or threshold depression symptoms on the K-SADS-PL and did not meet
criteria for a current depressive episode. Elevated depressed mood, irritability, or anhedonia was required,
as was a CGAS score of 61 or higher. Adolescents were

deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder. Three adolescents were
excluded because they did not have enough depression
symptoms; eight were excluded because they met criteria for one of the exclusionary diagnoses. In the ﬁrst
two months of recruitment, two additional adolescents
were excluded from the project because they had a past
depressive episode. This eligibility criterion was then
modiﬁed to allow adolescents with a past depressive
episode to participate in the intervention as previous
studies had done (e.g., Clarke et al., 1995). Seventeen
percent of the sample (N ¼ 7) was enrolled prior to this
change.

Randomization. Forty-one adolescents were randomly
assigned to receive IPT-AST or SC using a table of random numbers. To ensure enough IPT-AST groups, the
random number table was generated so that approximately two-thirds of adolescents would be randomized
to the IPT-AST condition. Twenty-seven adolescents
were randomized to IPT-AST and 14 adolescents were
randomized to SC.

Participants
Participants were aged 11 to 16 in the 7th–10th grades
at three Catholic schools (two coeducational middle
schools and one all-girls high school). The average age
was 13.4 (SD ¼ 1.2) years and the sample was 85.4%
female. The majority of the adolescents were Hispanic
(92.7%). Sixty-six percent of the sample lived in a single-parent household and half reported a gross household income of $25,000 or less. Several of the
adolescents met criteria for a current non-affective
DSM-IV diagnosis, but the majority (75.6%) had only
subthreshold depression symptoms with no current
diagnosis. Two adolescents had a past diagnosis of
dysthymia (one in each condition). There were no signiﬁcant differences on baseline demographic and clinical variables between the two intervention conditions.

Assessments
All adolescents completed assessments at baseline,
post-intervention, and 3 and 6 months post-intervention. Adolescents were given $15 for completing each
assessment. Each evaluation included the K-SADS-PL,
CGAS, and CES-D. Scores on the CES-D range from 0–
60, with higher scores indicating more symptoms. The
K-SADS-PL interviews were performed by a clinical
evaluator, a Masters-level psychologist who was blind
to treatment condition. A diagnosis of Depressive Disorder Not Otherwise Speciﬁed (DD NOS) was given
when an adolescent reported 3 or 4 threshold symptoms of depression, one of which was depressed mood,
irritability, or anhedonia. Following each evaluation
with an adolescent, the evaluator assigned a CGAS
score. Scores on the CGAS range from 0–100, with
higher scores indicating better functioning.
In addition to the assessments with the clinical
evaluator, each adolescent completed the CES-D midintervention to assess clinical status. Any adolescent
with a mid-intervention CES-D score of 40 or higher
would meet with the Principal Investigator to assess the
need for removal from the study. None of the adolescents had a mid-treatment CES-D that required further
attention. The post-intervention assessments were
scheduled after the last group session at each school
and occurred on average 12.6 weeks after randomization. The follow-up assessments occurred approximately 3 and 6 months after the post-intervention
assessments. If any assessment indicated a need for
additional treatment, the family was given a referral for
outside treatment. Two adolescents in SC received
psychotherapy during the follow-up period. Twelve
adolescents (7 in IPT-AST and 5 in SC) reported meeting
with the school counselor during the follow-up.

Interventions
IPT-AST. IPT-AST, known to the adolescents as ‘Teen
Talk,’ involves two initial individual sessions and eight
weekly 90-minute group sessions. The group focuses
on psychoeducation and general skill-building that
can be applied to different relationships within the
framework of three interpersonal problem areas:
interpersonal role disputes, role transitions, and
interpersonal deﬁcits. The psychoeducation component includes deﬁning prevention, educating members
about depression, and discussing the relationship
between feelings and interpersonal interactions. The
interpersonal skill-building component consists of two
stages. First, communication and interpersonal
strategies are taught through didactics, games, roleplays, and communication analysis. Once group
members understand the skills, they are asked to
apply them to different people in their lives, practicing
ﬁrst in group and then at home. IPT-AST is a modiﬁcation of the group IPT-A manual (Mufson, Gallagher, Dorta, & Young, 2004c). Primary modiﬁcations
were: decreasing the number of group sessions from
twelve to eight; adding activities to illustrate the link
between what we say and how others respond; and
teaching interpersonal techniques to group members
using ﬁctional scenarios before applying them to reallife situations.

All sessions took place in the schools. The individual
sessions occurred during students’ free periods or after
school and the group sessions took place after school.
Six groups were run over the course of two academic
years. Three of the groups had one therapist; the other
half had co-therapists. The therapists included the ﬁrst
author and Masters-level psychologists and social
workers who were trained and supervised by the ﬁrst
author. Group size ranged from three to seven adolescents.
One adolescent dropped out of treatment prior to the
ﬁrst group session but completed all assessments.
Among the remaining 26 adolescents in IPT-AST, youth
attended an average of 2.0 pre-group sessions (SD ¼ .2)
and 6.9 group sessions (SD ¼ 1.0). The range was 1–2
pre-group sessions and 5–8 group sessions over 10–
12 weeks. One adolescent in IPT-AST attended a dropin community mental health center during the course of
the intervention. No adolescents in IPT-AST received
medication.

included as covariates. Effect sizes were estimated
using Cohen’s d (Cohen, 1988). The rates of depression
diagnoses on the K-SADS were compared using Fisher’s
Exact Test. The signiﬁcance level, for all tests, was .05
(two sided). All analyses used intent-to-treat principles,
with the last observation carried forward.
Analyses of covariance assume independent observations from each individual. This assumption may be
violated because IPT-AST is a group treatment and because the participants were nested within schools. We
considered including random effects for group and
school but decided against this model because the
small number of groups and schools would result in
statistically unreliable estimates.
Post hoc analyses were conducted to examine
differential intervention effects by severity of initial
depressive symptoms. Adolescents with a CES-D score
of 16–23 were compared to adolescents with a CES-D
score of 24 or higher on post-treatment depression
symptoms and functioning using t-tests and on
depression diagnoses using Fisher’s Exact Test.

School counseling. The remaining adolescents were
referred to the school guidance counselor or social
worker to be seen at a frequency determined by the
adolescent and the clinician. Most adolescents in this
condition received individual counseling, but in one
school the guidance counselor provided group counseling (N ¼ 2). Guidance counselors and social workers
could also refer the adolescent for additional treatment
if the problems worsened or the adolescent requested
more services. Only one adolescent in SC received outside psychotherapy; no adolescents received medication.
School counseling was not intended to be an equivalent intervention to IPT-AST. It was chosen as the
comparison group because it approximates what normally occurs in the schools when an adolescent is
identiﬁed as having mild emotional difﬁculties. We were
interested in whether IPT-AST was more effective at
addressing depression symptoms than the counseling
that normally occurred in these schools. Many of the
adolescents might not have been identiﬁed without the
screening, but once they were identiﬁed, SC mirrored
typical school procedures.
One adolescent in SC dropped out of the study prior
to receiving any treatment. Among the remaining 13
adolescents, participants had an average of 4.2
sessions (SD ¼ 2.2), with a range of 0–7 sessions over
10–12 weeks. The SC sessions were typically 30–
45 minutes in duration and consisted of supportive
counseling. After each session, the counselor completed
a form about the topics discussed. The most commonly
discussed topic was relationships with parents (40.7%),
followed by academic issues (22.2%), relationships with
peers (14.8%), feelings of sadness and anxiety (14.8%),
and ‘other’ (7.5%), including physical complaints,
stress, and extracurricular activities.

Statistical analyses
Efﬁcacy of the prevention interventions was assessed by
conducting an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the
two main outcome measures by treatment condition
post-intervention and at 3- and 6-month follow-up
assessments. Baseline CES-D and CGAS scores were

Results
Main outcomes
At post-intervention, adolescents in IPT-AST reported signiﬁcantly fewer depression symptoms on the
CES-D (M ¼ 6.4, SD ¼ 4.8) than adolescents in SC
(M ¼ 17.4, SD ¼ 10.5), controlling for baseline CESD scores, F1,38 ¼ 18.0; p < .001; ES ¼ 1.52. At
3-month follow-up (IPT-AST: M ¼ 5.5, SD ¼ 4.0; SC:
M ¼ 12.7, SD ¼ 9.8; F1,38 ¼ 12.6; p < .001; ES ¼
1.10) and 6-month follow-up, there continued to be
signiﬁcant differences between the two groups (IPTAST: M ¼ 6.3, SD ¼ 5.4; SC: M ¼ 13.9, SD ¼ 9.3;
F1,38 ¼ 10.7; p < .01; ES ¼ 1.09).
Regarding overall functioning, there was a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups on the CGAS
at post-treatment (IPT-AST: M ¼ 74.6, SD ¼ 6.1; SC:
M ¼ 68.5, SD ¼ 7.3; F1,38 ¼ 5.2; p < .05; ES ¼
).96). There continued to be a signiﬁcant difference
at 3-month follow-up (IPT-AST: M ¼ 78.9, SD ¼ 5.8;
SC: M ¼ 73.3, SD ¼ 8.6; F1,38 ¼ 4.7; p < .05; ES ¼
).82), and 6-month follow-up (IPT-AST: M ¼ 80.0,
SD ¼ 5.1; SC: M ¼ 71.4, SD ¼ 10.0; F1,38 ¼ 10.3;
p < .01; ES ¼ )1.21). See Table 2 for details.

Diagnoses
At the post-intervention assessment, none of the
adolescents in IPT-AST met diagnostic criteria for a
depression diagnosis at post-treatment compared to
3 adolescents in SC (1 for major depressive episode,
2 for DD NOS). At 3-month follow-up, 1 adolescent in
IPT-AST had developed a major depressive episode.
No adolescents in SC had developed a new episode
but 2 of the adolescents continued to have a
depressive episode (1 continued DD NOS, 1 DD NOS
developed into a major depressive episode). At the
6-month assessment, no adolescents in IPT-AST had

a depression diagnosis. In SC, a new adolescent met
criteria for DD NOS and the two adolescents with
diagnoses at 3 months continued to meet criteria (1
now met criteria for dysthymia, 1 had a continuing
major depressive episode). Looking at these data
collectively, 1 of the 27 (3.7%) IPT-AST adolescents
had a depression diagnosis at any time during the
6-month follow-up period compared to 4 of the 14
(28.6%) SC adolescents, Fisher’s Exact Test, p ¼ .08.

Post hoc analyses of treatment effects by severity
Twenty-one adolescents in the sample had an initial
CES-D score of 16 to 23. They were compared to the
20 adolescents with a CES-D score of 24 or higher to
examine potential differential effects of the interventions as a function of initial depression severity.
There were no signiﬁcant differences on post-treatment or follow-up CES-D or CGAS scores between
adolescents with low versus high initial severity in
the overall sample or by intervention condition. One
of the 21 (4.7%) adolescents with a low baseline CESD score developed a depression diagnosis during the
follow-up period compared to four of the 20 (20%)
adolescents with a high baseline CES-D. The difference in rates was not signiﬁcant.

Discussion
The results demonstrate the preliminary efﬁcacy of
IPT-AST compared with SC as an intervention for
adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms.
Adolescents in both conditions showed an improvement in depression scores and overall functioning
from baseline to post-treatment, but the improvement
in the IPT-AST group was signiﬁcantly greater than in
SC. The same was true at the 3-month and 6-month
follow-up. There were no differential intervention
effects by illness severity. The effect sizes for the main
outcomes at post-treatment and at follow-up are
large. Using the same method to compute Cohen’s d,
effect sizes in prior successful prevention studies
range from .27 (Jaycox et al., 1994) to .46 (Clarke
et al., 2001). The large effect sizes in the current study
are particularly noteworthy because this is one of the
ﬁrst prevention studies to include a control condition
that received some, albeit limited, counseling.

The one exception to the small to medium effect
sizes found in prior studies is Cardemil et al.’s
(2002) study with Latino middle school students.
They found a post-intervention effect size of 1.19 for
children with high initial CDI scores and an effect
size of .67 for children with low initial symptoms.
Effect sizes at 3-month follow-up were .90 for the
high symptom group and .34 for the low symptom
group. Both Cardemil et al.’s (2002) study and the
current study included primarily inner city Hispanic
samples. Given the high rates of depression found in
low-income Hispanic populations (e.g., Blazer,
Kessler, McGonagle, & Swartz, 1994; Potter, Rogler,
& Moscicki, 1995) and the high unmet need for
mental health services in this population (Kataoka,
Zhang, & Wells, 2002), these adolescents may be
particularly likely to beneﬁt from a school-based
preventive intervention. As Rossello and Bernal
´
(1999) suggest, interpersonal psychotherapy, with
its focus on relationships, may resonate with the
Hispanic value of placing the family before the individual, making it a particularly potent intervention
model for this population. Future research should
examine whether other interventions are particularly
efﬁcacious with Hispanic adolescents, as well as
whether IPT-AST is equally effective in non-Latino
populations.
A distinction has been made in the prevention literature between treatment and preventive effects.
Some researchers base this distinction on time, such
that immediate treatment effects are differentiated
from long-term preventive effects (Compas, Connor,
& Wadsworth, 1997; Jaycox et al., 1994). Others
suggest that the word ‘treatment’ be used when
symptoms or disorders decline in the intervention
group relative to the control group and the term
‘prevention’ be used when there is an increase in
symptoms or disorders in the control group and no
such increase in the intervention group (Gillham,
Shatte, & Freres, 2000). According to both models,
´
the immediate changes in continuous measures of
depression and overall functioning in the current
study are treatment effects. According to the second
model, the follow-up ﬁndings on the continuous
measures would also be classiﬁed as treatment since
there was no increase in symptoms in the control
group at the follow-up assessments. However, the

trend toward a higher onset of depression diagnoses
in the control condition over the follow-up period
suggests a preventive effect for IPT-AST.
According to the report by the Institute of Medicine, the goal of prevention is to reduce the occurrence of new cases (Mrazek & Haggerty, 1994). With
the exception of the studies by Clarke and his colleagues (Clarke et al., 1995, 2001), most depression
prevention studies have only looked at symptomlevel change. The current study examined both
symptoms and diagnoses, though our ability to analyze the diagnostic data was limited by small sample size. Within the IPT-AST condition, one
adolescent (3.7%) became depressed in the 6 months
following the completion of the intervention compared to four adolescents (28.6%) in SC. Although
the follow-up time period is limited, the diagnostic
ﬁndings are quite promising and suggest that IPTAST may be effective at preventing the onset of
depression diagnoses in the 6 months following the
completion of the intervention.
The main limitation of this study is that less than
half of the eligible adolescents agreed to participate
in the eligibility evaluation. Although there were no
signiﬁcant differences between adolescents who enrolled in the study and those who refused, the high
refusal rate limits our ability to generalize these
ﬁndings. High refusal rates have been found in other
indicated depression prevention studies, with
acceptance rates ranging from 18.4% to 47.1% (e.g.,
Clarke et al., 1995, 2001). As Clarke et al. (2001)
argue, the low enrollment rate suggests that adolescents and their families may not be interested in
preventive services. Future research will need to
determine whether indicated prevention, with low
participation rates and relatively large effect sizes (as
compared to universal programs), is the appropriate
level of prevention (Horowitz & Garber, 2006; Shochet et al., 2001). If it is, then future programs may
want to utilize a motivational enhancement component to increase participation.
Another limitation is the small sample size. The
small number of groups and schools prevented a
statistically reliable examination of the effect of
group and schools. Third, the unbalanced randomization resulted in a small number of adolescents who
received school counseling. Fourth, the majority of
the sample was Hispanic females. The inclusion of
Hispanic adolescents is an asset of the study since
most prevention studies have been with Caucasian
adolescents, and inner city Hispanic adolescents are
an underserved population (Kataoka et al., 2002).
However, the make-up of the sample did not allow us
to test for differences in treatment outcome as a
function of gender or ethnicity. This will be important to examine in future studies since there is mixed
evidence about gender (e.g., Clarke et al., 1993;
Freres et al., 2002; Petersen et al., 1997) and ethnicity (e.g., Cardemil et al., 2002) as moderators
of prevention effects. Fifth, because this was a

preliminary study of a prevention intervention, we
excluded adolescents with certain comorbidities. This
also limits the generalizability of the data. Lastly, the
follow-up time period is relatively short, limiting our
ability to discuss long-term prevention effects.

Conclusion
The ﬁndings from this study suggest that IPT-AST
can decrease symptoms and improve functioning in
adolescents with elevated depression symptoms.
Furthermore, adolescents who participate in IPTAST may be less likely to develop a depressive illness
than adolescents who receive regular school counseling. These results point to the promise of IPT-AST
as an intervention for adolescents with subthreshold
depression. Future research is needed to conﬁrm the
efﬁcacy of IPT-AST with a larger and more diverse
sample and to determine its long-term impact on
depression symptoms, depression diagnoses, and
overall functioning.
