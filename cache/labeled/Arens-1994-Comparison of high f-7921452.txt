Clearance of bronchial secretions is essential in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients admitted
for acute pulmonary exacerbation. Conventional physiotherapy (CPT) is labor-intensive, time-consuming,
expensive, and may not be available as frequently as desired during hospitalization. High frequency chest
compression (HFCC), which uses an inflatable vest linked to an air-pulse delivery system, may offer an
attractive alternative. To study this, we prospectively studied <n>50</n> CF patients admitted for acute pulmonary
exacerbation who were randomly allocated to receive either HFCC or CPT three times a day. On admission,
clinical status and pulmonary function tests (PFT) in the HFCC group were not significantly different from
those measured in the CPT group. Significant improvements in clinical status and PFT were observed after
7 and 14 d of treatment, and were similar in the two study groups, leading to patient discharge after similar
periods of hospitalization. We conclude that HFCC and CPT are equally safe and effective when used during acute pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients. We speculate that HFCC may provide an adequate alternative in management of CF patients in a hospital setting. Arens R, Gozal D, Omlin KJ, Vega J, Boyd

Chest physiotherapy is an essential component in the daily
management of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and has been shown
repeatedly to enhance clearance of bronchial secretions (1-3).
Although various techniques for increasing mucociliary clearance
have been proposed over the years (3-7), conventional physiotherapy (CPT) using manual percussion and postural drainage remains
the standard method of choice (8-10). However, quality of homeadministered CPT,accessibility, compliance, and cost issues are
significant limitations to reqular and effective administration of CPT,
leading to the search for appropriate alternatives.
A method designed for self-administration of chest physiotherapy, high frequency chest compression (HFCC), was developed
recently. This method consists of a mechanical device that generates air pulsating waves at varying frequencies, which are exter-

nally transmitted to the patient's chest. Increased clearance of
tracheal secretions has been demonstrated with HFCC, both in
animals (11-14) and in humans (15-17). However, comparison of
HFCC and CPT during an acute pulmonary exacerbation has not
been critically assessed in hospitalized CF patients. Thus, we conducted the present study to compare the efficacy of HFCC and
CPT, with respect to serial changes in clinical status, pulmonary
function, sputum production, and to assess for potential complications.

METHODS
Fifty CF patients admitted for acute pulmonary exacerbation participated
in this study, which was approved by the institutional review board at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. After informed consent was obtained, patients were randomly allocated to receive either HFCC or CPT. Diagnosis
of CF was based on elevated sweat chloride levels (18)and characteristic
clinical findings.
Acute pulmonary exacerbation was defined as an increase in cough,
sputum production, shortness of breath, weight loss, hypoxia, increased
white blood count, worsening chest X-ray, and/or deterioration in pulmonary tests, which were unresponsive to outpatient therapy inclUding oral,
intravenous, and/or aerosolized antibiotics, CPT, and aerosolized bronchodilator therapy. Patients were admitted to the hospital based on the
treating physician'sbest clinical judgment. Study physicians were not involved in admission decisions, medical management, or discharge. Exclusion criteria were: (1) Inability to perform forced expiratory maneuvers;

(2) Recent placement of central intravenous catheter devices (at least 3
wk postplacement); (3) Recent (3 mo prior to admission) episode of significant hemoptysis; (4)Pneumothorax or chest tube placement in the 6
mo preceding admission. Patientsalready actively participating in the study
who developed acute respiratory distress, hemoptysis, pneumothorax, or
who became noncompliant with study protocol requirements were also
excluded.
All CF patients enrolled in this study were treated with intravenous
antibiotics (according to sputum cultures and susceptibilities), inhaled
bronchodilators, and nutritional support. Supplemental oxygen via nasal
cannula was administered if oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (Sp02)
was ~ 90%. Patients were discharged from the hospital after a minimum
of 14d of hospitalization, return of PFT to baseline, and improvement and
stabilization of clinical respiratory status.

HFCC Group
Patients receiving HFCC were fitted with appropriate-size vests. The vest
was attached via two flexible plastic tubes to an air-pulse delivery system
(ThAIRapy Bronchial Drainage System; American Biosystems, Inc., St.
Paul, MN). The patient received HFCC treatments for approximately 30
min, 3 times/d, while receiving aerosolized bronchodilators (albuterol 0.5
ml diluted in 5 ml of normal saline). Patients were seated upright during
the entire session. The HFCC treatment consisted of six frequency periods
(4 to 5 min each), ranging from 6 to 19 Hz (16, 17). Between each frequency period, the device was stopped. The patient was instructed to perform a maximal inspiratory maneuver and then the pulsating device was
reactivated at 25 Hz for the duration of an expiratory maneuver. The
tient was instructed to actively cough between each of these expiratory
maneuvers, which were repeated three times.

Sputum was collected for 24 h after beginning HFCC or CPT.The firsthour and 24-h wet sputum collection samples were measured. The dry
sputum weight was measured after slow desiccation in a commercial microwave for a period of 10 to 60 min.

Data Analysis
Clinical data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Pulmonary function test
data were expressed as percent predicted for normal using previously
established normative data (20) so that subjects of different height and
sex could be compared. Moreover, each patient was used as his/her own
control, and changes in PFT measurements were expressed as a percentage of admission values. Using the general linear model procedure
we applied separate one-way (group) x two-way (values corresponding
to admission, 1-wk, and 2-wk after admission) ANOVA for repeated measures (21).Dependent variables entered included all measured parameters.
An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine the significance of F-ratios.
A post hoc procedure was used to ascertain significant differences.

RESULTS
Fifty CF patients completed the study, 25 in each treatment group.
Demographic characteristics and clinical measures on admission
were similar in both groups (Table 1). In addition, no significant
differences in admission PFT were found among HFCC- and CPTallocated patients (Table 2).
Clinical assessment after 7 and 14 d of hospitalization showed

pa-

CPT Group
Patients in the CPT group were treated for a period of 30 min, 3 times/d,
by a respiratory therapist using conventional methods of percussion and
postural drainage. Inhalations of aerosolized bronchodilator (albuterol 0.5
ml diluted in 5 ml normal saline) were performed 10 to 15 min before CPT
administration. Postural drainage was performed in six positions (four lying and two sitting), and percussion was administered for 4 min in every
position.

Clinical Assessment
To obtain objective clinical and laboratory measures of improvement in
the two different treatment categories, weight, respiratory rate, and Sp02
were recorded at regular intervals throughout hospitalization. In addition,
hemoglobin, white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count
(ANC), serum protein, and albumin concentrations were drawn on admission and at Days 7 and 14 of hospitalization.

Pulmonary Function Tests
Pulmonary function tests were performed on admission and immediately
before physiotherapy treatment at weekly intervals. Testswere performed
in the pulmonary function laboratory of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles,
located near sea level (mean atmospheric pressure 751 mm Hg), using
the recommended methods (19). Vital capacity (VC) and its subdivisions
were measured from a slow exhalation with a wedge spirometer (Model
3000; MedScience, St. Louis, MO) Forced vital capacity, FEY" and
FEV 2s-7s% were obtained from forced expiration into the wedge spirometer. Functional residual capacity was measured with a body pressure plethysmograph (Sensormedics 2800 Autobox; Sensormedics, Yorba Linda,
CAl. Individual PFT results were analyzed and considered abnormal if
greater than ± 2 SO from available reference values appropriate for age,
height, and gender (20). As a measure of uniformity of ventilation distribution, the slope of Phase III of the single breath nitrogen washout test
(SP3N 2) was measured. The upper limit of the normative values for children used in our laboratory is 2.5% N2 Oxygen saturation (~02) was

a significant improvement in weight gain, respiratory rate, SP02'
WBC, and ANC in both HFCC and CPT groups (p = HFCC versus
CPT: NS, Table 3). Serum protein and albumin evolved similarly
in both groups over time. Duration of hospitalization was similar
for both groups; HFCC (16.0 ± 0.9 d) and CPT (16.2 ± 0.6 d, p =
NS).
Evolution of PFT during hospitalization showed significant improvement after 7 and 14 d in both groups (Table 4). In the HFCC
group, significant increases in VC, FE~, and FEF25-75% , as well
as decreases in RV, RVfTLC, and SP3N2were observed (p < 0.001).
Similar improvements were observed in the CPT group.
There was a significant increase in wet sputum production during the first hour after treatment with HFCC compared with CPT
(Table 5). However, these differences were not observed in dry
sputum weight after 1 h. Sputum production (wet or dry weight)
was also similar in HFCC and CPT after 24-h collection (Table 5).
We could not find a significant change in oxygen saturation
during or following both types of treatments. One patient in the
HFCC group and two in the CPT group developed mild hemoptysis during the study. Treatments were discontinued for 24 hand
then continued with no further hemoptysis. Some patients in the
HFCC group reported occasional mild chest pain and nausea,
particularly during the first 2 to 3 d of treatment, which resolved

thereafter. Three additional patients originally assigned to receive
HFCC, and one patient assigned to the CPT regimen, did not comply to the chest physiotherapy schedules and were excluded from
the study. Twenty-twopatients (88%) in the HFCC group expressed
satisfaction with this technique of chest physiotherapy administration and requested HFCC therapy in the management of future acute pulmonary exacerbations.

DISCUSSION
This study shows that HFCC and CPT have similar effects on clinical status, improvement of PFT, and sputum clearance during
acute pulmonary exacerbation in CF patients. A significant improvement in the above parameters was noted in both groups after 7 d of hospitalization, with further improvement by 14 d. However,the two treatment modalities could not be differentiated based
upon clinical, laboratory, or pulmonary function measures.
Various self-applied techniques for increasing mucociliary
clearance were shown to be effective (3, 5-7). However, these
studies evaluated the effect of a single session only, and their influence on clinical and respiratory status during acute pulmonary
exacerbation has not been determined (3, 5-7). In the present
study, improvement of clinical measures found in the HFCC group
was similar to that found in the CPT group, and these results are
consistent with those found in previous studies (8-10,22-24). In
addition, the HFCC and CPT groups had similar durations of hospitalization, suggesting that the clinical course is not adversely
affected by HFCC administration.
A significantly increased wet sputum production was found during the first hour after administration of HFCC therapy, although
dry weights of these collected sputa were similar to those obtained
from patients receiving CPT. These findings suggest that HFCC
may be initially more efficient in increasing mucociliary fluid clearance or in mobilizing tracheobronchial secretions. HFCC studies
employing animal models have demonstrated enhanced clear-

Brief Communication

ance of secretions from peripheral airways as well as from central airways (11-14), whereas only central airways mobilization
could be demonstrated with the use of CPT (2, 3, 5-7). King and
colleagues suggested that HFCC enhances tracheobronchial
secretions by the effect of chest wall vibration of variable amplitude and frequency, and by increased mucus-air flow interaction,
causing a reduction in the crosslink density and viscosity properties of mucus (11). However, different modes of administration of
aerosolized bronchodilators in HFCC and CPT may have also affected the immediate, first-hour wet sputum production, without
affecting the total daily wet sputum, or dry sputum weights. A single study on 13 stable CF patients showed that HFCC was as effective as CPT in production of wet sputum but was significantly
superior when the dry sputum weight was measured (15). We could
not confirm these results, except for the similar efficacy of both
methods when comparing the wet sputum production of 24 h.
In this study, serial measurements of PFT in HFCC and CPT
groups showed significant but similar improvements at both 7 and
14 d. The magnitude of PFT improvement in HFCC and CPT is
in close agreement with other reports assessing changes in pulmonary function during the management of acute exacerbations
in CF patients undergoing in-hospital CPT treatment (8-10, 22,
24, 25), including a previous study on 71 admissions managed
with CPT in our institution (26).
The HFCC device was not associated with significant side ef<'
fects during the study period. Mild hemoptysis, whenever present, was easily controlled by 24-h interruption of chest physiotherapy, and no further bleeding occurred upon resumption of
treatment. Thus, HFCC seems to be a safe alternative to CPT.
We conclude that HFCC and CPT are equally safe and effective in the management of acute pulmonary exacerbations in CF
patients. Although our study is the first report on the efficacy of
HFCC in a hospital setting, the long term efficacy of HFCC as
an outpatient option has also been suggested (17). Further studies
are required to establish the efficacy of HFCC and CPT in the longterm care of CF patients.
