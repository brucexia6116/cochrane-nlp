Abstract
Background: intermediate care (IC) services have been widely introduced in England and have the strategic objectives of
reducing hospital and long-term care use. There is uncertainty about the clinical outcomes of these services and whether their
strategic aims will be realised.
Setting: a metropolitan city in northern England.
Design: a quasi-experimental study comparing a group of older people before and after the introduction of an IC service. A
quota sampling method was used to match the groups.
Subjects: patients presenting as emergency admissions to two elderly care departments with falls, confusion, incontinence or
immobility.
Intervention: a city-wide service in which a joint care management team (multi-agency, multi-disciplinary) assessed patient
need and purchased support and rehabilitation from sector-based IC teams.
Outcomes: Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living score, Barthel Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression score,
mortality, readmission to hospital, and new institutional care placement at 3, 6 and 12 months post-recruitment.
Results: there were 800 and 848 patients, respectively, in the control and intervention groups. Clinical outcomes, hospital and long-term care use were similar between the groups. Uptake of IC was lower than anticipated at 29%. An
embedded case–control study comparing the 246 patients who received IC with a matched sample from the control
group demonstrated similar clinical outcomes but increased hospital bed days used over 12 months (mean +8 days; 95%
CI 3.1–13.0).
Conclusion: this city-wide IC service was associated with similar clinical outcomes but did not achieve its strategic objectives of reducing long-term care and hospital use.

A whole system study of intermediate care
services for older people

J. B.Young et al.

Introduction

Leeds intermediate care service

Leeds Health Authority and Leeds City Council developed
jointly a commissioning framework for older people’s services designed to provide support and rehabilitation either at
home or through short-term care home placements [1]. It is
a city-wide service [8] in which a joint care management
team (multi-disciplinary, multi-agency) assesses need and
purchases services for individuals delivered through primary
care trust (PCT) based IC teams comprising nurses, therapists and social service staff (see Appendix 1). There was an
expectation, in line with national policy [4], that short-term
contact following hospital admission or during a health crisis at home would reduce demand for hospital and institutional care. Thus, the new service was in part funded by
transfer of money from secondary care [8].

Baseline assessments

Baseline assessment by research nurses recorded age, sex,
accommodation type, living arrangements, assessed cognitive
function (Abbreviated Mental Test, AMT) [11], current
activities of daily living (Barthel Index, BI) [12], pre-admission
extended activities of daily living (Nottingham Extended
Activities of Daily Living, NEADL) [13] and mood state
(Hospital Anxiety and Depression score, HAD) [14].
Outcomes

The primary outcome was independence at 6 months
post-recruitment measured by the NEADL score [13].
A sample size calculation using a previously obtained
NEADL standard deviation of 5.8 [15] with a non-inferiority
(clinically irrelevant) [16] tolerance limit of one scale point
indicated that over 600 analysable patients would be
required in each group. Secondary outcomes recorded at
3, 6 and 12 months post-recruitment were BI, HAD, mortality,
readmission to hospital and new institutional care placement.
Outcomes were obtained during research nurse home
visits. After completion of the final follow-up assessments,
the IC service registers were inspected to identify contacts
with the intervention group patients during the 12 months
of the study.

Methods

Analysis

A quasi-experimental study design [9] was developed in
which a group of frail older patients recruited before the
introduction of IC services (control group) was compared
with another group of similar patients recruited and followed
up after the introduction of IC (intervention group).

An independent statistician not otherwise involved with the
study produced statistical summaries and analyses using the
software SPSS 11.0.0 and Microsoft Excel. The primary
analysis was a non-inferiority test of NEADL score changes
from baseline to 6-month reassessment. The null hypothesis was that response for the intervention group patients
was more than one NEADL score point worse than for the
control group. This was tested using the Mann–Whitney
U test (MWU) for the difference between the means of
baseline to reassessment score changes of the two groups
and interpretation of the results was aided by calculation of
95% CIs. The between-group score changes were also
examined with adjustment for baseline variables (age, sex,
institutional care or living at home, cognitively impaired
(AMT score 7 or less) and PCT) using analysis of covariance. There was a high mortality during follow-up and as
this might be associated with a survival response bias, the
analyses were repeated after assigning the worse NEADL
score value (zero) for the patients who had died by
6 months. Additionally, the IC service contact for the intervention group was less than anticipated and demonstration

Patient recruitment

Patients with an address within three of the five local PCT
areas, and admitted as emergency referrals to the two elderly
care departments in Leeds with the clinical syndromes of
falls, incontinence, confusion or poor mobility, and who
were still in hospital after 7 days, were eligible for the study.
Patients with rapid recovery and discharge within 7 days, or
with continuing medical instability, or considered by the
clinical team to have a poor short-term prognosis, were
excluded. The aim was to recruit 50 consecutively admitted
frail older people from each elderly care department each
month as this was consistent with the anticipated capacity
of the IC services. To optimise between group matching, a
quota-sampling frame was designed to produce a 2:1 female
to male ratio, and equal numbers of patients with pre-

In England, and elsewhere, recuperation and rehabilitation
of older people has taken place largely in hospitals, but
recent policy emphasis favouring a primary care-led
National Health Service has stimulated a need to examine
alternatives with a more home-based orientation [1–3]. A
range of services under the umbrella term intermediate care
(IC) have been proposed and have become an established
health care policy within the National Service Framework
for Older People (NSF) [4]. However, concern has been
expressed that these services might be inferior to existing
hospital services [5, 6] for which there is considerable evidence of effectiveness [7]. We therefore report a controlled
clinical trial that examines the concept of a home-based
recuperation and rehabilitation policy for older people in
respect of a newly introduced IC service in a metropolitan
city in England. The study investigates the clinical outcomes
of the new service and its effects on hospital and institutional care use.

admission confusion and mobility restriction: two factors
known to influence medium-term outcomes [10]. Patients
were identified by twice-weekly visits to the participating
wards by research nurses until the monthly quota-sampling
cells were complete. Recruitment from each of the two elderly
care departments took place separately during approximately
6-month blocks (November 1998–July 1999 and May–
November 2000 for the control group; and January–July
2001 and May–October 2001 for the intervention group).
Consent was sought when medical stability had occurred or,
if mental incapacity was apparent, a family member was asked
for assent. The local ethics committee approved the study.

Results
The study recruited 1,648 patients: 800 before (control
group) and 848 after (intervention group) the introduction
of the city-wide IC service. Of these, 333 (39%) in the intervention group and 301 (38%) in the control group had died
by 12 months. The study groups were similar and comprised
largely community-dwelling but disabled older people, and a
high proportion had mental impairment (Table 1). Patient
follow-up was incomplete for 33 and 24 patients, respectively, in the control and intervention groups.

Primary outcome (Table 2)

The 95% CIs for the comparison between the mean differences of the baseline to 6-month reassessment NEADL
score changes for the two groups were well within the
tolerance limit of ±1 NEADL score point, allowing the conclusion that IC was not inferior to the previous care system
(difference of the mean differences = –0.29; 95% CIs –0.69
to 0.11; MWU P < 0.001). Adjusting for baseline variable
imbalance supported the non-inferiority conclusion (difference
of the mean differences = –0.33; 95% CIs –0.73 to 0.07;
MWU P < 0.001). The analysis to investigate the potential
bias due to mortality by allocating the worst NEADL score
of zero to the non-surviving patients was also consistent
with the non-inferiority conclusion (difference of the mean
differences = 0.18; 95% CIs –0.27 to 0.62; MWU P < 0.001).
Secondary outcomes (Table 2)

The between-group differences of the mean score changes
from baseline to reassessments at 3, 6 and 12 months after
recruitment for the BI and HAD scores, and their associated 95% CIs, were small and unlikely to be of clinical significance. Differences in mortality, new institutional care
placement and hospital readmissions were also small, but
with wider CIs and trends to lower institutional care placement but higher use of hospital care for the intervention
group.
Embedded case–control study

Only 246 (29%) of the intervention patients actually
received the IC services: 90% hospital-at-home and 56%
within 10 days of hospital discharge. These patients were
matched with a random sample from the control group.
The IC group had slightly worse NEADL change scores

of non-inferiority in these circumstances might be simply a
dilution effect. To address this, an embedded case– control
study was undertaken in which patients who had received
IC in the intervention group were matched (by locality, sex,
institutional care (yes/no), age and baseline NEADL) with
randomly selected patients from the control group. Adjustment
for imbalance due to deaths was carried out as before with
assignment of worst NEADL score (zero) and non-inferiority between the groups tested by Wilcoxon’s matched pairs
signed rank test.
Comparisons between the groups for the secondary
outcomes were made by calculating 95% CIs for changes
from baseline to the reassessment points. In addition, for
the HAD scores, the percentage in each group classified as a
‘case’ (HAD score ≥11) is presented. The percentage of
deaths, new institutional care placements (using a denominator of the number of patients living at home at recruitment), the mean number of hospital readmission episodes
per patient and mean hospital days used were compared by
tabulation and 95% CIs for the differences between the
groups calculated.

Scores are between baseline and 3, 6 and 12 month reassessments for the intervention and control groups with between-group comparisons by the difference of
the means (95% CIs). Mortality is number (percentage) between baseline and each reassessment point. Hospital use is number of episodes, and days, per patient
with group means (SD) between baseline and each reassessment point. New institutional placement is number and percentage (denominator is number of patients
living at home) between each reassessment point.

compared with the controls at all assessment times (Table 3),
though statistical non-inferiority was demonstrated when
adjustment for deaths was undertaken (Wilcoxon matched
pairs signed rank sum test P = 0.008). Mortality and new
institutional care placements were similar but hospital use
over the 12 months of the study was greater for the IC
group (+8 days; 95% CIs 3.1–13.0).

Discussion
This study was designed to assess the clinical consequences
of a new city-wide policy of care closer to home for older

people delivered through sector-based, multi-disciplinary,
multi-agency IC teams. The service was established following considerable joint health and social care planning, and
was well resourced [8]. Our target study population was frail
older people—the principal recipient group proposed for
IC services [4]. Our definition of frailty was a pragmatic one
based on the non-specific ill-health syndromes (falls, confusion, incontinence and immobility) through which frail
older people commonly present to health and social care
services [17]. Patients were recruited only from specialist
elderly care wards for which there is strong evidence that
medium-term outcomes are optimised [7]. Patients who had

Scores are between baseline and 3, 6 and 12 month reassessments for the intermediate care and matched control groups with between-group comparisons by the
difference of the means (95% CIs). Mortality is number (percentage) between baseline and each reassessment point. Hospital use is number of episodes, and days,

of patients living at home) between each reassessment point.

recovered rapidly and were discharged within 7 days of
admission were excluded from the study (unlikely to be
frail), and also those patients considered by their clinicians
to have advanced disease with a poor short-term prognosis.
The resulting study population was largely community
dwelling, but disabled, and a high proportion had mental
impairment.
Important strengths of the study were the successful
recruitment of a substantial population of frail older people
(n = 1,648) and the near complete (97%) follow-up of the
patients. The new city-wide IC service was associated with

similar clinical and resource use outcomes over the 12
months of follow-up. However, these findings might have
been affected by the lower than anticipated uptake of IC in
the intervention group. An embedded case–control study was
therefore constructed by matching the 246 intervention
patients receiving IC with patients randomly selected from
the control group. In this analysis there was evidence that the
NEADL change scores were statistically worse in the IC
group, though this effect was lost when adjustment for deaths
was made. Additionally, the IC group used more hospital bed
days over the 12 months (+8 days). The case–control study

may have been underpowered to demonstrate changes in
independence associated with the IC service but the upper
limit for the 95% CIs for the between-group NEADL score
differences were less than one score point, suggesting a clinically meaningful difference is unlikely to have been missed.
Also, the NEADL measure may have lacked sensitivity to
change. However, it has successfully discriminated between
groups in an evaluation of an early discharge rehabilitation
service—a service similar to the one in our study [18].
The confounding of intervention introduction and time
is well recognised as an important threat to internal validity
in quasi-experimental studies [19]. In our study, the introduction of IC coincided with the implementation of PCTs
but there were no major changes in community service
delivery other than the implementation of IC. The impact
of seasonality was controlled for by the patient groups being
recruited during similar 6-month periods before, and after,
the introduction of the IC service.
The predominant form of IC received by the patients in
the intervention group was a hospital-at-home service in
which daily supportive care is augmented by a process of
rehabilitation. A summary of the randomised controlled
trial evidence (16 trials) has demonstrated reduced hospital
bed use associated with hospital-at-home care [20]. Our study,
investigating IC in a context in which patient selection and
management are less influenced by research processes, indicates that this outcome may not be realised in clinical
practice. Within the methodological constraints of our
quasi-experimental study design, the new IC service was
clinically safe (similar independence, mood state and mortality outcomes), but had no impact on institutional care
placements and may have been associated with an increase
in hospital use. The lower than anticipated contact of the IC
services with our group of frail older people, compounded
by the apparent delay in service engagement (44% of
patients receiving IC did so more than 10 days after discharge), are also important findings. They suggest that close
integration of IC with other older peoples services, a factor
considered important to successful IC [21], has not been
adequately achieved.

Abstract
Background: transplantation is the best treatment for patients with chronic renal failure, including the elderly. However, the
patient’s age was traditionally considered as a relative contraindication for it.
Objective: to compare the results of renal transplantation in patients over and under 60 years of age.
Methods: analysis of 621 transplant recipients in Galicia (Spain) between 1996 and 2000, divided into two groups, according
to age over 60 years (484) or under 60 years (137). The actuarial method, Kaplan–Meier curves, log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model were used to study survival.
Results: graft survival for those aged under 60 years was 82% and 70% at 1 and 5 years, while it was 73% and 56% for those
over 60 years. However, censuring the deceased patients with a functioning graft, it was 84% and 76% for those aged under
60 years and 83% and 77% for those over 60 years. A total of 47% of the graft losses in the group over 60 years were due to the
patient’s death. Overall graft survival for all the patients was greater (P < 0.0001) when the donor was under 60 years of age.
Conclusions: recipient age alone cannot be a criterion to exclude patients over 60 years from transplantation, since their
lower survival is influenced by comorbidity and the donor’s age.
Keywords: elderly patients, renal transplantation, graft survival, mortality

Introduction
Life expectancy has increased in recent decades, so that those
over 60 years represent an important segment of the general
population. Thus, more than a quarter of the citizens in NorthWest Spain are older than this age [1]. Due to the characteristics of chronic renal disease, which increases with age, these
demographic changes are clearly reflected in the population
affected. Thus, this disease’s incidence and prevalence have
doubled in those over 60 in the United States during the last

decade, representing more than 60% of the patients who initiated renal substitutive treatment in the year 2002 [2]. This percentage is similar to that of European countries [3] and there is
even a significant proportion of those over 80, for whom renal
replacement therapy is still an effective treatment [4].
Traditionally, the patient’s age was considered as a relative
contraindication for renal transplantation. This is fundamentally due to the elevated comorbidity of the elderly undergoing
renal replacement therapy and because the scarcity of donors
encouraged the selection of those recipients who presumably
