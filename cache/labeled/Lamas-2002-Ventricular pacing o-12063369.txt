FOR THE MODE SELECTION TRIAL IN SINUS-NODE DYSFUNCTION*

ABSTRACT
Background Dual-chamber (atrioventricular) and
single-chamber (ventricular) pacing are alternative
treatment approaches for sinus-node dysfunction
that causes clinically significant bradycardia. However,
it is unknown which type of pacing results in the better
outcome.
Methods We randomly assigned a total of 2010 patients with sinus-node dysfunction to dual-chamber
pacing (1014 patients) or ventricular pacing (996 patients) and followed them for a median of 33.1 months.
The primary end point was death from any cause or
nonfatal stroke. Secondary end points included the
composite of death, stroke, or hospitalization for heart
failure; atrial fibrillation; heart-failure score; the pacemaker syndrome; and the quality of life.
Results The incidence of the primary end point
did not differ significantly between the dual-chamber
group (21.5 percent) and the ventricular-paced group
(23.0 percent, P=0.48). In patients assigned to dualchamber pacing, the risk of atrial fibrillation was lower
(hazard ratio, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.66
to 0.94; P=0.008), and heart-failure scores were better
(P<0.001). The differences in the rates of hospitalization for heart failure and of death, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure were not significant in unadjusted analyses but became marginally significant
in adjusted analyses. Dual-chamber pacing resulted
in a small but measurable increase in the quality of life,
as compared with ventricular pacing.
Conclusions In sinus-node dysfunction, dual-chamber pacing does not improve stroke-free survival, as
compared with ventricular pacing. However, dualchamber pacing reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation,
reduces signs and symptoms of heart failure, and
slightly improves the quality of life. Overall, dualchamber pacing offers significant improvement as
compared with ventricular pacing. (N Engl J Med

INCE the first implantation of a cardiac pacemaker in a human in 1958,1 technological advances have enhanced the sophistication of cardiac pacemakers, but there has been no clear
evidence of the advantages of more complex devices.2-4 For example, dual-chamber pacing maintains
atrioventricular synchrony and may better preserve
normal physiologic function as compared with singlechamber ventricular pacemakers,5-7 but dual-chamber
pacemakers are more expensive, are more complex to
implant and program, and have a higher rate of complications.8 Although retrospective studies and case series suggest benefits of dual-chamber or atrial-based
pacing,9,10 randomized trials have had divergent results
with regard to rates of death and stroke, particularly in
patients with sinus-node dysfunction.11-14 We investigated whether dual-chamber pacing would provide
better event-free survival and quality of life than singlechamber ventricular pacing in patients with sinus-node
dysfunction.
METHODS
The Mode Selection Trial in Sinus-Node Dysfunction (MOST)
was designed as a five-year trial to compare single-chamber (ventricular), rate-modulated pacing with dual-chamber (atrioventricular), rate-modulated pacing in patients whose sinus-node dysfunction required permanent pacing for bradycardia.15 The first patient
was enrolled on September 25, 1995, and the last patient on Octo-

months.

syndrome required signs and symptoms of elevated right-sided or
left-sided filling pressures or hypotension with ventricular pacing.13,15

Selection of Patients

The study was designed to have over 90 percent power to detect
a 25 percent reduction in the rate of the primary end point and over
80 percent power to detect a 25 percent reduction in mortality
in the dual-chamber group. Unless otherwise specified, treatment
groups were compared on an intention-to-treat basis. All statistical
tests were two-tailed. Cumulative event rates were calculated by
the Kaplan–Meier method,24 and differences between the treatment
groups were assessed with the log-rank test. 25 Relative risk was
expressed as a hazard ratio (with a 95 percent confidence interval).26
As specified in the study protocol, supplemental analyses adjusted
for selected base-line characteristics with the use of the Cox proportional-hazards model.26 An independent data and safety monitoring board monitored interim analyses with two-sided, symmetric
O’Brien–Fleming 27 boundaries generated with the Lan–DeMets 28
spending-function approach to group-sequential testing. The heartfailure score, calculated as an average score per visit, was analyzed
with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Each of the SF-36 scale and summary scores, the time-tradeoff
utility scores, and the score on the Specific Activity Scale were compared with the use of a repeated-measures analysis of variance. An
unstructured correlation matrix was used to adjust for dependence
across the five time points, and the model included covariates for
age group, sex, and base-line quality of life. Since there were no
significant interactions between time and the effect of treatment,
significance testing considered only the single-effect estimate across
all time points. Analyses are presented as the adjusted average change
from base line in each study group. For patients who crossed over
from single to dual pacing, health status at the time of the crossover
was carried forward; in a secondary analysis, actual health status,
which commonly was improved by crossing over, was assessed. The
principal investigators had full access to the data and independently
performed all data analyses.

Patients were eligible if they were at least 21 years old; were
undergoing initial implantation of a dual-chamber, rate modulated
pacing system for sinus-node dysfunction; and were in sinus rhythm
when randomly assigned to treatment. To be eligible for the qualityof-life analyses, patients had to score 17 or higher on the Mini–
Mental State Examination16 before implantation. Patients with serious concurrent illnesses, as determined by the investigator at each
site, were excluded.
Collection of Data before Implantation
Written informed consent was obtained before implantation.
Trained research coordinators collected base-line demographic, clinical, and quality-of-life data. Coexisting conditions were assessed
with the Charlson comorbidity index.17 Multidimensional healthrelated quality of life was assessed with the Medical Outcomes
Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36).18 The
individual components of the SF-36 were used to calculate summary
scores for the physical and mental components.19 Cardiovascular
functional status was measured with the Specific Activity Scale. 20
Utilities were assessed with the time-tradeoff approach, in which
patients are asked a series of questions to determine how much
time in their present state of health they would trade for perfect
health.21
Implantation, Randomization, Programming
of Pacemakers, and Monitoring of Patients
After both atrial and ventricular leads were positioned, a 24-hour
randomization line was called, and the pacemaker was programmed
to the randomly assigned mode (rate-modulated dual-chamber
pacing or rate-modulated ventricular pacing) before implantation.
Patients were unaware of the pacing assignment. Randomization
was stratified according to the history of stroke and the clinical site.
For both assigned modes, the lower heart rate was programmed to
be at least 60 beats per minute, and the upper rate to be at least 110
beats per minute.
Follow-up evaluations occurred four times during the first year
and twice yearly thereafter. Quality-of-life assessments were performed 3 and 12 months after enrollment and yearly thereafter,
with use of the SF-36 scales,18,19 the time-tradeoff utility score, 21
and the Specific Activity Scale class. 20
Primary and Secondary End Points
The primary end point was death from any cause or nonfatal
stroke. Prespecified secondary end points included the composite
of death from any cause, a first occurrence of stroke, or a first occurrence of hospitalization for heart failure; death from any cause; death
from cardiovascular causes; atrial fibrillation; the Minnesota Living
with Heart Failure score 22; the pacemaker syndrome 23 with a need
for permanent reprogramming to dual-chamber pacing; and healthrelated quality of life. A clinical-events committee that was unaware
of the assigned pacing mode classified deaths according to cause and
adjudicated all suspected strokes and hospitalizations for heart
failure. An electrocardiographic core laboratory reviewed electrocardiograms and confirmed diagnoses of atrial fibrillation. Investigators at each site categorized patients as having chronic atrial
fibrillation if they had atrial fibrillation without intervening sinus
rhythm on more than one visit. The heart-failure score, which assigns points for symptoms and signs as well as intensification of
medical therapy for heart failure, correlates with exercise capacity22
and mortality after myocardial infarction (unpublished data). Higher
points indicate more severe disease. The diagnosis of the pacemaker

Statistical Analysis

RESULTS
Base-Line Characteristics

The median age of the 2010 patients was 74 years;
48 percent were women (Table 1). Hypertension was
reported by 62 percent, and diabetes by 22 percent. A
history of myocardial infarction was reported by 26
percent of patients, and a history of heart failure by 20
percent. Over 80 percent of patients were in New York
Heart Association class I or II at base line. Over 50
percent of patients had a history of supraventricular
tachycardia, generally atrial fibrillation or flutter that
had occurred within the past three weeks. The indication for pacemaker implantation was sinus-node dysfunction in all cases, but 21 percent of patients also
had atrioventricular block. A total of 1014 patients
were assigned to dual-chamber pacing, and 996 patients were assigned to ventricular pacing.
Primary End Point

The primary end point, death or nonfatal stroke,
occurred in 447 patients (22.2 percent). There were
no significant differences between patients receiving
dual-chamber pacing (21.5 percent) and those receiving ventricular pacing (23.0 percent, P=0.48)
(Fig. 1 and Table 2).

*P values for categorical variables present in less than 10 percent of patients
were calculated with Fisher’s exact test; for other categorical variables,
P values were calculated with the likelihood-ratio chi-square test. For continuous variables, P values were calculated with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

(Fig. 1 and Table 2). Of 487 patients in whom atrial
fibrillation developed after randomization, 105 (21.6
percent) had chronic atrial fibrillation (15.2 percent of
patients with dual-chamber pacing, as compared with
26.7 percent of patients with ventricular pacing;
hazard ratio for chronic atrial fibrillation in the overall study population, 0.44; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.29 to 0.67; P<0.001). Patients receiving
dual-chamber pacing who had no history of atrial fibrillation had a 50 percent lower incidence of atrial
fibrillation after randomization (hazard ratio as compared with ventricular pacing, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.76; P=0.001), whereas patients receiving dual-chamber pacing who had a
history of atrial fibrillation had a smaller, nonsignificant 14 percent reduction (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.04; P=0.12).
Heart Failure

Hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 10.3
percent of the patients receiving dual-chamber pacing and 12.3 percent of the patients receiving ventricular pacing (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95 percent confidence
interval, 0.63 to 1.06; P=0.13). Patients who did not
have a history of heart failure at the time of enrollment
accounted for 51 percent of hospitalizations for heart
failure, and the hazard ratios for the treatment groups
were similar in patients with a history of heart failure
(0.74; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 1.07)
and without such a history (0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.55 to 1.13). During follow-up, patients receiving dual-chamber pacing accumulated fewer points per visit on the heart-failure score than did
patients receiving ventricular pacing (average points
per visit during follow-up: ventricular pacing, 1.75;
dual-chamber pacing, 1.49; P<0.001).
Adjusted Analyses

Death, Nonfatal Stroke, or Hospitalization for Heart Failure

Stroke occurred in 4.5 percent of the study population, death from any cause in 20.1 percent, and the
composite end point — death, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure — in 28.8 percent. Death from
cardiovascular causes occurred in 8.9 percent. Unadjusted analyses did not reveal any significant differences
between the treatment groups in the rate of any of the
end points (Fig. 1 and Table 2).
Atrial Fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation occurred in 24.2 percent of the
study population, including 4.8 percent in whom it
developed for the first time. The incidence of atrial
fibrillation after randomization was significantly lower
in the dual-chamber group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95
percent confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.94; P=0.008)

Multivariable analyses were performed to control
for slightly higher proportions of patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, congestive heart
failure, and supraventricular tachycardia in the group
receiving dual-chamber pacing. Adjusted analyses had
minimal influence on the estimate of the effect of
treatment on the primary end point. However, the
adjusted hazard ratio was 0.73 (95 percent confidence
interval, 0.56 to 0.95; P=0.02) for hospitalization
for heart failure and 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.00; P=0.05) for death, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure (the combined clinical end
point).
Prespecified Subgroups

There were no statistically significant differences
in the risk of death, stroke, and hospitalization for
heart failure between the two treatment groups among

Quality of Life

At three months, both ventricular pacing and dualchamber pacing led to substantial improvement in

the SF-36 physical role (18 points for ventricular pacing, about 1.3 times the effect of a history of angina
or heart failure in study patients), but a much smaller
1.9-point change in the SF-36 physical function
(only about 10 to 15 percent of the effect of a history
of angina or heart failure in study patients). Over a
period of four years, dual-chamber pacing provided

of the patients were subsequently switched back to
the originally assigned mode. Thus, at the last followup, 313 patients (31.4 percent) assigned to ventricular
pacing were receiving dual-chamber pacing. The pace-

maker syndrome as strictly defined by the protocol
was present in 113 of these patients, whereas an additional 69 had symptoms of severe pacemaker syndrome but did not fully meet the strict definition.
Consequently, clinical pacemaker syndrome was the
principal reason for crossover in 18.3 percent of patients assigned to ventricular pacing and in 48.9 percent of all patients who crossed over. Most crossovers
due to the pacemaker syndrome occurred early (69
percent by 3 months and 73 percent by 6 months;
median time to crossover, 58 days). Other reasons for
crossover are listed in Table 4.
Complications

The rate of complications within 30 days after pacemaker implantation was 4.8 percent. The most frequent complications were dislodgement or failure of
the atrial lead in 1.8 percent, pneumothorax in 1.5
percent, and complications associated with the ventricular lead in 1.1 percent. There were no instances of
death as a complication of implantation of a permanent pacemaker.
DISCUSSION

In 2000, over 225,000 pacemakers were implanted
in the United States, and over 600,000 were implanted worldwide. Historically, sinus-node dysfunction,
a disorder of unknown cause, represents the diagnosis
leading to implantation in about one half of all pacemaker recipients in the United States.10 To date, clinical
recommendations and guidelines regarding the selection of pacing systems have been based on small clinical studies and retrospective analyses of existing data
bases.29
When viewed in aggregate, the first randomized
trials comparing ventricular with dual-chamber pacing11-14 suggested that dual-chamber pacing reduces
the rates of death, stroke, and heart failure, particularly
among patients with sinus-node dysfunction. These
small trials led to the expectation that larger trials
would confirm the superiority of dual-chamber pacing
for sinus-node dysfunction.
The Canadian Trial of Physiologic Pacing (CTOPP)8
compared physiologic (i.e., atrial or dual-chamber)
pacing with ventricular pacing in 2568 patients and
reported no differences in the rates of death, stroke,
or hospitalizations for heart failure. CTOPP included
1077 patients with sinus-node dysfunction and thus
did not have sufficient statistical power to exclude a
moderate benefit of physiologic pacing. In the present
trial in 2010 patients, we also found no statistically
significant differences when comparing dual-chamber
with ventricular pacing in terms of death from any
cause, death from cardiovascular causes, or stroke.
The loss of atrioventricular synchrony with ventricular pacing is associated with enlargement of the

left atrium,30 and retrospective studies noted a marked
reduction in atrial fibrillation31 with dual-chamber
pacing. A more moderate reduction, principally in patients with sinus-node disease, was found in two small
prospective trials12,13 and confirmed by CTOPP. In
contrast to CTOPP, 21 percent of whose patients had
a history of supraventricular arrhythmia, the prevalence
of prior supraventricular tachycardia in our trial was
over 50 percent, and we found a 56 percent reduction
in the subsequent development of chronic atrial fibrillation with dual-chamber pacing than with ventricular
pacing.
The preservation of atrioventricular synchrony has
been thought to be central to the maintenance of optimal cardiac performance.5-7 Signs and symptoms of
heart failure, as assessed by the heart-failure score,22
were less severe with dual-chamber pacing than with
ventricular pacing. Unadjusted comparisons of hospitalizations for heart failure reflected an insignificant
18 percent reduction in risk, whereas multivariable
analyses that adjusted for base-line imbalances revealed
a marginally significant reduction in hospitalizations
for heart failure with dual-chamber pacing.
A high incidence of the pacemaker syndrome,
which is thought to be due to loss of atrioventricular
synchrony, was observed in the group receiving ventricular pacing.32 In observational studies, the incidence of the pacemaker syndrome has been reported
to be as high as 83 percent.33 In the Pacemaker Selection in the Elderly (PASE) trial, the pacemaker syndrome occurred in 26 percent of patients during an
average follow-up of 18 months.13 In our trial, 16.5
percent of the patients receiving ventricular pacing

crossed over to dual-chamber pacing because of the
pacemaker syndrome. In both the PASE trial and our
study, about 75 percent of crossovers occurred within
six months.
The high incidence of the pacemaker syndrome
reported here is in sharp contrast to the low incidence
(1.7 percent) reported by Andersen et al.11,12 and the
2.7 percent rate at three years reported in CTOPP.8
In our study and the PASE trial,13,31 only reprogramming was required to change from ventricular to physiologic pacing, whereas reoperation was necessary in
the other two studies. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude
the possibility that there are different clinical thresholds for the diagnosis of such a subjective condition
in different countries.
The quality-of-life benefits of dual-chamber pacing
over ventricular pacing were generally small in comparison with the differences based on the presence
of angina or heart failure. Although physical role improved by an amount equivalent to about 60 percent
of the improvement associated with a change of one
class on the Specific Activity Scale, the changes were
much smaller for physical function and perception of
health. These data suggest that dual-chamber pacing
has incremental benefits in terms of the ability to perform physical tasks at the margin of a person’s own
capacity but does not have dramatic incremental benefits over ventricular pacing in terms of the number
of blocks walked or stairs climbed. In addition, the
incremental benefits of dual-chamber pacing were,
in part, offset by age-related declines in function over
the course of the study.
Limitations in the design of the study may have
affected our results. We randomly assigned programming, not the type of pacemaker. Since mode changes
are easier with this design, we may have overestimated
the true incidence of the pacemaker syndrome and
reduced the number of clinical events in the ventricular-pacing group. Dual-chamber pacing, by necessity,
led to atrial synchronous ventricular pacing in many
patients. There is increasing recognition that a ventricular-paced beat, with a wide QRS interval and left
bundle-branch block morphology, may be hemodynamically disadvantageous and may even blunt the
benefits of atrial pacing. Finally, given the study design, it is impossible to determine whether atrialbased pacing prevents atrial fibrillation or whether
ventricular pacing is arrhythmogenic and thus causes
atrial fibrillation.
We conclude that for patients with sinus-node
dysfunction, dual-chamber pacing, as compared with
single-chamber ventricular pacing, did not improve
the rate of our primary end point of stroke-free survival. However, when compared with ventricular pacing, dual-chamber pacing reduces newly diagnosed
and chronic atrial fibrillation, reduces signs and symp-

toms of heart failure, and slightly improves the quality
of life.
