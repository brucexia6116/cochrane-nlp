Abstract Background. Older persons who are hospitalized for acute illnesses often lose their independence
and are discharged to institutions for long-term care.
Methods. We studied <n>651</n> patients 70 years of age or
older who were admitted for general medical care at a
teaching hospital; these patients were randomly assigned
to receive usual care or to be cared for in a special unit
designed to help older persons maintain or achieve independence in self-care activities. The key elements of this
program were a specially prepared environment (with, for
example, uncluttered hallways, large clocks and calendars, and handrails); patient-centered care emphasizing
independence, including speciﬁc protocols for prevention
of disability and for rehabilitation; discharge planning with
the goal of returning the patient to his or her home; and
intensive review of medical care to minimize the adverse
effects of procedures and medications. The main outcome we measured was the change from admission to
discharge in the number of ﬁve basic activities of daily living (bathing, getting dressed, using the toilet, moving
from a bed to a chair, and eating) that the patient could
perform independently.
Results. Twenty-four patients in each group died in
the hospital. At the time of discharge, 65 (21 percent) of
the 303 surviving patients in the intervention group were
classiﬁed as much better in terms of their ability to per-

form basic activities of daily living, 39 (13 percent) as
better, 151 (50 percent) as unchanged, 22 (7 percent) as
worse, and 26 (9 percent) as much worse. In the usualcare group, 40 (13 percent) of the 300 surviving patients
were classiﬁed as much better, 33 (11 percent) as better,
163 (54 percent) as unchanged, 39 (13 percent) as
worse, and 25 (8 percent) as much worse (P ϭ 0.009).
The difference between the groups remained signiﬁcant
(P ϭ0.04) in a multivariable model in which we controlled
for potentially confounding base-line characteristics of the
patients. Lengths of stay and hospital charges were similar in the two groups.
Fewer patients assigned to the intervention group were
discharged to long-term care institutions (43 patients [14
percent], as compared with 67 patients [22 percent] in the
usual-care group; P ϭ 0.01). Among the 493 patients discharged to private homes, similar proportions (about 10
percent) in the two groups were admitted to long-term
care institutions during the three months after discharge.
Conclusions. Speciﬁc changes in the provision of
acute hospital care can improve the ability of a heterogeneous group of acutely ill older patients to perform
basic activities of daily living at the time of discharge from
the hospital and can reduce the frequency of discharge to
institutions for long-term care. (N Engl J Med 1995;332:
1338-44.)

T

ence and institutionalization.12-15 Many interventions designed to improve the outcomes of acutely ill elderly patients have had disappointing results.15-21
We used complementary principles of quality improvement and comprehensive geriatric assessment to
develop a new system of care for acutely ill older patients in our hospital.3,22 This program, which we call
Acute Care for Elders, is designed to help patients
maintain or achieve independence in basic activities of
daily living through the combined effects of four key elements: a specially designed environment, patient-centered care, planning for discharge, and review of medical care (Table 1).22 In order to carry out the speciﬁc
nursing protocols and to facilitate the work of an interdisciplinary team, our teaching hospital instituted this
program in a single 14-bed unit.

HERE is heightened interest today in improving
the outcomes in a variety of groups of patients.1-3
Most recent efforts to improve patients’ outcomes, however, have focused on speciﬁc diseases,4,5 treatments,6-8
or behavior of physicians.9,10 We evaluated a clinical
system of care designed to improve overall outcomes in
a heterogeneous group of older adults who were hospitalized for acute illnesses.
Patients 65 years of age or older account for 31 percent
of acute care hospital admissions in the United States
and 45 percent of hospital expenditures for adults.11
These older patients are at high risk for loss of independFrom the Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Care Research

METHODS
From November 1990 through March 1992, we compared the outcomes of patients treated in this special unit with those of patients
who received usual care at the University Hospitals of Cleveland, a
private, nonproﬁt teaching hospital afﬁliated with Case Western Reserve University that has 874 beds.
During the study period, 1794 patients who were 70 or older were
admitted for general medical care. Patients who were admitted to a
specialty unit (e.g., intensive care, cardiology–telemetry, or oncology)
were ineligible for the study (n ϭ 2067). We randomly assigned 651
of the 1794 eligible patients either to the Acute Care for Elders pro-

ILLUSTRATIVE FEATURES

Carpeting, handrails, uncluttered hallways
Large clocks and calendars
Elevated toilet seats and door levers
Daily assessment by nurses of physical, cognitive, and
psychosocial function
Protocols to improve self-care, continence, nutrition,
mobility, sleep, skin care, mood, cognition (implemented by the primary nurse and based on the daily
assessment)
Daily rounds by the multidisciplinary team, led by the
medical and nursing directors with the primary
nurse, social worker, nutritionist, physical therapist,
and visiting-nurse liaison
Early, ongoing emphasis on the goal of returning home
Assessment of plans and needs for discharge by a nurse
at the time of admission
Early involvement of a social worker and home health
care nurse, if indicated
Daily review by the medical director of medicines and
planned procedures
Protocols to minimize the adverse effects of selected
procedures (e.g., urinary catheterization) and medications (e.g., sedative–hypnotic agents)

gram (n ϭ 327) or to usual care (n ϭ 324) in another general medical
unit; the remaining 1143 eligible patients were not enrolled in the
study because beds were not available in both the intervention and
usual-care units at the time of their admission. Assignment according
to computer-generated random numbers was performed at the time
of admission by the admitting clerk. Informed consent was obtained
orally from patients or their proxies (usually family members), according to procedures approved by the hospital’s institutional review
board.
Patient Care
In both the intervention and usual-care units, each patient was assigned a primary nurse, two resident physicians, and an attending
physician. The intervention and usual-care units had the same hospital-supported staff-to-patient ratios (roughly one budgeted position
for a registered nurse for each two beds) and used the same hospitalwide support services (for example, social work, physical therapy,
and nutrition). Extramural grant support provided funds for increases in hours worked in the intervention unit by the medical and nursing directors, social worker, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and dietitian; these fractional increases totaled less than one
additional full-time person per year. Under the leadership of the
medical and nursing directors, the primary nurse assigned to each
patient in the intervention group was responsible for assessing the
patient’s speciﬁc needs daily and implementing protocols for the prevention of disability and for rehabilitation.
Usual care consisted of services provided by physicians and nurses
in other acute care medical units. The staff of the intervention unit
was not involved in the care of patients receiving usual care, and
none of the four elements of the program were implemented in usualcare units. However, attending physicians and resident physicians
provided care to patients in both the intervention and usual-care
groups.
Sources of Data
Data were obtained by means of interviews and from medical records. On admission, interviews were attempted with each patient, the
patient’s primary nurse, and a family member or other care giver.
The patient and nurse were also interviewed at the time of discharge,
and the patient and a family member or care giver were contacted
three months after discharge. The interview covered sociodemographic characteristics, the ability to function in performing activities
of daily living,23,24 the ability to walk, overall health status, the items
on a geriatric depression scale,25 and the ﬁrst 21 items of the Mini–

1339

Mental State Examination.26 The ﬁve basic activities of daily living
that were included in the study were bathing, dressing, using the toilet, moving from a bed to a chair, and eating23; continence was not
included because it is not reported as reliably as the other self-care
activities.27 The seven instrumental activities of daily living were
shopping, cooking, performing household chores, using transportation, managing money, managing medication, and using the telephone.24 On admission, patients and family members were asked
about the patients’ functional status and overall health two weeks before admission and at the time of admission. Three months after discharge, information was obtained about any stays in long-term care
facilities, readmissions to a hospital, and health care services by paid
providers at home.
All interviews were conducted by research assistants who were not
involved in patient care. These interviewers received standardized
training consisting of a written protocol, scripted scenarios, role playing, and observed interviews. Standardization of interviews was
maintained during the study by weekly reviews of interview procedures. Interviewers were not blinded to the patients’ group assignments. Interrater reliability for data obtained by the interviewers was
assessed for 10 hospitalized patients (1.5 percent). The mean kappa
statistics were 0.98 for the basic activities of daily living, 0.94 for the
instrumental activities of daily living, 0.96 for the mental-status
items, and 0.99 for items related to depression.
Clinical data were obtained from medical records. These included
the reason for hospitalization,28 the Charlson comorbidity score,29
and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)
II score30 on the day of admission.
Data on each patient’s hospital charges as reported to the Health
Care Financing Administration on the Universal Bill-1982, a standard billing form, were obtained from the hospital. Actual hospital
costs, as estimated by the hospital’s cost-accounting system, were
available for 601 patients and correlated highly with charges (r ϭ 0.96).
The results of analyses of hospital costs and charges were similar and
are not reported separately. We estimated the cost of the additional
staff time paid for by the grant and the capital costs of special features of the intervention unit, which were not included in hospital reports of charges or costs.
Missing Data
Interview data were obtained primarily from the patients; 461 (71
percent) were interviewed on admission, 403 of the 603 surviving patients (67 percent) at discharge, and 328 of the survivors (63 percent)
three months after discharge. When information about function was
not available from the patients, data from proxy respondents were
used; the primary nurse was the source of proxy data obtained at admission and discharge, and a family member or care giver was the
source of preadmission and post-discharge data. Only patients’ reports were used for the assessment of mental status and mood.
Statistical Analysis
The main outcome variable was the change from admission to discharge in the number of basic activities of daily living that the patients could perform independently. The patient’s functional status at
discharge was classiﬁed as better if the number of activities he or she
could perform independently increased from admission to discharge,
and worse if this number decreased. Changes from two weeks before
admission to discharge were calculated similarly.
We examined differences between the intervention and usual-care
groups in base-line characteristics, main end points and other outcomes at discharge, hospital charges and length of stay, and outcomes after discharge. Differences between the groups in the change
in the ability to perform activities of daily living independently were
evaluated with the chi-square test for linear trend.31 The results of
ridit analyses32 conﬁrmed those of the chi-square tests for linear
trend and are not reported separately. We used the Wilcoxon ranksum test to assess differences in continuous variables and the chisquare test for categorical variables, with the modiﬁcation for linear
trend when appropriate.31 The consistency of differences between the
intervention and usual-care groups was examined in subgroups deﬁned by several clinical characteristics: age, ability to perform basic
and instrumental activities of daily living two weeks before admis-

sion, comorbidity score, and APACHE II
score at admission. Stratiﬁed and multivariable ordinal logistic-regression analyses were
used to control for potentially confounding
factors.31,33 All statistical tests were two-sided, with P ϭ 0.05 as the criterion to indicate
statistical signiﬁcance.

RESULTS
On admission, the patients randomly assigned to the intervention
group were similar to those assigned
to receive usual care in most sociodemographic characteristics, healthstatus measures, chief reasons for
admission, and coexisting illnesses
(Table 2). Forty-eight of the 651 patients (7 percent) died in the hospital — 24 patients each in the intervention and usual-care groups.
Outcomes at Discharge

At the time of hospital discharge,
65 (21 percent) of the 303 surviving
patients in the intervention group
were classiﬁed as much better in
terms of their ability to perform basic activities of daily living, 39 (13
percent) as better, 151 (50 percent)
as unchanged, 22 (7 percent) as
worse, and 26 (9 percent) as much
worse. In the usual-care group, 40
(13 percent) of the 300 surviving
patients were classiﬁed as much better, 33 (11 percent) as better, 163
(54 percent) as unchanged, 39 (13
percent) as worse, and 25 (8 percent) as much worse (P ϭ 0.009)
(Fig. 1). The ﬁndings were similar
(P ϭ 0.009) in an analysis limited to
the 382 patients who provided complete information about their functional status at both admission and
discharge.
The mean numbers of basic activities of daily living that could be
performed independently at hospital
discharge were 3.6 for the intervention group and 3.3 for the usualcare group (P ϭ0.05). At discharge,
the intervention group also had
a higher level of function in the
basic activities of daily living than
they did two weeks before discharge
(P ϭ0.05) (Fig. 1). Thirty-six (12
percent) of 297 patients in the intervention group were better or much
better, 171 (58 percent) had no
change, and 90 (30 percent) were
worse or much worse, as compared
with 16 (6 percent) of 285 patients

Figure 1. Change in Patients’ Ability to Perform Basic Activities of Daily Living from Admission to Discharge and from Two Weeks
before Admission to Discharge, According to Treatment Group.
The ﬁve basic activities of daily living we studied were bathing, dressing, using the toilet, moving from a bed to a chair, and eating.
“Much better” indicates an increase of two or more in the number of basic activities a patient could perform independently, “better”
indicates an increase of one, “worse” indicates a decrease of one, and “much worse” indicates a decrease of two or more. The lefthand panels show the changes from admission to discharge for the 603 patients who survived to discharge. For 382 patients, the data
were obtained from interviews with the patient at both admission and discharge; for 221 patients, data missing from the interviews
were obtained from the patient’s primary nurse at admission or discharge. The right-hand panels show the changes from two weeks
before admission to discharge for the 582 patients who survived to discharge for whom data on function two weeks before admission
were available. Differences between the treatment groups were tested with the chi-square test for linear trend.

better or much better, 168 (59 percent) who had no
change, and 101 (35 percent) who were worse or much
worse.
Table 3 shows the changes from hospital admission
to discharge in the number of activities of daily living
that could be performed independently by different
groups of patients. In the intervention group, beneﬁts
were seen for patients less than 80 years old (P ϭ 0.03),
those who were able to perform independently fewer
than ﬁve basic activities of daily living two weeks before admission (P ϭ 0.04), and those with APACHE II
scores of 0 through 14 (P ϭ 0.02). Trends toward a beneﬁt were seen in other groups.
In a multivariable ordinal logistic-regression model
controlling for age, sex, race, the number of basic and
instrumental activities of daily living the patient was
able to perform independently two weeks before admission, and each of ﬁve characteristics measured on admission (overall health status and APACHE II score,
Charlson comorbidity score, mental-status score, and
depression score), we found that an increase in the
number of activities of daily living performed independently from admission to discharge was independently associated (P ϭ0.04) with assignment to the inter-

vention program. A parallel analysis limited to the 382
patients who provided complete data on their functional status both at admission and at discharge had similar results (data not shown).
With regard to changes from admission to discharge
in the ability to perform individual activities of daily living, more patients assigned to the intervention group
improved, and fewer became worse, in their ability to
bathe and dress themselves (P ϭ 0.006 and P ϭ 0.02, respectively). More patients in the intervention group
than in the usual-care group showed improvement in
their ability to move from a bed to a chair and to use
the toilet, but these differences were not signiﬁcant
(P ϭ 0.2 and P ϭ 0.3, respectively).
Fewer patients assigned to the intervention group
were discharged to a long-term care institution (43 patients [14 percent], as compared with 67 patients [22
percent] in the usual-care group; P ϭ 0.01) (Table 4).
Among the 555 patients admitted to the hospital from
private homes who survived to discharge, fewer patients assigned to the intervention group than to the
usual-care group were discharged to long-term care institutions for the ﬁrst time (9 percent vs. 16 percent,
P ϭ 0.02). Among the 493 patients discharged to private

homes, similar proportions of the intervention and usual-care groups were discharged with plans for new paid
health care at home, such as the services of a nurse,
homemaker, or health aide (43 percent vs. 41 percent,
P ϭ 0.6).
Overall health status at discharge was better
(PϽ0.001) for patients assigned to the intervention
group (Table 4); this difference remained signiﬁcant
after we controlled for overall health status at admission in a stratiﬁed analysis (P ϭ 0.01). In the intervention group, there was a trend toward greater improvement during hospitalization in the patients’ ability to
perform instrumental activities of daily living (P ϭ0.06)
and in their ability to walk (P ϭ 0.10) (Table 4). The
patients in the intervention group had a lower mean depression score at discharge than those in the usual-care
group (Table 4). The two groups did not differ signiﬁcantly, however, after we controlled for depression
scores on admission in a multivariable linear regression
analysis (P ϭ 0.3). Mental status at discharge was similar in the two groups (Table 4).
Resources Used in the Hospital

⌻he mean length of the hospital stay was 1 day shorter for patients assigned to the intervention group (7.3,
as compared with 8.3 days for the usual-care group),
but the median length of stay was the same (6 days) for

*Data were missing for some patients, as follows: overall health status, 90 patients; instrumental activities of daily living, 21 patients; ability to walk independently, 5 patients; depression score, 259 patients; and mental-status score, 273 patients. Because of rounding, percentages do not always total 100.
†Long-term care institutions included skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation hospitals, and
other institutions providing assistance with daily activities.
‡Patients who could perform more of the seven instrumental activities of daily living at discharge than at admission were classiﬁed as having better function, those who could perform
the same number as unchanged, and those who could perform fewer as worse. The instrumental
activities of daily living are listed in a footnote to Table 2.
§Patients who could not walk independently on admission but could do so at discharge were
classiﬁed as better, and those who could walk independently on admission but not at discharge
were classiﬁed as worse. Other patients’ status was unchanged.

each group (P ϭ 0.4). Mean total hospital charges were
$10,289 for patients in the intervention group, as compared with $12,412 for patients who received usual
care; the median hospital charges were $7,057 and
$7,839, respectively (P ϭ0.3; 95 percent conﬁdence interval for the difference between groups, Ϫ$1,212 to
$392). The cost of additional hours worked by clinical
personnel for the 17-month intervention period totaled
$65,000. Capital costs allocated to the intervention
group for the special features of the unit totaled
$10,500. The total costs not reﬂected in hospital charges were thus approximately $75,500, or $231 for each of
the 327 patients assigned to the intervention program.

*Patients whose function was classiﬁed as better were able to perform independently more
of the ﬁve basic activities of daily living at the time of discharge than at the time of admission,
those with unchanged function could perform the same number at both times, and those whose
function was classiﬁed as worse could perform fewer at discharge than on admission. Because
of rounding, percentages do not always total 100. Results are not shown but were similar for
patients with Charlson comorbidity scores of 0–2, those with Charlson comorbidity scores у3,
those who could perform 0, 1, or 2 instrumental activities of daily living independently two
weeks before admission, and those who could perform у3 instrumental activities two weeks
before admission. Information was available on basic and instrumental activities of daily living
performed two weeks before admission for 582 patients and on Charlson comorbidity scores
and APACHE II scores for 592 patients.

Outcomes and Use of Resources during the Three Months
after Discharge

During the three months after discharge, 82 patients
died — 42 (14 percent) assigned to the intervention
group and 40 (13 percent) assigned to the usual-care
group; 6 patients (1 percent) were lost to follow-up.
Three months after discharge, the intervention and
usual-care groups did not differ signiﬁcantly in the
mean number of basic activities of daily living the patients could perform independently (4.0 and 3.8, re-

IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES OF ACUTELY ILL OLDER PATIENTS

spectively; Pϭ0.3), the mean number of instrumental
activities of daily living they could perform independently (3.9 and 3.8, respectively; Pϭ0.5), or overall
health status as reported by the patients or proxy respondents (Pϭ0.5).
Among the 493 patients discharged to private homes,
similar proportions of the intervention and usual-care
groups were admitted to long-term care institutions
during the three months after discharge (24 of 260 patients [9 percent] vs. 23 of 233 patients [10 percent],
respectively). Fewer patients assigned to the intervention group lived in long-term care institutions at any
time during the three months after discharge (67 patients, vs. 90 patients in the usual-care group; Pϭ0.03)
(Table 4). Among the 603 patients who survived to discharge, similar numbers in the intervention and usualcare groups were readmitted to acute care hospitals
during the three months after discharge (104 of 303 patients [34 percent] vs. 109 of 300 patients [36 percent],
respectively; Pϭ0.6), and similar numbers received
paid health care services from nurses, health aides, or
homemakers (158 of 303 patients [52 percent] vs. 143
of 300 patients [48 percent]; Pϭ0.3).
DISCUSSION
This randomized trial provides evidence that specific changes in the provision of acute hospital care can
improve the ability of a heterogeneous group of older
patients hospitalized with acute illnesses to perform
basic activities of daily living at the time of discharge.
More patients assigned to the intervention group — as
opposed to those who received usual care — improved
from admission to discharge in their ability to perform
basic activities of daily living, and fewer became worse,
despite their somewhat shorter hospital stays and shorter time for recovery before discharge. Other differences
observed at discharge were consistent with this main
ﬁnding, and the differences between the groups remained signiﬁcant in multivariable and stratiﬁed analyses in which we controlled for potentially confounding
base-line characteristics of the patients. Fewer patients
assigned to the intervention group were discharged to
long-term care institutions or lived in them during the
three months after discharge. For every 15 patients
treated in the intervention unit, 1 more patient was returned home than from the usual-care units, and 1 less
patient was admitted to a long-term care institution.
The beneﬁcial effects we observed were apparently
achieved without increasing in-hospital or post-discharge costs. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize
that the functional status of the majority of patients in
both groups was unchanged or worse at the time of
discharge. Three months after discharge, the groups
did not differ signiﬁcantly in terms of their ability
to perform basic or instrumental activities of daily
living.
Comparison with Past Studies

Despite the dramatic beneﬁts of geriatric evaluation
and management at the end of acute care hospital stays
for at least some patients,34,35 consultative and unitbased interventions to improve the functional outcomes

1343

of acutely ill hospitalized older persons have had little
beneﬁt.15,17-21,36-43 The intervention we studied differed
from most earlier interventions in several ways, notably
by incorporating the physical redesign of the hospital
unit, the key role assigned to nurses in initiating assessment and case management, and the scheduling of daily rounds by a multidisciplinary team. Two earlier
studies44,45 also involved nurse-initiated interventions;
both of these studies found evidence of beneﬁcial effects.
Methodologic Considerations

We recognize potential limits to the validity of our
ﬁndings. The impracticality of blinding patients and interviewers to the treatment assignments may have biased the reports of outcomes. To obtain reports about
health status for all patients, proxy reports were required in many cases, and reports from patients and
proxies may differ.27,46 Nonetheless, several factors support the validity of our ﬁndings. Different outcome
measures consistently indicated that the intervention
had a beneﬁcial effect. The better function in the intervention group than in the usual-care group at the time
of discharge was consistent in subgroup and multivariable analyses. Finally, bias in the design and conduct of
the study was reduced by the random assignment of
patients, the use of measures with established validity
and reliability, and the complete follow-up data for the
main outcome variable.
Our study was designed to test the efﬁcacy of the
Acute Care for Elders program as a whole, rather than
to determine the relative efﬁcacy of its different components, its cost effectiveness, or its long-term effects.
Further evaluation will be necessary to address these
issues and to test the effectiveness of this approach in
other settings.
Implications

The loss of functional independence is not an inevitable consequence of acute illness and hospitalization
among older patients. The intervention we studied can
serve as a model for improving aspects of overall function — indicated by the ability to care for oneself —
that are not speciﬁcally related to a particular disease
or treatment. Although functional outcomes are rarely
the focus of conventional medical care, they may be
critical determinants of the quality of life, independence, cost of care, and prognosis among older patients.46-48 Functional outcomes are especially important in acutely ill, hospitalized older patients, who are
often frail, chronically ill, and at high risk for functional decline and institutionalization for long-term
care.12,14,48 Furthermore, an intervention program such
as ours does not preclude, and may complement, disease-speciﬁc or treatment-speciﬁc efforts to improve
patients’ outcomes.4-8,49
