Background: The transcription factors SREBP1 and SCAP are involved in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.
Polymorphisms of these genes have been associated with variations on serum lipid levels and response to
statins that are potent cholesterol-lowering drugs. We evaluated the effects of atorvastatin on SREBF1a and
SCAP mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and a possible association with gene
polymorphisms and lowering-cholesterol response.
Methods: <n>Fifty-nine</n> hypercholesterolemic patients were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/day for 4 weeks).
Serum lipid proﬁle and mRNA expression in PBMC were assessed before and after the treatment. Gene
expression was quantiﬁed by real-time PCR using GAPD as endogenous reference and mRNA expression in
HepG2 cells as calibrator. SREBF1 -36delG and SCAP A2386G polymorphisms were detected by PCR-RFLP.
Results: Our results showed that transcription of SREBF1a and SCAP was coordinately regulated by
atorvastatin (r = 0.595, p b 0.001), and that reduction in SCAP transcription was associated with the 2386AA
genotype (p = 0.019). Individuals who responded to atorvastatin with a downregulation of SCAP had also a
lower triglyceride compared to those who responded to atorvastatin with an upregulation of SCAP.
Conclusion: Atorvastatin has differential effects on SREBF1a and SCAP mRNA expression in PBMC that are
associated with baseline transcription levels, triglycerides response to atorvastatin and SCAP A2386G
polymorphism.

1. Introduction
Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors that play important roles in lipid metabolism and homeostasis mainly by activation of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in
liver [1,2]. SREBPs belong to the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper
family and are encoded by SREBP1 and SREBP2 genes (SREBF1 and
SREBF2, respectively) that share 47% homology [3]. SREBF1 contains 2
promoters that generate 2 transcripts, SREBF1a and SREBF1c, by
alternative splicing at the ﬁrst exon [4].
SREBP1a is a potent activator of all SREBP-responsive genes, including those that mediate the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids,
and triglycerides. The roles of SREBP1c and SREBP2 are more restricted
than that of SREBP1a. SREBP1c preferentially enhances transcription
of genes required for fatty acid synthesis, while SREBP2 activates
cholesterol synthesis [1].
SREBPs are bound to endoplasmic reticulum membrane and remain
inactive when the intracellular cholesterol content is high. Reduction of

intracellular cholesterol by sterol starvation or treatment with lowering-cholesterol drugs triggers the translocation of the SREBPs from
the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi by the SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP), a sensor of the cholesterol intracellular concentration [5]. This displacement is escorted by 2 chaperons Insig-1 and
Insig-2 that are proteins tightly bound to the endoplasmic reticulum [6,7].
SREBPs are further sequentially cleaved by Site-1 (SP1) and Site-2
(SP2) proteases and its NH2-terminal domain (bHLH-Zip) is released
and translocated into the nucleus where it binds to sterol regulatory
elements (SREs) at the promoter region of target genes and activates
their transcription. SREBPs act coordinately with additional transcription factors to achieve full activation of target genes [2,8].
The primary targets of the SREBP1 are genes encoding for enzymes
involved in lipid metabolism, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl
coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), low-density lipoprotein receptor
(LDLR) [9] and others [1].
HMGCR has a key role in cholesterol synthesis and its activity is
inhibited by statins that are potent cholesterol-lowering-drugs [10]. It
has been shown that the response to statins are highly variable and
affected by several factors including polymorphisms in genes involved
in drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters as well as in proteins
related to the lipid metabolism [11–15].

Despite the increasing number of pharmacogenetic studies on
statins, only few investigations have addressed the involvement of
gene polymorphism in the intracellular homeostasis of cholesterol.
SREBF1 gene has an indel polymorphism in the promoter region
(-36del/G) that was associated with an atherogenic lipid proﬁle and
increased risk for cardiovascular disease [16]. SREBF1 -36delG variant
was also related to variation on plasma apoA-I in response to ﬂuvastatin [17] but not simvastatin [18]. A common polymorphism of the
SCAP gene (A2386G, Ile796Val), located at its carboxyl terminal domain that interacts with SREBP1 [19], was found to be a signiﬁcant
predictor of cholesterol and triglyceride responses to simvastatin [18],
but not to pravastatin therapy [20].
Besides the evidences of these pharmacogenetic studies, the
pharmacogenomic mechanisms of response to statins are yet unclear. It has been demonstrated that atorvastatin regulates gene
expression in blood leukocytes before changes in the lipid proﬁle
are detectable in serum [21]. Recently, we have demonstrated that
atorvastatin inhibits ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette B1) expression in
blood mononuclear cells from hypercholesterolemic individuals with
hypercholesterolemia and in HepG2 cells [22]. Moreover, freshly
isolated blood mononuclear cells have been used as a surrogate for
the cardiovascular tissue to study the correlation between gene expression and atherosclerosis severity [23]. Therefore blood leukocytes seem to be an interesting model to study the statin effects
on gene expression in vivo, and may be useful as a biomarker to
evaluate pharmacological response. In the present study, we investigated the effects of atorvastatin on expression of SREBF1a and
SCAP transcripts in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and their
possible association with gene polymorphisms and loweringcholesterol response.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Subjects and blood samples
We selected 59 unrelated Brazilian outpatients (18 men and 41 women, aged 31 to
77 y) with primary hypercholesterolemia (HC) from those admitted to the University
Hospital of the University of Sao Paulo (Sao Paulo City, Brazil) between January 2005
and December 2006. Subjects were European (67.8%) and African descent (32.2%),
inhabitants of the Sao Paulo city (Southern Brazil).
Individuals with gastrointestinal, thyroid, liver or renal disease, diabetes, familial dyslipidemia, triglycerides N 4.4 mmol/l or under treatment with lipid-lowering
drugs, hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives were not included in this
study.
The HC patients were oriented to follow a low fat diet according to American Heart
Association step one diet [24] during 4 weeks. Those with LDL cholesterol N4 mmol/l
were treated with atorvastatin 10 mg orally once daily during 4 weeks. Before and after
atorvastatin therapy, all patients were evaluated for serum concentrations of lipids,
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK). No signiﬁcant variations on
ALT and CK serum activities were found in HC patients during atorvastatin treatment.
This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of the University Hospital
and Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences of the University of Sao Paulo and all
participants gave written informed consents.
2.2. Biochemical analysis
Antecubital venous blood was collected after a 12-h overnight fast and samples
were centrifuged within 3 h from being drawn. Serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol
and triglycerides were determined by enzymatic methods and serum ALT and CK were
measured by kinetic assays using the Advia®1650 analyzer (Siemens Medical/Bayer
Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY). Serum LDL and VLDL cholesterol were calculated [25].
Plasma apoAI and apoB were determined by nephelometry. AIP is a logarithmically
transformed ratio of molar concentrations of triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol. AIP and
ApoB/ApoAI ratio have been used for evaluation of the risk for cardiovascular disease
[26,27].
2.3. Genomic analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA-anticoagulated blood by a salting-out
procedure [28]. SREBF1 and SCAP polymorphisms were determined by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment analysis. For SREBF1 -36delG variant we
used the sequences of primers previously described [16]. For SCAP A2386G polymorphism the primers sequences were: 5′-TTCTGCAGGACATCGACTG-3′ (forward) and
5′-AGAAGGGCAAGGGAAAAG-3′ (reverse).

PCR assays were performed with 50 ng genomic DNA, 200 nmol/l primers
(Invitrogen, Brazil), 200 mmol/l dNTPs (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech do Brasil, Brazil),
1 U DNA polymerase and PCR buffer [75 mmol/l Tris HCl (pH 9,0), 50 mmol/l KCl,
2 mmol/l MgCl2, 20 mmol/l (NH4)2SO4] (Biotools, Spain). PCR conditions for SREBF1
polymorphism were: one cycle at 98 °C for 3 min; 32 cycles at 96 °C for 1 min, at 60 °C
for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. For SCAP polymorphism
the conditions were: one cycle at 96 °C for 3 min; 38 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, at 58 °C
for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and once cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. Ampliﬁcations were
carried out in a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research, Waltham MA). PCR products were
analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis after ethidium bromide staining.
PCR products of SREBF1 (464 bp) and SCAP (342 bp) were digested with 30 U Apa I
and 2 U HpyCH4 IV, respectively, at 37 °C for 4 h. Restriction fragments were detected by
2% agarose and 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively for SREBF1 and
SCAP fragments, after ethidium bromide staining. Apa I recognizes one restriction site
that generates 131 and 333 bp fragments for G+ allele and 464 bp for G− allele. HpyCH4
IV recognizes one constitutive site (152 bp) and one polymorphic site that generate a
190 bp fragment for A allele and 123 and 67 bp fragments for G allele.
2.4. Cells and culture
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated as previously described
[29] and immediately used for RNA extraction. HepG2 cells were used as calibrator for
gene expression studies. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 2 mmol/l glutamine, 44 mmol/l sodium bicarbonate, 10.000 U/ml
streptomycin and 10.000 U/ml penicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere, containing 5% CO2. Culture medium was replaced twice a week and cells
were trypsinized and sub-cultured every 7 days.
2.5. mRNA expression by real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from PMBC and HepG2 cells (1 × 106 to 5 × 106) using
TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described
[29]. cDNA was produced from 1 μg of total RNA by Superscript™ II Reverse Transcriptase and SREBF1a and SCAP mRNA were measured by TaqMan real-time PCR assay,
using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) as reference gene, and mRNA
from HepG2 cells was used as calibrator.
The PCR assays were carried out in 96-well plates using a 7500 Real-Time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR protocol consisted of 40 cycles at
95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. The primers and probes sequences used for
SREBF1a, SCAP and GAPD mRNA detection were obtained in “Assay on demand” format
(Applied Biosystems).
The relative quantiﬁcation value of each target gene was analyzed using a
comparative Ct method [30,31]. The following formula was used to calculate the relative
amount of the transcript in the sample and normalized to the GAPD as endogenous
reference: 2−ΔΔCt, where ΔCt is the difference in Ct between the gene of interest and
GAPD, and ΔΔCt for the sample = mean ΔCt of sample − mean ΔCt of the HepG2 cells. The
gene expression was interpreted as the increase or reduction in relative mRNA levels
after atorvastatin therapy.
2.6. Statistical analysis
The statistical calculations were carried out using SigmaStat Software 2.03 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL). Categorical variables were compared by chi-square test or Exact Fisher
test. Chi-square analysis also was used to test Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). For
SREBF1 -36Gdel variant, individuals carrying G+G−/G−G− genotypes were grouped and
compared with those carrying G+G+ genotype. For SCAP A2386G variant, individuals
carrying AA genotype were compared with the AG/GG genotypes carriers. Differences
on biochemical data and gene expression before and after atorvastatin treatment were
compared by Paired t-test. The results from the effects of SREBF1 and SCAP polymorphisms on biochemical data and gene expression were evaluated by student t-test.
For data without normal distribution the Mann Whitney and Wilcoxon tests were used.
Correlation analyses were performed by Pearson correlation coefﬁcient. Statistical
signiﬁcance was established at the p b 0.05 level.

3. Results
3.1. Patient data
The demographic, clinical and laboratory data of the individuals
with hypercholesterolemia (HC) are summarized in Table 1. The study
group was predominantly comprised of Caucasian-descent women.
Hypertension, obesity and tobacco consumption were found in 49.2%,
28.8%, and 23.7% patients, respectively. These patients had an
atherogenic serum lipid proﬁle, including values of the apolipoprotein
B (apoB) to apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) ratio (0.37) and atherogenic
index of plasma (AIP) (1.08) that indicate high risk for CAD [24,25]. The
family history for CAD was found in 55.9% patients.

In this sample, the frequencies of SREBF1 -36delG allele and SCAP
2386G alleles were 45.8% and 54.2%, respectively (Table 2). These
results are similar to that found in other populations (SREBF1: 51%–
63%; SCAP: 43%–53%) [16,18,19,32,33].
3.2. Effects of atorvastatin on gene expression
SREBF1a and SCAP mRNA were differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HC individuals in response
to atorvastatin. As shown in Fig. 1a, atorvastatin increased mRNA
expression in patients with low baseline levels (SR1) and reduced in
those with high baseline levels (SR2) (p b 0.001). The patterns of SCAP
baseline expression (low: SC1, high SC2) were also related to the
differential expression response to atorvastatin (Fig. 1b). Despite these
differences, there was a positive correlation between the variations
of SREBF1a and SCAP expression levels in response to atorvastatin
(r = 0.595, p b 0.001) (Fig. 2).

serum triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol response were signiﬁcantly
lower in SC2 (2.9%) group when compared with SC1 group (18.2%,
p=0.041) (Fig. 3b).
3.4. SREBF1 and SCAP variants and gene expression

3.3. Gene expression and serum lipid proﬁle in response to atorvastatin
Anthropometric data, serum lipid proﬁle and allele frequencies of
polymorphisms were compared between the patients with different
SREBF1a and SCAP baseline expression patterns, but the differences
were not signiﬁcant (Table 3). Similar results were found when individuals with low SREBF1a and SCAP mRNA levels (SR1/SC1, n = 13)
were compared with those with high expression levels (SR2/SC2,
n = 23) (p N 0.05) (data not shown). These data are suggestive that
baseline expression levels of these genes are not related to the lipidemic status, SREBF1 and SCAP polymorphisms, or other studied
variables of the hypercholesterolemic patients.
Atorvastatin reduced serum level of total cholesterol (28.0%±8.9%), LDL
cholesterol (37.8%±11.7%), HDL cholesterol (6.0%±10.5%), VLDL cholesterol (9.3% ± 28.2%), triglycerides (9.3% ± 28.2%) and apoB (25.6% ±
30.2%) and increased apoAI (10.0%±36.8%). This pattern of response was
similar between SR1 and SR2 groups (pN 0.05) (Fig. 3a). On the other hand,

As shown in Fig. 4a, baseline SREBF1a mRNA expression of SR1 in
PBMC did not differ between individuals carrying genotype SREBF1
G+G+ and the G+G−/G−G− genotypes carriers (p N 0.05). Baseline levels
of SCAP transcripts were also similar between individuals carrying
SCAP AA and AG+GG genotypes (Fig. 4b). There was also no relationship between baseline expression patterns and allele frequencies

for both SREBF1 (χ2 = 5.989, p = 0.05), and SCAP (χ2 = 1.945, p = 0.378)
polymorphisms.
Following treatment with atorvastatin, SCAP 2386AA genotype
carriers showed a signiﬁcant reduction (5 times) in SCAP transcripts
(p = 0.019) (Fig. 4b). However, this effect was not observed in AG+GG
genotype carriers (Fig. 4b) or those carrying different SREBF1 -36delG
genotypes (Fig. 4a).

but no associations were found between these combined genotypes
and serum lipids before and after atorvastatin therapy (data not
shown).
4. Discussion

Baseline levels of serum lipids and apolipoproteins were similar
between SREBF1 and SCAP genotypes. Serum lipids response to atorvastatin was also not associated with SREBF1 or SCAP variants (Table 4).
We have also evaluated the SREBF1 and SCAP combined genotypes

This study examined the effects of atorvastatin on PBMC mRNA
expression of genes involved in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis
and its relation with serum lipid proﬁle and genetic polymorphisms.
The expression patterns of both SREBF1a and SCAP showed signiﬁcant
variations before and after treatment with atorvastatin.
Baseline levels of SREBF1a transcript has been also measured in
PBMC of normolipidemic individuals and it seems to be positively
correlated with the transcription levels of SREBF1c and other genes

involved in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis [34]. In human
cultured cells, addition of sterols to the media suppressed SREBP1
suggesting that SREBF1a transcription is also controlled by metabolic
factors [35]. Nevertheless, we did not ﬁnd relationship between
SREBF1a expression status and serum lipids.
A variable pattern of SREBF1a and SCAP transcription in response
to atorvastatin was found in PBMC. This differential pattern may
result from variation in intracellular cholesterol since sterols block
the SCAP-escorted SREBPs transport from endoplasmic reticulum to
the Golgi [36]. This mechanism may explain the upregulation of
atorvastatin on SREBF1a and SCAP mRNA expression found in SC1 and
SR1 groups. However, the mechanism of the atorvastatin-induced
downregulation of the SREBF1a and SCAP transcript levels in SR2 and
SC2 groups remains to be elucidated. It is possible that this effect is
secondary to the atorvastatin-induced downregulation of SREBF1a
expression found in SR2 individuals, considering that 39% (23/59) HC
patients had concomitant reduced expression of both genes. Moreover, the positive correlation between the variations on SREBF1a and
SCAP transcription levels suggests that these genes are coordinately
regulated by atorvastatin.
In this study, lower serum triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol
response to atorvastatin was associated with signiﬁcant reduction of
SCAP mRNA expression in PBMC (group SC2). These results suggest
that atorvastatin effects on SCAP expression may reﬂect the intracellular homeostasis of triglycerides and its circulating levels.
Atorvastatin and simvastatin in high doses up regulate SREBP1 and
enzymes involved in VLDL production such as fatty acid synthase
(FAS), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, DAG acyltransferase and
microsomal triglycerides transfer protein in rat liver [37]. However,
both statins markedly reduced plasma triglycerides levels, suggesting
that different mechanisms may be involved in the hypotriglyceridemic
effect of statins at high or low doses. On the other hand, triglycerides
inhibit expression of SRE-promoter genes that is positively correlated
with cell triglycerides accumulation [38]. Therefore, triglycerides
similar to fatty acids are rapid and efﬁcient modulators of SREmediated gene expression.
We have demonstrated that SREBF1 -36delG polymorphism is not
associated with the levels of mRNA expression in the presence or

absence of atorvastatin. Although this polymorphism is located close
to the second Sp1 site of the promoter region [39], it seems to have no
effect in transcription regulation at least in PBMC.
The common A2386G polymorphism of SCAP was associated with
mRNA expression in response to atorvastatin. Individuals carrying AA
genotype had signiﬁcant reduction of SCAP transcription levels. The
role of this variant on gene expression remain to be investigated. We
speculate that it may be in linkage disequilibrium with the loss-offunction C-11T promoter polymorphism that was associated with a
marked reduction in promoter activity in a luciferase-based expression system [40]. Mutations in the sterol sensing domain of SCAP were
found to abolish the feedback regulation of SREBP processing by
sterols [41]. These mutations may be also associated with differential
pattern in SCAP mRNA expression.
Despite of the relationship of SREBF1 -36delG and SCAP A2386G
polymorphisms on serum lipids in response to ﬂuvastatin and
simvastatin reported previously [17,18], we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant
association between these variants and response to atorvastatin.
These results are suggestive that polymorphisms in SREBF1 and SCAP
may play a minor role in determining the pharmacological response to
statins. It is noteworthy that SREBP1 and SCAP are key modulators of
the HMGCR and LDLR expression in cells, therefore polymorphisms
that inﬂuence gene expression may affect the pharmacodynamics and
consequently the pharmacological effects of statins without determining signiﬁcant variation in serum lipids. In addition, differences in
pharmacokinetics of statins and metabolic status of the patient may
also contribute to the variation in lowering-lipid responses among
SREBF1 and SCAP genotypes carriers.
A potential limitation of our study is the relative small number of
cases for genotype-association analyses. Therefore the effect of
SREBF1 and SCAP variants on statins response should be tested in
larger populations for better evaluation of the pharmacogenetics role
of these potent lowering-cholesterol medicines.
In conclusion, atorvastatin has differential effects on SREBF1a and
SCAP mRNA expression in PBMC that depends on baseline transcription levels and SCAP A2386G polymorphism. Reduction of SREBF1a
and SCAP expression was associated with lower triglycerides response
to atorvastatin.
