Objective: In a previous randomized
controlled study, the authors reported significant beneficial effects of cognitive
therapy for relapse prevention in bipolar
disorder patients up to 1 year. This study
reports additional 18-month follow-up
data and presents an overview of the effect of therapy over 30 months.
Method: Patients with DSM-IV bipolar I
disorder (N=<n>103</n>) suffering from frequent
relapses were randomly assigned into a
cognitive therapy plus medication group
or a control condition of medication only.
Independent raters, who were blind to
patient group status, assessed patients at
6-month intervals.
Results: Over 30 months, the cognitive
therapy group had significantly better
outcome in terms of time to relapse.
However, the effect of relapse prevention
was mainly in the first year. The cognitive
therapy group also spent 110 fewer days

(95% CI=32 to 189) in bipolar episodes
out of a total of 900 for the whole 30
months and 54 fewer days (95% CI=3 to
105) in bipolar episodes out of a total of
450 for the last 18 months. Multivariate
analyses of variance showed that over the
last 18 months, the cognitive therapy
group exhibited significantly better mood
ratings, social functioning, coping with bipolar prodromes, and dysfunctional goal
attainment cognition.
Conclusions: Patients in the cognitive
therapy group had significantly fewer
days in bipolar episodes after the effect of
medication compliance was controlled.
However, the results showed that cognitive therapy had no significant effect in
relapse reduction over the last 18 months
of the study period. Further studies
should explore the effect of booster sessions or maintenance therapy.

I

n the last few years, evidence for the efficacy of psychotherapy specific for bipolar disorder is emerging (1–3). We
recently reported a randomized controlled study of a relapse prevention approach that showed significant beneficial short-term effects of cognitive therapy for up to 1
year (4). Over the 12-month period, the cognitive therapy
group had significantly fewer bipolar episodes, fewer days
in bipolar episodes, and fewer bipolar admissions. The
cognitive therapy group also had significantly higher social functioning and showed less mood symptoms on the
monthly mood questionnaires. However, given the frequent relapsing nature of bipolar disorder (5, 6), a longerterm follow-up period is of paramount importance if cognitive therapy is to be a successful form of treatment. Furthermore, cognitive therapy traditionally has a large skill
acquisition component. If therapy results in skill acquisition, it should delay or prevent relapses. Hence, a longerterm follow-up period will provide an estimate of the enduring effect of cognitive therapy.
The purpose of this article is to report an additional 18
months of follow-up data for the original treatment trial,
resulting in a total of 30 months of data (6 months of treatment and 2 years of follow-up evaluations). Apart from important clinical data such as bipolar episodes, the length of
episodes, and social functioning, we also report changes in

coping with bipolar prodromes and in cognitive dysfunctional beliefs.
Our primary hypotheses were as follows:
1. Relative to subjects in a control condition, patients
assigned to cognitive therapy would have fewer bipolar episodes and fewer days in bipolar episodes.
2. Relative to subjects in a control condition, patients
assigned to cognitive therapy would have higher social functioning, better coping strategies for bipolar
prodromes, and lower dysfunctional high goal attainment attitudes.
Our secondary hypotheses were that compared with
subjects in a control condition, patients assigned to cognitive therapy would have lower depression and mania
mood scores and show better medication compliance.

Method
Procedure and Assessment
After the study had been fully explained, written informed consent was obtained. Patients who were found suitable for the study
were randomly allocated either to the control condition (N=52) or
to the cognitive therapy group (N=51). The computer-generated
allocation sequence was concealed in sequentially numbered
and sealed opaque envelopes. Patients in the control condition

received “minimal psychiatric care,” which was defined as mood
stabilizers at a recommended level according to the British National Formulary, with regular psychiatric follow-up as outpatients. The cognitive therapy group received on average 13.9 sessions (SD=5.5) of cognitive therapy plus “minimal psychiatric
care” over 6 months.
Independent assessors blind to patient group status assessed
patients at 6-month intervals with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (7) to determine DSM-IV bipolar episodes. The other instruments used in the interview were
the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (8), Bech-Rafaelsen Mania
Rating Scale (9), Coping With Bipolar Prodromes Schedule (10),
and the Social Functioning Schedule (11). Patient descriptions of
coping with bipolar prodromes were transcribed verbatim. Raters
blind to patient group status and time of interview rated patients’
ability to cope with bipolar prodromes. Interrater reliability was
good (mania prodromes: kappa=0.69, SE=0.13; depression prodromes: kappa=0.79, SE=0.03). Patients also completed the
Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (12) and a medication compliance
schedule every 6 months. Patients’ key workers were also asked
to fill in the medication compliance schedule to obtain collateral
reports of patient drug compliance.

Individual Cognitive Therapy
Cognitive therapy was defined by our cognitive therapy treatment manual (13), the new elements of which include 1) using a
diathesis-stress model emphasizing the need for combined medication and psychological therapies; 2) the use of cognitive therapy skills to monitor prodromes and to modify behavior to prevent prodromal stages from developing into full-blown episodes;
3) promoting the importance of regular sleep and routine; and
4) targeting extreme striving attitudes and behavior. The four
therapists were clinical psychologists (three male and one female) with a minimum of 5 years of postqualification experience.
All therapy sessions were audiotaped for weekly peer supervision,
which lasted an hour. Therapy consisted of 12–18 individual sessions within the first 6 months and two booster sessions in the
second 6 months. In reality, therapy lasted about 6 months. Patients in the cognitive therapy group had an average of 13.9 sessions (SD=5.5). Eight patients terminated cognitive therapy prematurely before the sixth session (mean number of sessions=2.6,
SD=1.8). All patients in the inadequate treatment group were included in “intent-to-treat” analyses whenever possible.

Patients
Patients in this study fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder. In order to identify a subgroup vulnerable to relapse, patients also had to have had at least two episodes in the last 2 years
or three episodes in the last 5 years prior to recruitment. The only
two exclusion criteria were actively suicidal (score of 3 on the
Beck Depression Inventory suicide item) or currently fulfilling
criteria for a substance use disorder. The characteristics of the
subjects in the cognitive therapy and control condition groups
are summarized in Table 1.

Instruments
1. The Mania Rating Scale (9) consists of 11 items that reflect
common manic symptoms such as motor activity, flight of
thoughts, voice/noise level, and amount of sleep. Each item
is rated on a 5-point scale. A total score of 0–5 is interpreted
as no mania; 6–9=hypomania (mild); 10–14=probable mania; ≥15=definite mania. The scale has good interrater reliability and construct validity.
2. For the Coping With Bipolar Prodromes Schedule (10), patients were asked, from their experience of past episodes,
what the early warnings (prodromes) were that made them
think they were “going either high or low” and what they did

when they had these prodromes. Patient reports of prodromes and the way they coped with them for both depression and mania were recorded verbatim. Coping was rated
on a 7-point scale (0=poor; 3=adequate; 6=extremely well).
3. The Social Functioning Schedule (11) is an observer-rated
scale based on a semistructured interview with patients
that provides a quantitative assessment of social performance in the last month. The interview is directed toward
actual behavior and performance over eight areas of social
performance, each rated on a 4-point scale. In the original
paper, the authors reported a better than chance interrater
agreement. The interrater reliability in this study ranged
from kappa of 0.91 to 0.76 for the different areas of social
functioning with 10 training cases. A slightly modified version of the schedule was used to interview key relatives of
the patients.
4. The short version of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale for Bipolar Disorder (12) consists of 24 items. It is derived from a
principal component analysis study that used 143 patients
with bipolar I disorder in which three factors were derived.
Factor 1, “goal attainment,” accounted for 25.0% of the total
variance. Factor 2, “dependency,” accounted for 11.0% of
the total variance. Factor 3, “achievement,” accounted for
8.2% of the total variance. The goal attainment subscale was
thought to capture the highly motivated attitudes in the
cognitive model for bipolar affective disorder.
5. The medication compliance questionnaire reported compliance with any prescribed mood stabilizers. Respondents
had a choice of noting whether the patient in the past month
had 1) never missed taking their medication, 2) missed taking
it once or twice, 3) missed taking it between three to seven
times, 4) missed taking it more than seven times, or 5) stopped
taking it altogether (14).

Data Analysis
Differences between the cognitive therapy and control conditions were assessed by a chi-square test for dichotomous variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables. Cox regression was used for survival analysis, with the number of weeks

to the first bipolar episode as the dependent variable. Logistic regression was used to compare the proportions of patients who relapsed in the two groups. Where applicable, adjustments for differences in the relevant measures at baseline were carried out by
analysis of covariance or logistic regression. The main outcomes,
which were continuous scales, were tested for group differences
by using a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), covarying for the same variables measured at baseline. Univariate
tests were carried out to identify the dependent variables that
contributed most to the significant omnibus test. All analyses
were on an intent-to-treat basis, and all p values were two-tailed.

Results
Survival Analysis
Figure 1 depicts the survival curves of the two groups
over the 30-month period for bipolar episodes. The actuarial cumulative relapse rates for patients in the cognitive
therapy and control conditions, respectively, were 63.8%
(N=30 of 47) and 84.3% (N=43 of 51) for bipolar episodes,
50.0% (N=23 of 46) and 67.4% (N=31 of 46) for manic/hypomanic episodes, and 38.6% (N=17 of 44) and 66.7% (N=
32 of 48) for depressive episodes. After controlling for the
previous number of episodes and medication compliance
during the whole 30 months, the between-group differences were significant for bipolar episodes (hazard ratio=
0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.29–0.85; p<0.02) and
depressive episodes (hazard ratio=0.38, 95% CI=0.19–0.75;
p<0.006). However, the difference was not significant for
manic/hypomanic episodes (hazard ratio=0.71, 95% CI=
0.38–1.35; p=0.30).

Days in Bipolar Episodes
Table 2 summarizes the mean number of days that patients in the cognitive therapy and the control condition
groups were in an illness episode during the additional 18
months of the study and over the whole 30-month followup period. During the additional 18 months, after the
number of previous episodes and medication compliance
over 30 months were controlled, the intent-to-treat analyses showed that the cognitive therapy group had significantly fewer days in bipolar episodes than the control condition group.

Clinical Ratings

Bipolar Episodes Over the Last 18 Months

There were significant correlations between the total
raw scores of the Social Functioning Schedule and Hamilton depression scale at month 18 (r=0.65, df=77, p<0.02),
month 24 (r=0.62, df=67, p<0.02), and month 30 (r=0.53,
df=61, p<0.02). Moreover, there were significant correlations between ratings for coping with mania prodromes
and total score on the Social Functioning Schedule at
month 18 (r=–0.26, df=72, p<0.05), month 24 (r=–0.33, df=
67, p<0.02), and month 30 (r=–0.29, df=69, p<0.05). Ratings
for coping with depression prodromes and coping with
mania prodromes also correlated significantly at month
18 (r=0.68, df=74, p<0.02, two-tailed), month 24 (r=0.71,
df=68, p<0.02), and month 30 (r=0.54, df=75, p<0.02).

Over the 18-month follow-up period, there was a nonsignificant difference between the cognitive therapy and control condition groups in the proportion of subjects who
had at least one relapse (57.8% [N=26 of 45] and 69.6% [N=

prodromes at months 18, month 24, and month 30 were
analyzed in a MANCOVA to test for differences between the
two groups. The scores of these same variables at baseline
plus patient reports of medication compliance and number of previous episodes were used as covariates. The omnibus test for group differences was significant (Wilks’s
lambda=0.18, f=3.12, df=18, p<0.03). Table 3 summarizes

in the dropout rates between patients who were prescribed
one or two mood stabilizers or antipsychotics or no antipsychotics at any time point throughout the study.

There was no statistically significant difference in the
mean number of psychiatric appointments during the last
18 months (cognitive therapy group: mean=7.2 [SD=5.7];
control condition group: mean=7.4 [SD=7.3]). According
to self reports, the cognitive therapy group was significantly more compliant with medication than the control
condition group at month 24 (mean=1.4 [SD=0.9] versus
2.2 [SD=1.5], respectively; t=–2.3, df=32.2, p<0.05) and at
month 30 (mean=1.5 [SD=0.9] versus 2.2 [SD=1.3]; t=1.9,
df=35.3, p<0.05). At month 18 the difference was in the
predicted direction but not statistically significant (cognitive therapy group: mean=1.5, SD=0.9; control condition
group: mean=1.7, SD=1.2). There was a significant correlation between reports of key workers and patients (r=0.60,
df=52, p<0.01).

Discussion
In a previous study (4), we reported that patients assigned to cognitive therapy fared significantly better than
subjects in a control condition in terms of relapse and
days in a bipolar episode over the first 12 months of the
study. Taking the 30 months as a whole, patients in the
cognitive therapy group did significantly better in actuarial cumulative relapse rates than those in the control condition, even when the number of previous episodes and
medication compliance were controlled. When the episodes were divided into depression and mania/hypomania, the differences were significant for depression but not
for mania/hypomania. This is similar to the initial analysis
of Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy, which found a
significant effect in preventing depression symptoms but
not manic symptoms (5). However, the overall effect of relapse prevention was strongest during the first 12 months
of the 30-month study period. This included 6 months of
therapy and the following 6 months. There was no evidence that cognitive therapy had a significant effect in
preventing relapse over the last 18 months. The effect was
less robust as therapy became more distant. Maintenance
therapy in cognitive therapy (15) and interpersonal therapy (16) has been found to be beneficial in unipolar de-

328

pression. Our findings suggest that some form of maintenance therapy may be helpful to boost the beneficial effect
of cognitive therapy.
However, the number of patients who had suffered from
a bipolar episode cannot be the sole outcome measure. The
length of bipolar episodes can vary. Bipolar patients can
suffer from chronic depression that lasts for months as opposed to short manic episodes that last a couple of weeks.
Hence, the duration in which patients are in episodes is an
important outcome. As in the first 12 months, the cognitive
therapy group had significantly fewer days in bipolar episodes over the last 18 months of the study period.
Patients in the cognitive therapy group performed consistently equal to or better than subjects in the control
condition in terms of mood ratings, social functioning,
coping with bipolar prodromes, and dysfunctional goal attainment cognition over the last 18 months of the study.
The omnibus test for group differences was significant. In
our previous report, patients in the cognitive therapy
group exhibited significantly better coping strategies for
mania and depression prodromes at the end of therapy
(4). In this follow-up study, the cognitive therapy group
showed a tendency to report better coping strategies over
the last 18 months of the study and significantly better
coping with depression and mania prodromes at month
24. Highly driven and extreme goal attainment beliefs
were identified as potential vulnerability factors (7) for extreme goal-pursuing behavior, which would disrupt sleep
and daily routines and lead to more episodes. In this study,
therapists targeted these attitudes. There was a vigorous
attempt to challenge these beliefs, and the cognitive therapy group scored significantly lower in these dysfunctional beliefs at 6 and 18 months.
The beneficial effects for the cognitive therapy group
could not be attributed to more frequent psychiatric outpatient appointments and the medication prescribed to
patients. There were no significant differences between

tients in the cognitive therapy group were prescribed two
mood stabilizers than patients in the control condition.
Both patient and clinician reports suggest that patients in
the cognitive therapy group were more compliant with
medication than those in the control condition. However,
this higher level of compliance or the number of previous
episodes may not account entirely for the treatment benefits in the cognitive therapy group, since we controlled for
the number of previous episodes and medication compliance throughout the study period for all major outcomes.
There are four limitations of our follow-up study. First,
we did not control for the extent of pharmacological or
psychological treatment over the follow-up period. Four
patients in the control condition received psychological
therapy during the follow-up period, although none of the
cognitive therapy group received additional psychotherapy. However, the aim of the study was to test the beneficial effects of adding cognitive therapy to a commonly
used regimen of pharmacotherapy for bipolar disorder patients. Second, there was a lack of control for nonspecific
effects of therapy. Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that the advantageous effect of cognitive therapy was
due to attentional effect. Third, the assessment of relapse
status was carried out every 6 months. Depression and hypomanic symptoms between the assessments could have
been missed. Hence, it was difficult to exclude the possibility that cognitive therapy eliminated bipolar episodes
by shifting patients from clinical episodes to more subtle
pathological states. Last, we did not measure systematically subjects’ adherence to circadian-rhythm-related
routines.
Overall, our study showed that cognitive therapy can
prevent relapses in a group of bipolar disorder patients
who had experienced frequent relapses despite the prescription of mood stabilizers. Furthermore, there was
some evidence that patients who had received therapy
had higher social functioning and coped better with bipolar prodromes throughout the study period. Taken together, the findings of this study support the conclusion
that cognitive therapy is a worthy addition to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of bipolar affective disorder, particularly for those who suffer from frequent relapses despite the use of mood stabilizers. However, the effect was
strongest during the 6 months when patients were receiving cognitive therapy and the 6 months following therapy.
As therapy became more distant, the beneficial effect became weaker. Further study should explore the effect of
maintenance therapy or booster sessions.
