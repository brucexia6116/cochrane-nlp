Objective: The effect of risperidone augmentation of citalopram for relapse prevention
in older patients with antidepressant-resistant depression was evaluated. Methods:
Patients with major depression aged Ն55 years who had failed at least one adequate
trial of an antidepressant received citalopram monotherapy (20 – 40 mg) for 4 to 6
weeks to confirm nonresponse (Ͻ50% reduction in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
[HAM-D] scores). Those who achieved remission (HAM-D score Յ7 or Clinical Global
Impressions severity score 1 or 2) after 4 to 6 weeks of open-label risperidone augmentation (0.25–1 mg) then entered a 24-week double-blind maintenance phase during
which they received citalopram augmented with risperidone or placebo. Results: The
patients’ mean age was 63.4 Ϯ 7.9 years; 58% were women; 61% had received two or
more antidepressants during the current episode; 93 met the criterion for citalopram
nonresponse and entered open-label risperidone augmentation. Of the 89 patients who
completed risperidone augmentation, 63 achieved symptom resolution and entered the
6-month double-blind maintenance phase: 32 received risperidone augmentation and 31
received placebo augmentation. The median time to relapse (Kaplan-Meier estimates)
was 105 days in the risperidone group and 57 days in the placebo group (Wilcoxon ␹2:
3.2, dfϭ1, p ϭ 0.069). Overall, 18 of 32 (56%) from the risperidone group and 20 of 31
(65%) from the placebo group relapsed. Treatment was well tolerated. Conclusion: In
older patients with resistant depression and poor response to standard treatments,
risperidone augmentation resulted in symptom resolution in a substantial number of patients and a nonsignificant delay in time to relapse. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2008; 16:21–30)

Relapse Prevention With Risperidone

A

recent consensus statement identiﬁed mood
disorders as a signiﬁcant health care issue in the
elderly that are associated with suffering, functional
decline, compromised quality of life, caregiver burden, and increased rates of suicide and service utilization.1 Persistent depression worsens the outcomes
of many comorbid medical disorders prevalent in the
elderly and increases nonsuicide-related mortality.2,3
Despite recent advances in pharmacotherapy and
psychotherapy, only one-third of depressed older
adults achieve remission and another 20% have partial improvement.4 Drug-resistant depression remains a signiﬁcant public health problem with profound effects on health care costs.5
A combination of an atypical antipsychotic and an
antidepressant appears to be one of the alternatives
in the acute treatment of severely depressed patients
who have failed to respond to pharmacotherapy.6
Once a patient improves, the clinician is left with the
task of determining whether and for how long to
continue the antipsychotic agent during continuation
and maintenance treatment. In the case of older
adults who are at high risk for tardive dyskinesia
and other side effects, this decision depends on the
advantage that combined treatment offers compared
with continuing an antidepressant alone.
To inform this decision, we compared the efﬁcacy
and safety of continuation treatment with combined
citalopram and risperidone with those of citalopram
alone in older depressed patients with drug-resistant
depression who improved after acute treatment with
the combination of citalopram and risperidone. We
focused on risperidone because there is evidence that
risperidone augmentation of antidepressants may be
an effective acute treatment in unipolar and bipolar
major depression resistant to antidepressant
drugs.7–9 Furthermore, a nine-month study of mixedage adults suggests that risperidone may be more
effective in relapse prevention than citalopram
alone.10 The present analysis uses data from the
study of a mixed-age population and focused on
patients aged 55 years and older.

tant depression was conducted at 57 centers in four
countries (Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and
the United States) from June 2002 through January
2004. The study was approved by the institutional
review boards of each center and all subjects gave
written informed consent. The subjects of the present
subgroup analyses were the 110 patients aged Ն55
years. The study had three phases: 1) open-label
citalopram monotherapy for 4 to 6 weeks to conﬁrm
treatment nonresponse; 2) open-label risperidone
augmentation of citalopram for 4 to 6 weeks to identify responders to this treatment (i.e., those with
symptom resolution) and thus eligible for continuation treatment during the double-blind phase; and 3)
double-blind continuation treatment with the combination of risperidone and citalopram or citalopram
alone for 24 weeks to assess its efﬁcacy on relapse
prevention and safety (Fig. 1). A detailed description
of the study has been published elsewhere.10

Patient Selection
The subjects selected for this analysis were inpatients or outpatients, aged Ն55 years, meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth
Edition (DSM–IV) diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, single or multiple episode, with or
without psychotic features, and with a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score
Ն20 and a Mini-Mental State Examination score Ͼ23.
The diagnoses were made at each site by experienced
clinicians based on a comprehensive assessment of
the patient. Subjects were required to have a history
of resistance to standard antidepressant treatment,
deﬁned as failure to respond to at least one but no
more than three antidepressants during the current
episode, administered at adequate doses for a minimum of 6 consecutive weeks (doses of the antidepressive medication within ranges approved by the
Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
depression). Patients with comorbid medical illnesses were included except for those with severe
and unstable cardiovascular, kidney, liver, or neurological diseases. Patients with dementia and all other
DSM–IV axis 1 diagnoses, except generalized anxiety
disorder and phobias, were excluded from the study.
A complete medical history was obtained from each
subject and each received a physical examination
and laboratory evaluation. Subjects who were medically healthy and those who had stable medical
conditions were eligible to participate in the study.

Phase 1: Acute Citalopram Treatment
The purpose of this open-label phase was to establish resistance to an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in patients with a prior history of drug treatment failure during the index episode. Citalopram
was started at 20 mg/day and targeted to 40 mg/
day. The treatment lasted six weeks or four weeks for
patients who were unchanged or worse after four
weeks of treatment. Patients nonresponsive to citalopram in phase 1 (Ͻ50% reduction in HAM-D
scores at endpoint) were included in phase 2. Relapse
rates were also identiﬁed in patients who were fully
nonresponsive to citalopram (Ͻ25% reduction in
HAM-D scores at endpoint).

Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 16:1, January 2008

Phase 2: Acute Treatment With Citalopram
Augmented With Risperidone
Phase 2 consisted of open-label combination treatment of citalopram and risperidone for patients who
failed to respond to citalopram during phase 1. Citalopram was kept at the dose received at the endpoint
of phase 1. The risperidone augmentation dose was
started at 0.25 mg/day and targeted to 0.5 mg/day
(0.25–1 mg/day permitted). Its goal was to identify
patients who achieved remission (HAM-D score Յ7
or a Clinical Global Impressions [CGI] severity score
of 1 or 2) during combination treatment and thus
became candidates for continuation treatment offered in phase 3. The duration of phase 2 was four
weeks or, at the discretion of the investigator, six
weeks for patients who showed clinical improvement but had not yet achieved remission.
Phase 3: Continuation Treatment With a
Combination of Citalopram and Risperidone or
Citalopram and Placebo
Patients who met criteria for remission after acute
combination treatment with citalopram and risperidone during phase 2 were randomly assigned to continue treatment with the same combination or citalopram combined with placebo for 24 weeks. Patients
either continued to receive the ﬁxed dose of citalopram
and risperidone of phase 2 or citalopram at the dose of
phase 2 and placebo (risperidone was discontinued).
Relapse was deﬁned as any of the following occurring at any single time point: 1) substantial clinical
deterioration as indicated by a CGI-change score of 6
(much worse) or 7 (very much worse); 2) HAM-D
scoreՆ16; 3) discontinuation due to lack of therapeutic effect; or 4) deliberate self-injury or suicidal intent.

OUTCOME MEASURES
The primary measure of efﬁcacy during the doubleblind maintenance study was the time to relapse.
Safety evaluations included assessments of movement disorders (Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale)
and reports of adverse events. Efﬁcacy measures
during the open-label phases included the HAM-D
˚
and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale

23

Relapse Prevention With Risperidone
(MADRS). Assessments were performed at regular
intervals throughout all study phases. Details on the
schedule of assessments are reported elsewhere.10

RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING
Randomization sequences were generated by an independent statistician. The randomization for the
overall study was noncentralized and stratiﬁed by
site, age (18 –54 and 55– 85 years), and presence of
psychotic features. Blinded treatment codes were assigned using an automated interactive voice response system. The double-blind integrity was maintained through database lock.

to open-label citalopram monotherapy; and 2) a linear
regression model comparing the slopes (improvement
rates) in MADRS scores during the open-label citalopram monotherapy and risperidone augmentation
phases. In the regression model, the MADRS total score
was used as the dependent variable and time (e.g., days
0, 14, 28, 42) was the independent variable for each
subject. The slope from this regression was considered
an estimate of the subject’s “average” rate of change in
MADRS total score per day. Paired t-tests were used to
determine the difference in slopes (improvement rates)
between two open-label phases and the mean changes
from baseline in each phase.

RESULTS
DATA ANALYSIS
The primary analysis of the overall study that included
both the older and younger adults was powered to
detect between-treatment differences in the entire
study sample. The present subanalysis was planned to
investigate outcomes in the older group of patients.
While age was included as a stratiﬁcation factor in the
randomization scheme for the double-blind phase, the
study was not powered to detect between-treatment
differences in this subgroup. A post-hoc power calculation was performed for the Kaplan-Meier estimates of
the time-to-event (relapse) in the two treatment groups.
Subjects of the efﬁcacy analyses for each phase consisted of all enrolled patients who had received at least
one postbaseline efﬁcacy assessment. Subjects of the
safety analyses consisted of all enrolled patients who
had received at least one dose of any study medication.
The last available evaluation for each patient deﬁned
the endpoint analyses (last observation carried forward). The baseline for each subsequent phase was the
last observation of the preceding phase. Analysis of
covariance, with treatment and country as independent
factors and respective baseline scores of each scale as
covariate, was used to compare treatments on continuous variables. Categorical variables were evaluated
using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratifying by
country. Time to relapse was compared between
groups using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Two posthoc analyses were performed: 1) analysis of patients
considered fully nonresponsive (Ͻ25% improvement)

24

A total of 108 patients entered phase 1 and received
at least one dose of open-label citalopram and had
one efﬁcacy evaluation (Fig. 1). Phase 1 was completed by 101 patients and 93 met the nonresponse
criterion (Ͻ50% reduction in HAM-D scores) and
received risperidone and citalopram for four to six
weeks in phase 2. Of the 93 patients who entered
phase 2, 68% (63 of 93) met the criterion for remission. All 63 patients elected to enter the 24-week
double-blind maintenance study (phase 3).
The baseline characteristics of the patients who
entered phase 3 were similar to those of the 108
patients who entered phase 1 (Table 1). A comorbid
disease was identiﬁed in 62 of the 63 patients who
entered the double-blind maintenance study. These
included a musculoskeletal disorder in 53%, cardiovascular in 52%, neurologic in 45%, and gastrointestinal in 40%. Concomitant medications that ﬁve or
more of these patients were receiving included benzodiazepines and related drugs by 24, acetaminophen by 17, acetylsalicylic acid by 13, ibuprofen or
naproxen by 11, ace inhibitors by 10, sulfonamides
by 10, statins by 9, proton pump inhibitors by 9, estrogens by 8, antihistamines by 7, thyroid hormones by 7,
corticosteroids by 6, and glucocorticoids by 5.
Antidepressants received for Ն6 weeks prior to
study entry by 5% or more of the 108 patients who
entered phase 1 were venlafaxine by 36%, sertraline
by 21%, mirtazapine by 20%, ﬂuoxetine by 19%, paroxetine by 19%, bupropion by 10%, amitriptyline by
7%, citalopram by 7%, and trazodone by 5%.

Phases 1 and 2
During open-label citalopram monotherapy (phase 1),
the mean (ϮSD) modal dose of citalopram was 34.6 Ϯ
11.5 mg/day. During risperidone augmentation of citalopram (phase 2), the mean modal doses were 0.7 Ϯ 0.3
mg/day of risperidone and 39.3 Ϯ 7.5 mg/day of citalopram. MADRS scores were signiﬁcantly reduced
from baseline at each time point during citalopram
monotherapy and risperidone augmentation (Fig. 2).
The difference in improvement rates (as measured by
the slopes in Fig. 2) observed during the two open-label
phases was signiﬁcant (t ϭ 8.1, dfϭ92, p Ͻ0.001). In
phase 1, the improvement in MADRS total score was at
a mean (ϮSD) rate of approximately 0.07 Ϯ 0.41 points
per day (i.e., 2.9 points over the entire 6 weeks), whereas
in phase 2 the improvement was approximately 0.43 Ϯ
0.31 points per day (i.e., 18.1 over the entire 6 weeks).
Mean HAM-D and MADRS scores in all study
phases are shown in Table 2.
Double-Blind Maintenance Study

receiving risperidone and citalopram (phase 2), 32 were
randomized to continuation treatment with risperi-

Mean (ϮSD) modal doses were 0.8 Ϯ 0.3 mg/day of
risperidone and 40.0 Ϯ 8.8 mg/day of citalopram in the
risperidone/citalopram group and 40.5 Ϯ 6.3 mg/day
of citalopram in the placebo/citalopram group.
Attrition
Three patients in the risperidone group and four in
the placebo group discontinued treatment for reasons other than relapse. Reasons were adverse events
in two patients of each group, consent withdrawal in
one patient of each group, and insufﬁcient response
in one placebo patient.
Relapse
The median time to relapse was 105 days in the 32
patients receiving risperidone augmentation and 57
days in the 31 patients receiving placebo augmentation
(Wilcoxon ␹2: 3.2, dfϭ1, pϭ0.069; Fig. 3). The power to
detect between-group differences was only 46%, assuming patients were followed for 180 days and a
constant proportion of patients at risk would discontinue at each time point. The relapse rate was 56% (18

65% (20 of 31) in the placebo plus citalopram group. An
analysis of the numbers needed to treat to prevent
relapse indicates that, over three to six months, risperidone augmentation would result in one less relapse for
approximately every seven to nine patients treated.
In the 40 patients who were fully nonresponsive to
citalopram in phase 1 (Ͻ25% reduction in HAM-D
scores at endpoint), the median time to relapse was 142
days in the risperidone plus citalopram group and 35

(17 of 25) in the placebo plus citalopram group.

ness and dry mouth during risperidone augmentation (Table 3). In the double-blind maintenance
study, the only adverse event reported in more than
two patients of either group was headache (in three
risperidone patients). No deaths or cerebrovascular
events were reported in these patients.
Mean scores on the Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes
Akathisia Scale, and Abnormal Involuntary Movement
Scale were low at baseline and tended to be further
reduced during all three phases (Table 4). There was a
mean (ϮSD) reduction in body weight of 0.3 Ϯ 2.3 kg
during citalopram monotherapy (phase 1), an increase
in body weight of 0.9 Ϯ 2.1 kg during risperidone
augmentation (phase 2), and mean changes of ϩ0.8 Ϯ
3.5 kg in the risperidone group and Ϫ0.3 Ϯ 2.8 in the
placebo group in the maintenance study.

DISCUSSION
Older patients with a history of antidepressant-resistant major depression who received continuation

Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 16:1, January 2008

treatment with risperidone and citalopram had a
median time to relapse of 105 days, compared with
57 days in patients treated with placebo and citalopram. Although the difference was not statistically
signiﬁcant, it may be suggestive. This ﬁnding is consistent with the between-treatment difference in time
to relapse in the total sample of the original study
which comprised 241 adults aged 18 to 87 years.10
Approximately 40% of patients who received continuation treatment with risperidone and citalopram
and approximately 30% of the patients who received
placebo augmentation remained relapse-free for six
months. These may be underestimates since the single time-point criterion for relapse is perhaps too
stringent for an illness with a chronically ﬂuctuating
course. Additionally, the lack of a stabilization phase
in patients who met criteria for remission may have
permitted entry into the double-blind phase of patients with an unstable remission. In any event, keeping 40% of depressed older patients with a history of
antidepressant resistance relapse-free for 24 weeks
(compared with 30% with placebo) may be an im-

monotherapy and the subsequent augmentation of
citalopram with risperidone. Symptom resolution
was attained by 68% of patients during risperidone
augmentation. The citalopram monotherapy phase
was too short to establish whether improvement in
depression during risperidone augmentation was in
response to the addition of risperidone or further
exposure to citalopram. However, the mean rate of
improvement was approximately 6 times greater
during risperidone augmentation than during citalopram monotherapy (Fig. 2), suggesting that the response during risperidone augmentation may not
have been simply due to continued citalopram treatment or regression to the mean. These post-hoc ﬁndings require prospective conﬁrmation in a controlled
study.
The efﬁcacy of risperidone augmentation in the
acute and the continuation treatment phases is consistent with clinical studies suggesting that addition
of atypical antipsychotics to antidepressants can be
beneﬁcial in major depression.12,13 Preclinical reports
indicate that risperidone and other atypical antipsychotics modulate the monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems thought to be involved in antidepressant
mechanisms.14 –16 Thus a potential mechanism of risperidone’s augmentation of citalopram may be increases in norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine
activity. The present ﬁndings indicate a possible role
for risperidone in the large older population of patients with drug-resistant nonpsychotic depression.
A limitation of this subgroup analysis is that only
about one-third of the patients were aged Ն65 years.
Their characteristics, however, are similar to those of
previous studies of older patients with treatmentresistant depression.11,17 The mean duration of ill-

ness (2 years) in these patients coupled with the
retrospective and prospective history of treatment
failure point to the chronic nature of their illness.
Treatment augmentation with risperidone was
safe and well tolerated and was not accompanied by
movement disorders or signiﬁcant extrapyramidal
signs or changes in body weight. However, the continuation phase of this study was short and cannot
establish the long-term safety of risperidone augmentation of antidepressants in older patients. At
best, the ﬁndings of this study suggest that risperidone added to citalopram is a therapeutic alternative
in attempting to stabilize treatment-resistant depression in older adults who are in remission after risperidone augmentation.

CONCLUSION
In this population of older patients with resistant
depression and poor response to antidepressants,
risperidone augmentation resulted in remission in
68% of patients and a statistically nonsigniﬁcant but
perhaps clinically meaningful delay in time to relapse. The ﬁndings in the older subgroup of patients
are consistent with those in the total study sample.10
Risperidone augmentation was well tolerated in
these older patients, many of whom had comorbid
illnesses and were receiving co-medications. The results suggest that risperidone augmentation is one of
the treatment alternatives for these very difﬁcult to
treat patients.
