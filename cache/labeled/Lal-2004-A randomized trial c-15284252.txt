Purpose
Irinotecan given until disease progression is an accepted standard treatment for advanced colorectal
cancer (CRC) resistant to ﬂuoropyrimidines. It is not known whether a predeﬁned period of irinotecan
treatment would result in similar duration of disease control. We performed a multicenter phase III trial
to compare the two policies of deﬁned-duration versus continuous irinotecan treatment.
Patients and Methods
<n>Three hundred thirty-three</n> eligible patients with advanced CRC progressing on or within 24 weeks of
completing ﬂuoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy were prospectively registered. After receiving eight
cycles of irinotecan given at 350 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks, 55 patients with responding or stable
disease were randomly assigned to stop irinotecan (n ϭ 30) or continue until disease progression
(n ϭ 25). Registered patients were not randomly assigned predominantly due to disease progression (n ϭ 236) and intolerable toxicity (n ϭ 38).
Results
From the time of random assignment, there were no differences in failure-free survival (P ϭ .999) or
overall survival (P ϭ .11) between the two arms. No difference was seen in mean global health status
quality-of-life score between the two arms at 12 weeks after random assignment. No grade 3 diarrhea
and febrile neutropenia was seen in the continue-irinotecan arm after random assignment.
Conclusion
For most patients, the decision to continue on irinotecan beyond 24 weeks is inﬂuenced by disease
progression or treatment-related toxicity. However, for 17% of patients in whom this decision is clinically
relevant, there seems to be little beneﬁt from continuing irinotecan, though the drug was well tolerated
without any deterioration in quality of life.

INTRODUCTION

In advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), patients with access to ﬂuoropyrimidines, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin can achieve a
median survival of 18 to 22 months.1,2 The
role of irinotecan was ﬁrst established in
patients with ﬂuoropyrimidine-refractory
CRC, with two randomized studies demonstrating survival beneﬁt over best supportive
care3 or alternative continuous infusion of
ﬂuorouracil (FU)4 in this group of patients.
In both studies, irinotecan was given until

disease progression. Subsequently, the combination of irinotecan with FU and leucovorin (LV) produced superior survival
compared with FU/LV in a ﬁrst-line setting,5,6 and led to irinotecan becoming the
standard of care in ﬁrst-line treatment of
metastatic CRC. In addition, oxaliplatin/infused FU/LV (FOLFOX) has recently been
shown to have a survival advantage over irinotecan/bolus FU/LV (IFL),1 and similar efﬁcacy
to irinotecan/infused FU/LV (FOLFIRI).2 Oxaliplatin combination has therefore also become standard of care in the ﬁrst-line setting.

Whereas the issue of treatment duration has been addressed in many adjuvant studies in CRC,7-9 only one randomized study evaluated two policies of a deﬁned treatment
period of 12 weeks, compared with treatment until disease
progression in patients receiving ﬁrst-line treatment.10 No
studies have evaluated whether continuous treatment with
irinotecan until disease progression is superior to a deﬁned
period of treatment in the second-line setting in terms of
survival or quality of life (QoL). In this prospective study,
we compared the two policies of continuous treatment until
disease progression, with a deﬁned duration of eight cycles
of irinotecan monotherapy, given every 3 weeks.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
This phase III multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial
recruited patients from six oncology centers in the United Kingdom. The eligibility criteria included: locally advanced or metastatic histologically proven CRC that progressed on or within 24
weeks of FU, raltitrexed, or oral ﬂuoropyrimidine– based chemotherapy; WHO performance status (PS) Յ 2; bidimensionally
measurable disease assessed by chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan; and satisfactory hematological, renal, and liver
functions. Patients who had received previous adjuvant chemotherapy and up to a maximum of three lines of palliative chemotherapy, as well as those with no measurable disease, were
permitted into the study.
The protocol was approved by the Scientiﬁc and Research
Ethics Committee of the participating institutions as well as the
London Multicenter Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient at registration.
Details of all eligible patients were forwarded to the trial ofﬁce
based at the Royal Marsden Hospital (Surrey, UK) to verify eligibility criteria and were prospectively registered for the trial. Patients who achieved a radiological objective response or disease
stabilization after 24 weeks of irinotecan were then randomly
assigned by an independent randomization ofﬁce to either stop
irinotecan or continue irinotecan in a 1:1 basis using random
permuted blocks. Patients were stratiﬁed according to number of
previous lines of treatment. Patients, who did not have measurable
disease on entry into the study, were eligible for random assignment if no objective disease progression was observed after 24
weeks of irinotecan.
Before treatment, the serum carcinoembryonic antigen level
was measured, in addition to laboratory testing for hematological
and biochemical proﬁle. Baseline QoL assessment was made using
the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
QoL Questionnaire core 30 (EORTC QLQc30).
Patients were treated with irinotecan 350 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for eight cycles. No reduced
starting dose was recommended in the protocol for patients aged
Ն 70 years, those with WHO PS 2, or patients receiving previous
pelvic radiotherapy. Before irinotecan, intravenous 5HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone were given. If patients developed acute
cholinergic syndrome, then atropine 0.25 mg subcutaneously was
given, and future courses would also be preceded by atropine,
although in the latter part of the study, all patients were given
prophylactic atropine before the ﬁrst course of treatment.
3024

Toxicity was measured using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.11 Delayed diarrhea was
managed with loperamide and prophylactic ciproﬂoxacin as per
unit guideline. A dose reduction of irinotecan to 300 mg/m2 in
subsequent courses was made if patients developed grade 3 or 4
diarrhea, grade 4 neutropenia, or grade 3 febrile neutropenia. A
second dose reduction to 250 mg/m2 was recommended with the
recurrence of these toxicities. Patients were withdrawn from the
study if signiﬁcant toxicity occurred at a dose level of 250 mg/m2.
Dose delay for up to 2 weeks was recommended in cases of absolute neutrophil count less than 1.5 ϫ 109/L, platelet less than
100 ϫ 109/L on the day of treatment, or grades 2 to 3 renal and liver
dysfunction during treatment.
Radiological assessments with CT scan were made after every
four cycles of irinotecan. Radiological tumor response was evaluated according to WHO criteria.12 Complete response (CR) was
deﬁned as the complete disappearance of all measurable lesions,
without the appearance of new lesion(s). Partial response was
deﬁned as a reduction of bidimensional lesions by Ն 50% of the
sum of the products of the largest perpendicular diameters of each
measurable lesion, and no progression in other lesions or appearance of any new lesions. Stable disease (SD) was deﬁned as a less
than 50% reduction of tumor volume or a less than 25% increase
in the volume of one or more measurable lesions, with no new
lesions. Progressive disease (PD) was deﬁned as an increase of
Ն 25% of the size of at least one bidimensionally measurable
lesion, the appearance of new lesion(s), and/or the onset of ascites
or pleural effusion with cytological conﬁrmation. Patients who
were randomly assigned to stop irinotecan would continue to have
clinical and biochemical reassessment every 3 months after the
completion of irinotecan, whereas those in the continueirinotecan arm would have repeated CT after every four cycles of
irinotecan. QoL assessment was repeated after completing eight
cycles of irinotecan and then every 6 weeks until PD. QoL questionnaires were mailed to patients if they were not due for clinic
visits. As the primary treatment period of interest in this trial was
after random assignment, no interval QoL assessment was made
during the ﬁrst eight cycles of chemotherapy, and more frequent
assessment was instituted after random assignment.
The primary end point was failure-free survival (FFS) from
time of random assignment (ie, after eight cycles of irinotecan).
One hundred twelve patients (56 in each arm) were required to
detect a 25% difference (from 25% to 50%) in 6-month FFS
following random assignment with 80% power and a 2-sided ␣ of
5%. It was anticipated that around 50% of prospectively registered
patients would have SD or responding disease after eight cycles of
treatment and were available for random assignment; therefore,
224 patients were required to be registered on the study.
Secondary end points included QoL, overall survival (OS),
and adverse events after random assignment. FFS was calculated
from the date of random assignment until PD, relapse, or death
from any cause. OS from registration or random assignment was
calculated from the date of registration or random assignment
until death from any cause or censored at last follow-up respectively. Both FFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method13 and were compared between the two arms using the
log-rank test.14 Hazard ratios for the stop-irinotecan arm were set
at 1. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.
Analyses were performed using SPSS package version 12 (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL).

RESULTS

Between November 1997 and September 2002, 333 patients
were prospectively registered into this study. Figure 1 shows
the trial proﬁle. Two patients were ineligible because of
previous carcinoma of the prostate (n ϭ 1) and elevated

bilirubin (n ϭ 1). Five patients were commenced with a
reduced dose of 300 mg/m2 and were considered to be
protocol violations, but they were included in the
intention-to-treat analysis. Two hundred thirty-six patients
(71%) developed PD, and 38 (11%) withdrew because of
intolerable toxicity. Of the remaining 57 patients (17.1%)

cycles of treatment, and in total, 236 patients (70.9%)
progressed after eight cycles. Twenty-nine patients withdrew from the study during the ﬁrst four cycles due to
intolerable toxicity, and another nine patients did so at
the end of eight cycles.
Table 3 presents the objective tumor response during
the ﬁrst eight cycles of irinotecan. The overall response rate
for the whole cohort was only 9% (95% CI, 6.2% to 12.6%).
Thirty patients, including eight patients who achieved an
objective response, were randomly assigned to stop irinotecan. One patient with lung metastases at registration had a
CR during the ﬁrst eight cycles of treatment and remains in
CR. Fifteen patients in the stop-irinotecan arm had further
chemotherapy on PD. Eight of these patients were rechallenged with irinotecan. The other seven patients received
oxaliplatin or mitomycin C– containing regimens, usually
due to short progression-free interval. It was not possible to
treat 14 of 29 patients in the stop-irinotecan arm with PD
due to deterioration of PS.
Twenty-ﬁve patients, including six objective responses,
were randomly assigned to continue irinotecan. Two patients developed PD following random assignment before
receiving any further irinotecan, and were included in analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. One hundred thirty-six
further cycles of irinotecan were given to this group of

patients. The median additional cycles delivered was four
(range, one to 12 cycles). The total irinotecan dosage per
cycle prescribed to patients after random assignment was
88% of the recommended total irinotecan dose (350 mg/
m2) per cycle. There were no further responses after random assignment.
Figure 2 shows the FFS for the randomly assigned
patients. There were no signiﬁcant differences in FFS between the two arms (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.78;
log-rank P ϭ .999). Six-month FFS rates were 25.3% (95%
CI, 11.2 to 42.2%) for stop irinotecan, and 36.4% (95% CI,
17.4 to 55.7%) for continue-irinotecan arm. At 6 months,
the point difference in FFS was not signiﬁcant (P ϭ .377).
Median FFS was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 3.8) and 4.9
months (95% CI: 3.9-5.9) for stop- and continueirinotecan arms, respectively.
Figure 3 shows the OS for the randomly assigned patients. Forty-three patients (78%) had died. There was no
signiﬁcant difference in OS between the two arms (hazard
ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.88 to 3.02; P ϭ .109). One-year
survival rates were 54.8% (95%CI, 34.2 to 71.4%) for the
stop-irinotecan arm and 46.3% (95%CI, 25.1 to 65.1%) for

the continue-irinotecan arm. The median survival from
random assignment was 13.4 months for the stopirinotecan arm and 12.1 months for the continueirinotecan arm. From the time of registration, the median
survival was 19 months for the stop-irinotecan arm and
17.7 months for the continue-irinotecan arm. Figure 4
shows the FFS and OS for the whole cohort of 333 patients.
The median and 1-year FFS was 3.6 months and 7.7% (95%
CI, 5.1% to 11.1%), respectively. The median and 1-year OS
was 9.3 months and 35.6% (95% CI, 30.1 to 42.2%).
Table 4 presents the mean scores and standard deviations of QoL scores assessed at random assignment and 12
weeks after random assignment. The number of questionnaires returned was small, but there were no differences in
QoL between the two arms. Table 5 shows the incidences of
grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurring after random assignment.
Serious adverse events were infrequent in both arms. In the
continue-irinotecan arm, no patients developed grade 3
diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, or infection after random
assignment. Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in two patients
only. All the grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities seen in the

In this article, we report that administering irinotecan
for a deﬁned duration of 24 weeks did not inﬂuence
outcome compared with continuous therapy in patients
with ﬂuoropyrimidine-refractory advanced CRC. However, continuing irinotecan beyond 24 weeks did not lead
to any clinically important incidences of serious adverse
events, and QoL was not compromised by continuing
on treatment.
Only 17% of our patients still had responding or SD
after eight cycles of irinotecan—much lower than our original anticipation of 50%. This study was designed in 1997
before the results of the two pivotal studies of irinotecan in
second-line treatment were known.3,4 Indeed, in these two
studies, irinotecan was given for a median of 4.1 and 4.2
months.3,4 Fifty-ﬁve percent of our patients already stopped
treatment after four cycles (3 months), predominantly due
to disease progression. Thus our question of whether continuous treatment would lead to prolonged disease control
compared with a deﬁned duration of eight cycles was only
relevant to a small proportion of patients. Our study was
therefore closed early and was underpowered to show a
clinically relevant survival difference between the two treatment arms. In fact, based on the actual proportion of patients who were eligible to be randomly assigned, close to
660 patients would be required to register on the study for
our original sample size of 112 randomly assigned patients.
Due to the prolonged period of recruitment and the inability to randomly assign 112 patients in a reasonable timeframe, the principal investigator, in conjunction with other
participating centers, decided to close the study in May
2003, after 348 patients were registered. No further patients
underwent random assignment. Based on 55 patients randomly assigned, a 40% difference in 6-month FFS (from 25%
to 65%) could be detected with 81% power (2-sided ␣ ϭ 5%)
compared with 25% difference as originally hypothesized.
Although the optimal duration of adjuvant chemotherapy has been addressed in colon cancer,7-9 randomized
data are lacking in advanced CRC comparing the two strategies of continuous treatment until disease progression or
deﬁned treatment duration. Whereas an early study in
breast cancer suggested that continuous chemotherapy resulted in longer time to disease progression, longer survival,
and better QoL compared with intermittent therapy,15
more recent data in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer and breast cancer suggested no additional clinical beneﬁt in terms of survival, QoL, and symptomatic response
with prolonged treatment.16-21 The United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) published a randomized

study comparing intermittent and continuous palliative
ﬁrst-line chemotherapy for 354 patients with advanced
CRC.10 In this study, patients received either infused FU/LV
(LVFU2) as described by de Gramont et al,22 or protracted
venous infusion FU or raltitrexed for 3 months only. Those
who achieved tumor response or disease stabilization were
then randomly assigned between the two treatment strategies (intermittent v continuous). No survival difference was
found between the two treatment strategies, though intermittent therapy was associated with reduced toxicity. The
median time to rechallenge was 4.3 months after stopping
ﬁrst-line chemotherapy. During rechallenge, an objective
response rate of 21% was obtained, with a median survival

of 10.8 months and 1-year survival of 46%. Notably, despite
being a principal intention of the trial, only 66 patients
(37%) randomly assigned to the intermittent group were
rechallenged with the same ﬁrst-line chemotherapy.
To our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst evaluating the
duration of second-line treatment in advanced CRC. Patients recruited into our study were representative of patients with CRC who received second-line treatment,4,23
though patients with PS 0 or 1 and solitary site of metastases
in our study seemed to be fewer than in other published
studies.3 The whole group’s median survival of 9 months
seemed to be similar to other published studies.3,4,23,24
However, the survival of randomized patients was exceptionally good (median survival of 17 to 19 months from
registration). This reﬂects that this group of patients, who
had responding or SD after 24 weeks of second-line irinotecan, was prognostically much more favorable than the
average patient receiving second-line treatment. Notably,
this group of patients only comprised 17% of the whole
group. Despite that, the median FFS was only 3 to 4 months
after random assignment, suggesting that chemoresistance
was probably already emerging at the time of random assignment. Indeed no objective responses were observed
with continuing irinotecan after random assignment.
Only eight patients (27%) in the stop irinotecan group
could be rechallenged with irinotecan on disease progression, and nearly half of the patients could not receive further
treatment due to rapid deterioration of their PS. Our protocol required patients in the stop-irinotecan arm to be

reviewed in clinic 3 months after random assignment without any speciﬁc repeat imaging assessment, and this period
might be too long. An earlier clinic visit with imaging assessment may allow disease progression to be detected in a
more timely fashion, thus allowing more patients to receive
further anticancer treatment.
Aside from the previously mentioned MRC study,
three other studies have evaluated the value of rechallenge
in the ﬁrst-line setting. One study reported on 49 patients
who were reinduced with same dose and schedule of FU and
LV on disease progression after completing a 6-month
course of ﬁrst-line FU and LV in a randomized trial of 248
patients comparing two isomers of LV.25 The median time
to rechallenge was 5.4 months after stopping ﬁrst-line chemotherapy. During rechallenge, an objective response rate
of 18% was obtained with a median OS of 8.9 months.
Another study assessed FU rechallenge in 613 patients recruited within three consecutive randomized studies.
Ninety-three patients were rechallenged, with a response
rate of 17% and a median survival of 14.8 months.26 More
recently, the OPTIMOX study reported on 623 patients
randomly assigned to FOLFOX4 given till disease progression or FOLFOX7 given for 12 weeks followed by LVFU2
for 24 weeks, and then reintroduced FOLFOX7 for 12 weeks
or earlier in case of progression on LVFU2 in patients
having responsive or SD at the ﬁrst FOLFOX7 administration. This study aimed to decrease the neurotoxicity associated with FOLFOX and to allow FOLFOX rechallenge. The
response rates and time to disease control was similar in
both arms, but less neurotoxicity was seen in the intermittent FOLFOX7 arm.27
However, the role of irinotecan rechallenge has been
highlighted by the recent introduction of cetuximab, a
monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor. In a randomized study, patients with epidermal
growth factor receptor– expressing metastatic CRC who
progressed on or within 3 months of irinotecan were randomly allocated to either combination of cetuximab and
irinotecan at the same dose and schedule or cetuximab
monotherapy.28 The combination produced an overall response rate of 22.9% and median time to progression of 4.1
months, which were both statistically signiﬁcantly better
than cetuximab monotherapy. This study demonstrated
that cetuximab could circumvent chemotherapy resistance
allowing irinotecan rechallenge.
After four cycles of irinotecan, only nine patients withdrew from our study due to intolerable toxicity, and for

those randomly assigned to continuous treatment, serious
adverse events were infrequent after eight cycles. No patients developed grades 3/4 diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, or
infection in the continue-irinotecan arm. Indeed two patients in the continue-irinotecan arm proceeded to receive
an additional 12 cycles of treatment. Our data suggest that
patients who tolerate irinotecan with appropriate dose
modiﬁcation beyond the ﬁrst four cycles are unlikely to
experience further dose-limiting toxicity, and the incidence
of late intolerable adverse events is low.
There were no differences in QoL in all functional
domains and symptom scales between the two arms at 12
weeks after random assignment. The small number of patients randomly assigned and the low number of questionnaires returned 12 weeks after random assignment
precluded smaller subtle differences in QoL to be detected
and ﬁrm conclusions to be made, though our data showed
that QoL was maintained with continuous treatment.
In conclusion, the decision to continue irinotecan beyond eight cycles in patients with ﬂuoropyrimidineresistant metastatic CRC is relevant in only a small
proportion (17%) of patients. There were no improvements in FFS from continuing irinotecan beyond eight
cycles. However, for patients randomly assigned to continue irinotecan, there was no deterioration in QoL, and
treatment was well tolerated. Although no OS beneﬁt was
demonstrated from continuing irinotecan, small but clinically important differences may exist.
