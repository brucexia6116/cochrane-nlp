Purpose: To compare two different timings of radiation treatment in patients with breast cancer who underwent
conservative surgery and were candidates to receive adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and ﬂuorouracil
(CMF) chemotherapy.
Methods and Materials: A total of <n>206</n> patients who had quadrantectomy and axillary dissection for breast cancer
and were planned to receive adjuvant CMF chemotherapy were randomized to concurrent or sequential
radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was delivered only to the whole breast through tangential ﬁelds to a dose of 50 Gy
in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, followed by an electron boost of 10 –15 Gy in 4 – 6 fractions to the tumor bed.
Results: No differences in 5-year breast recurrence-free, metastasis-free, disease-free, and overall survival were
observed in the two treatment groups. All patients completed the planned radiotherapy. No evidence of an
increased risk of toxicity was observed between the two arms. No difference in radiotherapy and in the
chemotherapy dose intensity was observed in the two groups.
Conclusions: In patients with negative surgical margins receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be
delayed to up to 7 months. Concurrent administration of CMF chemotherapy and radiotherapy is safe and might
be reserved for patients at high risk of local recurrence, such as those with positive surgical margins or larger
tumor diameters. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

INTRODUCTION

Only one published prospective randomized trial has
been designed to investigate the sequencing of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The ﬁrst report from this trial (9)
showed more breast recurrences in the arm receiving chemotherapy ﬁrst and more distant metastases in the arm receiving radiotherapy ﬁrst. A recent update of this trial at 10
years showed no statistically signiﬁcant differences between
the two arms in both ﬁrst failure patterns and event-free
survival (10).
No prospective randomized trial has been designed to test
a third option for sequencing, that is, concurrent treatment.
The concurrent administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy would eliminate the need of delaying the initiation
of one modality until after the end of the other and could
provide an additive or superadditive interaction to tumor
response. Naturally, this concurrent treatment could cause
an increase in toxicity, a reduction in patient compliance,
and a worsening in cosmetic results.
All information available from the literature regarding

There is a wide consensus that patients with early-stage
breast cancer should be treated with breast-conserving surgery followed by whole-breast irradiation and boost to the
tumor bed. Chemotherapy is recommended for patients at
risk for distant metastases. However, the integration of
systemic and local therapy is controversial. In patients who
receive conservative surgery alone, breast recurrences occur
in 23.5–39.2% (1, 2). The addition of postoperative radiation
therapy can lower the recurrence rates to 5.8 –14.3% (1, 2).
Hence, there is concern that more recurrences might
occur if radiotherapy is started after the end of chemotherapy. Several retrospective studies have found higher breast
recurrence rates in patients in whom breast irradiation was
started after the end of chemotherapy (3–5). This ﬁnding,
however, has been disproved by other retrospective studies
(6 – 8). Such conﬂicting data point out the lack of reliability
of these studies in the correct interpretation of the results,
probably because of selection biases.

concurrent treatment is based on retrospective analyses of
data produced by different chemotherapy regimens and radiotherapy doses and fractionation schedules, some showing a higher incidence of cutaneous toxicity (11–13) and
others no increase in toxicity and very satisfactory compliance (14 –18), clearly demonstrating that biases in treatment
selection confound the interpretation of these retrospective
reports.
Because no increase in acute and late toxicity with concurrent radiotherapy and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
and ﬂuorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy was observed in our
experience (18), we designed a prospective, Phase III, randomized trial to compare the effect on local control of
concurrent vs. sequential CMF chemotherapy and radiotherapy in conservatively managed breast cancer patients who
were planned to receive adjuvant CMF chemotherapy.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
From January 1997 to November 2002, 206 women aged 18 –75
years who had breast-conserving surgery and axillary dissection
and in whom CMF chemotherapy was planned were candidates for
inclusion in this study. Inclusion criteria were: (1) histologically
proven inﬁltrating breast cancer, conservative breast surgery and
axillary dissection, and recommendation for adjuvant CMF; (2)
pathologic tumor (pT) Stage Յ2; (3) surgical margins free of
inﬁltration; (4) no evidence of distant metastases; (5) no previous
radiotherapy or chemotherapy; (6) age 18 –76 years; (7) adequate
function of bone marrow, kidney, liver, lung, and heart; (8) no
previous tumors, with the exception of adequately treated cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinomas and in situ carcinomas of
uterine cervix; (9) no evidence of infectious or psychotic diseases;
(10) provision of written informed consent; and (11) declared
availability to comply with the planned follow-up examinations.
Patients were mostly recruited from our surgical department,
with the agreement of the medical oncology department. A minor
number of patients were recruited from other hospitals, where
radiotherapy was not available to the patients, with the agreement
of the responsible oncologists.
All patients for whom adjuvant CMF chemotherapy was
planned after breast-conserving surgery for invasive breast carcinoma were randomized to receive either concurrent (starting
within 2 months from the day of quadrantectomy) or sequential
(starting 7 months from the day of quadrantectomy, after the last
CMF course) radiotherapy. Before randomization, patients were
stratiﬁed according to the following parameters: (1) tumor diameter (Յ2 cm vs. Ͼ2 cm), (2) age (Յ45 years vs. Ͼ45 years), and
(3) lymph node status (pNϪ vs. pNϩ).

Adjuvant CMF chemotherapy and tamoxifen
The CMF chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600
mg/m2 i.v.), methotrexate (40 mg/m2 i.v.), and 5-ﬂuorouracil (600
mg/m2) on Days 1 and 8, repeated every 28 days for six courses.
There was no planned dose reduction in both arms. Doses were
reduced as per usual in the presence of toxicity. Any dose reduction and any delay in chemotherapy delivery were recorded. The
relative received dose intensity was calculated by dividing the total
received dose of each drug by the number of weeks of treatment
(dose intensity) and then dividing it by the planned dose intensity
of that drug. After the completion of both chemotherapy and

Volume 64, Number 1, 2006

radiotherapy, 20 mg of tamoxifen was given orally daily for 5
years in estrogen receptor–positive patients.

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy was delivered with 6-MV photons by linear accelerators. Two isocentric tangential, medial, and lateral ﬁelds
were shaped to deliver a total dose of 50 Gy in 20 fractions over
4 weeks to the whole breast, followed by an electron boost of 10
Gy in 4 fractions or 15 Gy in 6 fractions in pT1 or pT2 cases,
respectively. The electron energy was chosen on the basis of the
location of the tumor bed, deﬁned by metallic clips purposely
positioned during surgery or measured on preoperative mammographic ﬁlms or planning CT, so that the 85% isodoses encompassed its maximum depth.
The dose to the whole breast was calculated at the isocenter
(International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements
[ICRU] point) with a range of Ϯ7%. The clinical target volume for
the two-tangential-ﬁeld technique was the whole-breast tissue between the muscular layer of the thoracic wall and the subcutaneous
tissue at a depth of 0.5 cm from the skin in the anterior–posterior
direction and between the midline and the mid-axillary line in the
medial–lateral direction. The maximum accepted thickness of lung
included in the beams was Յ2.5 cm, measured on portal imaging
or simulator ﬁlm. No patient received radiation treatment to the
regional lymphatics.

Study endpoints
In the present study we tested the hypotheses that concurrent
treatment would (1) be more effective than sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy, (2) not decrease the tolerance to the treatment, and (3) not inﬂuence cosmesis and treatment compliance.
The breast recurrence-free interval has been used to evaluate the
efﬁcacy of the two treatment timings. Other measured outcomes
included overall survival, local regional recurrences, and distant
metastases.
Breast recurrence was deﬁned as biopsy-documented recurrence
of the disease in the treated, ipsilateral breast, whether it occurred
at the original site or elsewhere within the treated breast.
Breast cancer developing in the opposite, untreated breast was
scored as a contralateral event.
Regional recurrence was deﬁned as biopsy-proven recurrence in
the ipsilateral regional node area (axillary, supraclavicular, or
internal mammary nodes).
Disease that developed in the contralateral, untreated lymph
node areas was scored as distant metastases in the absence of
proven contralateral breast cancer.
Toxicity was evaluated with the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer/Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group scoring system (19).
It was not possible to compare the grade of systemic hematologic toxicity in the two groups during chemotherapy because the
blood cell count examinations were done once per week in the
concurrent treatment group and only on the day before CMF
administration in the sequential treatment group, when bone marrow should have recovered from the maximum toxicity. For this
reason, our analysis was directed to evaluate the compliance to the
two treatment sequences. In other words, we analyzed whether and
how CMF administration was inﬂuenced by concurrent radiation
treatment and, conversely, whether and how the radiation course
was altered by concurrent CMF chemotherapy.

Statistical methods
For all measured endpoints, patients were censored at the time
of the speciﬁc event. Therefore, patients with ipsilateral relapse
before distant metastasis were censored at the time of breast
relapse, with respect to the ipsilateral breast relapse-free rates.
We hypothesized that the 5-year freedom from breast recurrences would be 90% in the delayed radiotherapy group and 97%
in the concurrent treatment group. On the basis of an 80% power
to detect a signiﬁcant difference (p Ͻ 0.05, two-sided), 200 patients were required in each group (400 total).
The planned duration of the study was 5 years. After initial good
accrual, the use of CMF as adjuvant chemotherapy progressively
decreased in favor of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens. This in turn was the cause of progressively decreasing
patient accrual in this study. For this reason, it was decided to close
the study in November 2002 (median follow-up, 65 months; no
patients were lost to follow-up).
After stratiﬁcation, patients were assigned to the study group
with a balanced randomization method, to ensure closely balanced
patient numbers in each group according to the planned strata.
Overall outcomes and patterns of cancer recurrence were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle; all enrolled
patients were included, including patients who did not follow the
protocol. Actuarial curves of the length of time until the ﬁrst

RESULTS
Between January 1997 and November 2002, 206 patients
were accrued in this study. Figure 1 shows the ﬂow diagram
of participants through each stage of this trial. All patients
in the concurrent treatment group and all but 1 in the
sequential CMF and radiotherapy group (because of an
intercurrent surgical emergency) completed the planned radiation therapy.
There were two protocol violations: 1 patient who received tamoxifen without CMF in the concurrent treatment
group, and 1 patient in the sequential treatment group who
received adriamycin plus CMF.
The clinical and pathologic features of the two groups of
patients are outlined in Table 1. The baseline recorded
characteristics were age, menopausal status, pT stage, tumor
diameter, number of removed and positive lymph nodes,
histologic grading, and estrogen receptor status.
All the above characteristics seemed to be well balanced
in the two patient groups.
Survival
Figure 2 shows the actuarial curves for rates of breast
recurrence-free survival (Fig. 2a), metastasis-free survival
(Fig. 2b), disease-free survival (Fig. 2c), and overall survival (Fig. 2d), according to the assigned treatment group.
The corresponding 5-year actuarial rates for sequential and
concurrent treatment arms were 97.2% and 97.9% (p ϭ
0.97), 92.5% and 94.1% (p ϭ 0.44), 86.8% and 87.1% (p ϭ
0.99), and 93.9% and 94.7% (p ϭ 0.56). The hazard ratios
(and their 95% conﬁdence limits) for the same endpoints in
the sequential as compared with the concurrent treatment
group were 1.04 (0.1–7.38), 1.50 (0.53– 4.22), 0.99 (0.48 –
2.10), and 1.40 (0.44 – 4.41), respectively.
Recurrences
The ﬁrst sites of recurrence and numbers of events for all
patients evaluated after a median follow-up (25th, 75th
percentile) of 65 (53, 82) months are summarized in Table
2. There were two breast recurrences in each group; these
appeared at 30 and 59 months in the concurrent and at 16
and 36 months in the sequential treatment group. Lymph
node and distant metastases occurred in 1 and 8 patients,
respectively, in the concurrent and 2 and 4 patients, respectively, in the sequential group. A contralateral breast or

grading (p ϭ 0.13), age (p ϭ 0.13), and estrogen receptor

arms.
Toxicity compliance
The acute local toxicity was mild in both groups, with
infrequent moist desquamation in limited areas, such as the
submammary sulcus and low axillary region, that healed by
approximately 2 weeks after the end of the radiotherapy
course.
Late toxicity and cosmesis are presently being evaluated
and will be reported separately.
Delivery of radiation therapy
Patients in the concurrent treatment group generally received one cycle of chemotherapy before the initiation of
the radiation therapy course. Speciﬁcally, radiation therapy
was started within 2 months from the day of deﬁnitive

surgery (generally concomitantly with the second CMF
course) in the concurrent treatment group and 7 months
after surgery (at the conclusion of the last CMF course) in
the sequential treatment group. Sequencing had no inﬂuence
on the delivery of the planned radiation therapy.
All patients in the two groups received 100% of the
planned dose. No patient needed a break during the radiation course for skin or hematologic toxicity.

Delivery of CMF chemotherapy
As previously mentioned, there was no planned dose
reduction of CMF drugs. Sequencing of therapy had no
inﬂuence on the planned chemotherapy delivery or on the
delay in the delivery of chemotherapy owing to enhanced
toxicity. Table 3 outlines the number of CMF courses given
to each group and the relative dose intensity of each drug.
Ninety-three percent and 95% of patients in the concurrent
and sequential groups, respectively, received the six
planned chemotherapy courses. The mean relative dose
intensity of each drug component was not different in the
two arms.

DISCUSSION
Breast-conserving surgery followed by whole-breast irradiation has become the standard local treatment for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients at risk of distant
metastases.
The integration of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is still
controversial. Retrospective studies have suggested an increase in local recurrence rates when radiotherapy was
delayed to allow the delivery of full-dose chemotherapy
(3–5) and an increase in distant failure when radiation
therapy was given ﬁrst (6 – 8). Only one prospective randomized trial designed to study the sequencing of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been published, in 1996 (9).
The recent update of this study showed the loss, at 10 years,
of the signiﬁcant difference in local and distant recurrence
rates detected at 5 years between the two treatment arms
(10), though the trial was underpowered to detect small
differences. However, in a subset analysis according to
margin status, patients with close margins had lower local

recurrence rates in the radiotherapy-ﬁrst arm than in the
radiotherapy-delayed arm (4% vs. 32%). Patients with positive margins had a high rate of local recurrence, independently of the sequence (20% and 23% in the two arms,
respectively) (10, 22), indicating that a greater residual
tumor burden represents an important risk factor for local
recurrence.
Concurrent administration of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is an attractive option for patients because it shortens overall treatment time by up to 2 months and avoids
treatment delays. Furthermore, the concurrent delivery of
systemic chemotherapy might potentiate the biologic efﬁcacy of radiotherapy (23, 24) and overcome the higher risk
of local recurrence in patients with close or positive margins, though the toxicity of radiotherapy might also be
increased (11–13). Another concern is that the ability to

administer full-dose chemotherapy could be compromised
with concurrent treatment.
Some retrospective studies testing regimens of concurrent
chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast carcinoma have
shown high rates of acute toxicity (11–13). However, in
these studies electrons or bolus with X-irradiation were used
to increase the dose to the skin, after mastectomy, in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel, drugs known to potentiate the acute skin response to radiation. To minimize
the acute effects, some studies omitted radiotherapy on the
day of i.v. administration of chemotherapy (25), or omitted
methotrexate during the two cycles given concurrently with
radiotherapy (26 –28), or gave reduced drug doses (17) or
radiotherapy dose, or also minimized the overlapping of the
two modalities (22). No prospective randomized trials comparing concurrent vs. sequential radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been published as full-length articles.
Our ﬁndings show that there were no differences in local
and distant recurrence rates and in disease-free and overall
survival according to sequence. Although the study is underpowered for the anticipated differences, the 206 patients
accrued in this study would have allowed the detection of
signiﬁcant differences of 10% or more in recurrence rate,
based on 80% power (two-sided tests), between the two
sequence arms.
The chemoradiation regimens and sequences used in this
randomized study seemed to be both tolerable and effective.
An interesting ﬁnding emerging from our data was the lower
local recurrence rates in both sequence groups (2% and 2%),
compared with the radiation-ﬁrst and chemotherapy-ﬁrst arms
of the randomized trial (5–14%) (9) and the two large retrospective series of concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy
(5% and 6.3%) (25, 29). Whether these low local recurrence
rates are due to the negative surgical margins in our patients or
to the biologically more aggressive radiation schedule used in
our study (biological equivalent dose ϭ 75 Gy vs. 70 –72 Gy
in the conventional schedules) or to both, cannot be stated.

Volume 64, Number 1, 2006

Despite the concurrent full doses of radiation and drugs,
acute local toxicity was comparable in the two groups, with
occasional moist desquamation occurring in the submammary sulcus or low axillary area. No patients required
radiotherapy treatment breaks because of acute toxicity.
Radiation pneumonitis was not seen in either group of
patients. In our study, patients were treated by breast tangents without regional node irradiation and without skin
bolus, and much attention was paid to limit the volume of
irradiated lung to not more than 2.5 cm on the central slice.
Despite concurrent therapy and the use of standard irradiation and chemotherapy doses, there was no inﬂuence of
sequencing on the percentage of planned chemotherapy
actually delivered. Ninety-three percent and 95% of the
patients in the concurrent and sequential treatment group,
respectively, received all six planned CMF courses. The
relative dose intensity of the three CMF drugs was 93.8% or
greater in both groups.
Cosmetic results and late toxicity are being evaluated
separately and will be reported later.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings showed that CMF chemotherapy had an acceptable toxicity and was not inﬂuenced
by the treatment sequence, with nearly all patients receiving the full drug doses. The local failure rate was
very low and similar in the two groups of patients,
suggesting that, in patients without speciﬁc risk for local
recurrence, radiotherapy can be delayed up to 7 months.
Conversely, concurrent CMF chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment, although not showing a higher toxicity, by shortening the overall treatment time and potentially enhancing the radiation efﬁcacy, could be more
appropriate to patients with high risk of recurrence, for
example, in those with inﬁltration of surgical margins
and with large tumor size. However, additional studies
with the chemotherapy agents more commonly used today in adjuvant treatment are necessary to conﬁrm the
validity of such a strategy.
