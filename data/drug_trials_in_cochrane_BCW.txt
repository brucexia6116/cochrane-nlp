Abstract 1 of 500

Prothrombin fragments (F1+2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and D-dimers, markers of hemostatic system activation, were measured in <n>59</n> consecutive patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients were randomly treated either with <tx1>subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UH) administered in two to three subcutaneous doses adjusted to activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)</tx1> or with <tx2>low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (dalteparin) administered in a fixed dose of 200 IU/kg body weight in one subcutaneous injection daily</tx2>. Before treatment, F1+2, TAT and D-dimer were above the cut-off level in 27/59 (46%), 34/59 (58%) and all (100%) patients, respectively. Significant associations were observed between F1+2 and TAT (r=.66, P<.001), TAT and D-dimer (r=.36, P<.005) and F1+2 and D-dimer (r=.30, P<.050). On the third day of treatment, F1+2 and TAT significantly decreased to reference values in almost all patients (in 64/66 determinations of both F1+2 and TAT) and remained low on the seventh day of treatment. Compared to pretreatment values, a nonsignificant decrease of D-dimer was noted in both groups, but all values remained above the cut-off value. When markers of hemostatic system activation in the UH and LMWH groups were compared, no significant differences were observed. It was concluded that subcutaneous <tx1_a>UH in an APTT-adjusted dose</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>subcutaneous LMWH</tx2_a> in a once-daily weight-adjusted dose controlled these markers of hemostatic system activation in a similar manner.

Abstract 2 of 500

Among all the causes of chronic low back pain, myofascial pain syndrome of the spinal stabilizer muscles is one of the most frequent, yet underconsidered sources of pain. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of <tx1>type-A botulinum toxin (BTX-A)</tx1> in relieving myofascial pain in patients experiencing mechanical low back pain due to bilateral myofascial pain syndrome involving the iliopsoas and/or the quadratus lumborum muscles. Each of the <n><n1><n2>27</n2></n1></n> enrolled patients received <tx1_a>a bilateral, fluoroscopically guided injection in the affected muscle(s) to randomly deliver BTX-A</tx1_a> in one side of the low back and <tx2>a control drug (randomly constituted by NaCl 0.9% or bupivacaine 0.25%)</tx2> in the opposite side. To evaluate the effects of treatment on daily life activities and psychologic status, 5 different questionnaires were administered (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale [HAD-A and HAD-D], Lattinen, Oswestry, and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index). <tx1_a>BTX-A injection</tx1_a> did not significantly reduce visual analog scale scores more than treatment with <tx2_a>NaCl or bupivacaine</tx2_a> in the contralateral side; furthermore, the treatments administered did not result in a significant improvement of patients' daily life activities or psychologic status. Although a trend toward a decrease in postintervention visual analog scale scores could be recognized in all low back sides, this trend was significant only in the sides treated with <tx1_a>BTX-A</tx1_a>. <tx1_a>BTX-A</tx1_a> seems to provide significant postintervention pain relief. However, considering its high cost and the small differences compared with control treatments, its use should be reserved only for patients with pain refractory to other invasive treatments.

Notes: an interesting trial, because everyone got the BTX-A, but the side of the back to which the tx was administered was randomized.



Abstract 3 of 500

A once-daily regimen of cefazolin (2 g intravenously [iv]) plus probenecid (1 g by mouth) was compared with a once-daily regimen of ceftriaxone (1 g iv) plus oral placebo in a randomized, double-blind equivalence trial of home-based therapy for moderate-to-severe cellulitis in adults. For the assessable recipients of cefazolin-probenecid (n=59) and ceftriaxone-placebo (n=57), clinical cure occurred at the end of treatment in 86% and 96% (P=.11), respectively, and was maintained at 1 month of follow-up in 96% and 91% (P=.55), respectively. The mean number of treatment doses (+/-standard deviation) given was similar in the 2 treatment arms (6.97+/-2.6 for cefazolin-probenecid and 6.12+/-2.1 for ceftriaxone-placebo; P=.06). The median antibiotic trough concentrations were 2.35 microgram/mL for cefazolin and 15.45 microgram/mL for ceftriaxone. Patients in the 2 treatment arms were similar with regard to overall rates of adverse reaction (P=.15), but nausea was more common among those in the cefazolin-probenecid arm (P=.048). The once-daily regimen of cefazolin-probenecid is a cheap, practical, and effective treatment option for moderate-to-severe cellulitis, and it avoids the need to use third-generation cephalosporins in most patients.

Abstract 4 of 500

We evaluated the efficacy of <tx1>pramipexole</tx1> versus <tx2>placebo</tx2> in restless legs syndrome (RLS) for 6 weeks. Overall, <n>345</n> patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive either <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> (n = <n2>115</n2>) or <tx1_a>pramipexole</tx1_a> (n = <n1>230</n1>) with a starting dose of 0.125 mg/day. The dose was individually optimized according to the Patient Global Impression (PGI) assessment, up to a maximum of 0.75 mg/day. The primary endpoint consisted of two assessments: the change from baseline in the International RLS Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) and the proportion of patients with Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) assessments of "much/very much improved" (CGI-I responders) at week 6. Secondary endpoints included PGI and IRLS responder rates. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. At baseline, mean IRLS scores were 24.9 (<tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>) and 24.7 (<tx1_a>pramipexole</tx1_a>), representing severely affected patients. After 6 weeks, adjusted mean reductions (+/-SE) in IRLS score were 5.7 (+/-0.9) for <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> (median dose 0.47 mg/day) and 12.3 (+/-0.6) for <tx1_a>pramipexole</tx1_a> (median dose 0.35 mg/day; P < 0.0001). CGI-I responder rates were 32.5% (<tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>) and 62.9% (<tx1_a>pramipexole</tx1_a>) (P < 0.0001). For all secondary endpoints, <tx1_a>pramipexole</tx1_a> showed superior results. <tx1_a>Pramipexole</tx1_a> was well tolerated throughout the study. (c) 2006 Movement Disorder Society.

Abstract 5 of 500

To evaluate whether <tx1>isopropyl alcohol vapor</tx1> is an effective treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting. Double-blind, randomized, controlled study. Pediatric surgery center. <n>91</n> ASA physical status I and II children age 6-16 years, scheduled to undergo general anesthesia and elective outpatient surgery. Subjects were randomized to <tx1_a>inhale isopropyl alcohol</tx1_a> or <tx2>saline</tx2>. The intervention was repeated up to three times. If postoperative nausea or vomiting persisted after three sequences, intravenous ondansetron was administered as rescue therapy. Improvement in nausea was assessed using a visual analog scale, and improvement in vomiting was assessed using categorical analysis. After three treatment sequences, 65% of the children in the treatment group and 26% of the children in the control group had a significant reduction in the severity of either nausea or vomiting (p = 0.03). However, 54% of subjects in the treatment group and 80% of subjects in the control group had recurrent nausea or vomiting within 20 to 60 minutes. Under the conditions of this study, repetitive <tx1_a>inhaled isopropyl alcohol</tx1_a> only achieved a transient antiemetic effect in children with established postoperative nausea or vomiting following general anesthesia and surgery.

Abstract 6 of 500

To compare the efficacy and safety of the low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the acute treatment of DVT patients who had not previously received UFH. An open randomized multicentre trial with blinded analysis of venograms. Seven hospitals in Sweden, Finland and the USA. A total of 330 patients, of 20 years or older, with suspected DVT, verified using venography. Fixed-dose dalteparin (200 IU kg-1) given as a once-daily subcutaneous injection, or aPTT adjusted i.v. UFH infusion for 6 to 10 days. Change in Marder score in patients with confirmed DVT and two evaluable venograms; PE, bleeding events and follow-up. Marder scores improved in 51% (95% CI 42-60%) of 92 patients treated with dalteparin and in 62% (95% CI 53-70%) of 98 patients treated with UFH (P = 0.152). One dalteparin-treated patient had a PE confirmed by V/Q scan; another had progressive thrombosis with swelling in the affected limb. Bleeding complications occurred in six patients in each group. One patient treated with dalteparin and five treated with UFH died during the 6-month follow-up period as a result of underlying malignancy or heart disease. The 6-month recurrence rate was low with both treatments (dalteparin, 3/97; UFH, 2/103). Fixed-dose subcutaneous dalteparin given once daily from the start of treatment is of equivalent efficacy and safety to conventional UFH therapy in the routine management of DVT.

Abstract 7 of 500

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> with that of <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> in patients with an overactive bladder. A randomized, double-blind, <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>-controlled, parallel group, multinational phase-III study was conducted in urology and gynaecology clinics in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Sweden. The study enrolled <n>293</n> patients with urodynamically confirmed bladder overactivity, increased frequency of micturition (> or = micturitions/24 h) and symptoms of urgency and/or urge incontinence (> or = 1 episode/24 h). Patients received either <tx1>tolterodine (2 mg twice daily)</tx1> or <tx2>oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily)</tx2> or <tx3>placebo</tx3>. Doses could be reduced, to prevent withdrawal, to 1 mg or 2.5 mg, respectively. The main outcome measures were the mean change from baseline in frequency of micturition/24 h, the number of incontinent episodes/24 h and volume voided per micturition. After 12 weeks' treatment, the mean frequency of micturition decreased by 21% and 19.5% in those receiving <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> (n = <n1>118</n1>) and <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> (n = <n2>118</n2>), respectively, and by 10.5% in those on <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a> (n = <n3>57</n3>). Among those with urge incontinence at baseline (75% of patients), the mean number of incontinent episodes decreased by 47%, 71% and 19%, respectively, in those receiving <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a>, <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> and <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>. The effect of <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> on these two micturition variables was statistically equivalent. There was also a comparable increase in mean volume voided per micturition in the <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> (27%) and <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> groups (31%), compared with 7% in the <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a> group. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event and was reported with greater frequency and intensity among patients receiving <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> than among those receiving either <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> or <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>. In the <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> group, more patients also withdrew because of adverse events and a greater proportion required dose reduction as a result of adverse events. Despite dose reduction, the frequency of adverse events and the intensity of dry mouth remained higher among those receiving <tx2_a>oxybutynin (2.5 mg three times daily)</tx2_a> than in patients who remained on <tx1_a>tolterodine 2 mg twice daily</tx1_a>. <tx1_a>Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily</tx1_a> is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of bladder overactivity. <tx1_a>Tolterodine</tx1_a> was better tolerated than <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a>, particularly with respect to the frequency and intensity of dry mouth, but had comparable clinical efficacy. The superior tolerability of <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> therefore allows more patients to remain on effective therapy than the current most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of the overactive bladder.

Notes: curiously, the dosage for tx2 seems to change: from 5 mg 3x daily to 2.5 mg 3x daily...



Abstract 8 of 500

Whilst elevated urinary transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta) is associated with chronic renal dysfunction its role in acute peri-operative renal dysfunction is unknown. In contrast, peri-operative increases in urinary IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and TNF soluble receptor-2 (TNFsr-2) mirror pro-inflammatory activity in the nephron and correlate with renal complications. Steroids modulate some plasma cytokines (decreasing TNFalpha, IL-8, IL-6 and increasing IL-10), whereas ability to reduce plasma and urinary TNFsr-2 and IL-1ra and peri-operative renal injury is unknown. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were randomised to receive <tx1>methylprednisolone</tx1> (n = <n1>18</n1>) or <tx2>placebo</tx2> (n = <n2>17</n2>) before induction of anaesthesia. Plasma and urinary pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine balance was determined along with subclinical proximal tubular injury and dysfunction, measured by urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG)/creatinine and alpha-1-microglobulin/creatinine ratios, respectively. In the control group compared with baseline, plasma IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-10, IL-1ra and TNFsr-2 were significantly elevated along with urinary IL-1ra, TNFsr-2 and TGFbeta1. Urinary NAG/creatinine and alpha-1-microglobulin/creatinine ratios rose from completion of revascularisation until 6 h with recovery at 24 h with a further rise in NAG/creatinine ratio at 48 h. Compared to <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>, the <tx1_a>methylprednisolone</tx1_a> group showed significantly reduced plasma IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-1ra and TNFsr-2 whereas plasma IL-10 increased. Compared to <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>, the <tx1_a>methylprednisolone</tx1_a> group demonstrated significantly reduced urinary NAG/creatinine ratio, TNFsr-2 and TGFbeta1 at 24 h whereas urinary alpha-1-microglobulin/creatinine ratios increased. <tx1_a>Methylprednisolone</tx1_a> administration during cardiac surgery significantly reduces plasma and urinary TNFsr-2 and IL-1ra, urinary TGFbeta1 and subclinical renal injury but not dysfunction.

Abstract 9 of 500

(1) To test whether early prophylactic antidepressive treatment by mianserin is able to prevent poststroke depression, and (2) to discover whether mianserin as an antidepressant has any beneficial influence on the outcome of ischaemic stroke. A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study involved 100 consecutive patients under 71 years old admitted to hospital for an acute ischaemic stroke; they were enrolled to receive 60 mg/day mianserin or placebo for 1 year. They were examined on admission, and at 2, 6, 12, and 18 months with depression, stroke, and functional outcome scales. According to DSM-III-R, the prevalence of major depression was 6% at the initial stage, 11% at 1 year, and 16% at 18 months. At no time point did prevalences differ between the treatment groups, nor were differences found in depression scales, although at 2 months a greater improvement from initial assessment on the Hamilton depression scale was evident in patients on mianserin (p=0.05). Some beneficial changes on the Hamilton depression scale and Beck depression inventory were found in patients older than 56 (median age) and in men treated with mianserin, but not in other subgroups. Mianserin treatment did not affect stroke outcome as measured by neurological status, nor did it have any influence on functional outcome as measured by Rankin scale or Barthel index. It was not possible to show that early initiation of antidepressant therapy can prevent poststroke depression, because the prevalence of poststroke depression remained low even in patients on placebo. In this stroke population with a low rate of depressive patients, antidepressive medical treatment failed to affect stroke outcome.

Abstract 10 of 500

The clinical features of <n>49</n> patients who had sustained small strokes in the internal carotid artery territory, who were normotensive, free from cardiac or other relevant disease, and who each had a normal appropriate single vessel angiogram are presented. These were randomized into two groups: group A, <n1>25</n1> patients, who received only <tx1>supportive treatment</tx1>; group B, <n2>24</n2> patients who were treated with <tx2>anticoagulants for an average period of 18 months</tx2>. There was a reduced incidence of neurological episodes during the administration of <tx2_a>anticoagulant therapy</tx2_a> but, after treatment was discontinued, there was no significant difference between the two groups. In view of the relatively benign prognosis for this syndrome, unless special facilities exist for the personal control of <tx2_a>anticoagulant treatment</tx2_a>, the dangers may outweigh the benefits.

Abstract 11 of 500

To assess the effect of a short course of <tx1_a>low-dose oral corticosteroid used as an adjunct to antimicrobials</tx1_a> in patients with acute infective sinusitis. Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study including <n>42</n> patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute infective sinusitis. The study was performed at three primary healthcare sites in South Africa during the period January-November 2003. Two equal groups received either <tx1>betamethasone 1mg orally</tx1> (n = <n1>21</n1>; the treatment group) or <tx2>placebo tablets</tx2> (n = <n2>21</n2>; the placebo group) once a day in the morning for five consecutive days. All patients received <tx>amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 625mg orally, three times daily for 5 days</tx>. Patients rated symptoms on a daily symptom score card for 5 days and were examined by the investigator at diagnosis (day 0) and on the second visit (day 6). Headache, facial pain, nasal congestion and dizziness improved significantly from baseline in the treatment group compared with the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group over 5 days of treatment (p = 0.028, p </= 0.047, p </= 0.04 and p </= 0.051, respectively). Percussion tenderness improved significantly (p = 0.049) and clearance of purulent secretions almost reached significance (p = 0.058) in the treatment group compared with the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group. This study suggests a benefit of <tx1_a>oral corticosteroid added to antimicrobial treatment</tx1_a> of acute sinusitis and documents the first successful use of a short course of <tx1_a>low-dose oral corticosteroid</tx1_a> in patients with acute infective sinusitis.

Abstract 12 of 500

<tx1>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts</tx1> reduce portal pressure and can control ascites in patients with cirrhosis. We carried out a controlled study to evaluate this procedure for the management of refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis and to clarify its mechanism of action. <n>Twenty-five</n> patients with refractory ascites were included in the trial; <n1>13</n1> were randomly assigned to <tx1_a>shunts</tx1_a> and <n2>12</n2> to <tx2>paracentesis</tx2>. Four patients in each group were Child-Pugh class C and the others were class B. Follow-up ranged from 9 to 34 months. Hemodynamic values, liver and renal tests and neurohumoral factors were measured before and at 4 months after inclusion. <tx1_a>Shunts</tx1_a> were successfully placed in 10 out of <n1_a>13</n1_a> patients. At 4 months, ascites had improved in all class B patients in the <tx1_a>shunt</tx1_a> group and in none of the patients in the <tx2_a>paracentesis</tx2_a> group (p < 0.05); ascites did not improve in any of the class C patients in either of the groups. At 2 years, the overall survival rate was 29 +/- 13% (mean +/- SE) in the <tx1_a>shunt</tx1_a> group and 56 +/- 17% in the <tx2_a>paracentesis</tx2_a> group (p < 0.05). In class B patients, there was no significant difference in mortality. At 4 months, portal pressure was significantly lower than before the <tx1_a>shunt</tx1_a>, while plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were significantly higher and plasma levels of renin and norepinephrine significantly lower. In this trial, <tx1_a>intrahepatic shunts</tx1_a> were effective on refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis. However, the overall survival rate was lower in <tx1_a>shunted</tx1_a> patients than in those treated with <tx2_a>paracentesis</tx2_a>. The efficacy of <tx1_a>intrahepatic shunts</tx1_a> on ascites was only observed in class B patients. Survival did not improve in class B patients, and decreased in class C patients compared to <tx2_a>paracentesis</tx2_a>. The efficacy of <tx1_a>shunts</tx1_a> on ascites might be due to neurohumoral factors which control natriuresis and depend on hepatic sinusoidal pressure.

Abstract 13 of 500

Cough may be the consequence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and inflammation. This study was designed to investigate the short-term effects of <tx1_a>an inhaled steroid (fluticasone propionate (FP))</tx1_a> on cough, and to determine the effects of smoking, BHR, allergy and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on the efficacy of <tx1_a>FP</tx1_a>. In a community-based primary healthcare centre, <n>135</n> previously healthy adults suffering from cough for > or =2 weeks were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled trial of <tx1>inhaled FP 500 microg b.i.d. for 2 weeks</tx1>. Participants completed daily diary cards of lower respiratory tract symptoms. The primary outcome measure was the decrease in mean total daily cough score (0-6) during the second week of treatment. In the <tx1_a>FP</tx1_a> group, the cough score decreased from 3.8 at baseline to mean+/-SEM 1.4+/-0.2 during the second week. In the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group, this decrease was from 3.8 to 1.9+/-0.1 and was statistically significantly less. A favourable effect of <tx1_a>FP</tx1_a> was only detectable in nonsmokers, in whom the score was 0.9 points lower compared with <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>. The clinical relevance of this finding has to be established further. Allergy, FEV1 and BHR at baseline did not affect the efficacy of <tx1_a>FP</tx1_a>. In conclusion, anti-inflammatory treatment with the <tx1_a>inhaled steroid fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> reduces cough in otherwise healthy adults who do not smoke.

Abstract 14 of 500

To examine the effect of a reduced sodium and increased potassium and magnesium intake on blood pressure. Randomised double blind <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> controlled trial. General population of a suburb of Rotterdam. <n>100</n> men and women between 55 and 75 years of age with untreated mild to moderate hypertension. During 24 weeks the intervention group received a <tx1>mineral salt (sodium: potassium: magnesium 8:6:1) and foods prepared with the mineral salt</tx1>. Controls received <tx2>common salt and foods</tx2>. Change in blood pressure. Complete follow up was achieved for 97 of the <n_a>100</n_a> randomised subjects. Systolic blood pressure (mean of measurements at weeks 8, 16, and 24) fell by 7.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 4.0 to 11.2) and diastolic blood pressure by 3.3 mm Hg (0.8 to 5.8) in the <tx1_a>mineral salt</tx1_a> group compared with the controls, with a 28% decrease in urinary sodium excretion and a 22% increase in urinary potassium excretion. Twenty five weeks after the study the difference in blood pressure between the groups was no longer detectable. Replacing common sodium salt by a <tx1_a>low sodium, high potassium, high magnesium mineral salt</tx1_a> could offer a valuable non-pharmacological approach to lowering blood pressure in older people with mild to moderate hypertension.

Abstract 15 of 500

Combination bronchodilator therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is available widely throughout the world except in North America. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the advantages of combining anticholinergic therapy with sympathomimetic therapy in COPD. We report the results of a 12-week prospective, double-blind, parallel-group evaluation of the use of the following: albuterol, a beta-adrenergic agent; ipratropium, an anticholinergic agent; or a combination of the two, administered by metered-dose inhaler to patients with moderately severe stable COPD. Following baseline studies, 534 patients were given one of the three test bronchodilator preparations to be used at home four times daily in addition to oral theophylline and corticosteroids as required. The doses of the latter two drugs were kept stable. Subjects were tested on days 1, 29, 57, and 85. Analysis of 1-s forced expiratory volume (FEV1) curves on those test days indicated that the combination was superior to either single agent alone in peak effect, in the effect during the first 4 h after dosing, and in the total area under the curve of the FEV1 response. The mean peak percent increases in FEV1 over baseline on the four test days were 31 to 33 percent for the combination, 24 to 25 percent for ipratropium, and 24 to 27 percent for albuterol. The differences between the combination and its components were statistically significant on all test days. The AUC0-4 means for the combination were 21 to 44 percent greater than the ipratropium means and 30 to 46 percent greater than the albuterol means. Similar changes were noted in the forced vital capacity curves. Symptom scores did not change over time and did not differ among the treatment groups. We conclude that the combination of ipratropium and albuterol, when given by metered-dose inhaler to patients with COPD, is more effective than either of the two agents alone. The advantage of the combination is apparent primarily during the first 4 h after administration. The availability of combination therapy by metered-dose inhaler should help to improve patient compliance.

Abstract 16 of 500

A prospective controlled randomized trial testing <tx1>adjuvant postoperative combination chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, lomustine (CCNU) and vincristine)</tx1> versus <tx2>no adjuvant therapy</tx2> in patients operated on for Dukes' C colorectal cancer is reported. In total <n>334</n> patients aged less than 70 years were recruited: 205 patients with colonic and 99 with rectal cancer, but there were three protocol violations and these cases are excluded from further consideration. Twenty-seven patients had a limited resection of their cancer. After 5 years' follow-up there was no significant difference in the tumour-free survival rate or in the survival rate between the treated and control groups. Twenty-nine of the <n1>147</n1> patients who started chemotherapy discontinued this treatment because of side-effects, mainly from the gastrointestinal tract. In 30 patients treatment was discontinued because of recurrent disease. The conclusion is that systemic administration of <tx1_a>combination chemotherapy</tx1_a> for colorectal cancer after operation is not worthwhile in routine clinical practice.

Two intensive chemotherapy regimens <tx1>CFPMV (Cytoxan [cyclophosphamide], 5-fluorouracil, prednisone, methotrexate, vincristine)</tx1> and <tx2>CA (Cytoxan, Adriamycin [doxorubicin])</tx2> were tested against <tx3>a moderate regimen, CFP</tx3>, in a prospective three-arm, randomized study with crossover when relapse or failure occurred, in order to assess whether the response, duration of remission, and survival can be altered by using more intensive regimens as first-line or as rescue therapy. All three regimens were equally effective as initial chemotherapy: <tx3_a>CFP</tx3_a> 26/<n3>46</n3> (57%); <tx1_a>CFPMV</tx1_a> 31/<n1>48</n1> (65%) and <tx2_a>CA</tx2_a> 26/<n2>47</n2> (55%) (P = 0.61) with the least toxicity for the <tx3_a>CFP</tx3_a> regimen. Median duration of remission were 9.5, 11, and 9 months, respectively. Complete responses were almost identical in all three regimens: 4/<n3_a>46</n3_a> (9%); 6/<n1_a>48</n1_a> (12%) and 5/<n2_a>47</n2_a> (11%) (P = 0.94). <tx1_a>CFPMV</tx1_a> was an effective regimen as second-line therapy: 11/33 (33%) or third-line therapy: 7/21 (33%). The <tx2_a>CA</tx2_a> regimen was equally effective as second-line therapy: 8/25 (32%), suggesting that intensive regimens provide an effective rescue therapy, as well in previous responders as in nonresponders. Initial intensive regimens have not substantially altered long-term survival in the whole group of treated patients, Arm II (<tx1_a>CFPMV</tx1_a>----<tx2_a>CA</tx2_a>----<tx3_a>CFP</tx3_a>) 17.6 months; Arm III (<tx2_a>CA</tx2_a>----<tx3_a>CFP</tx3_a>----<tx1_a>CFPMV</tx1_a>) 12.3 months when compared with initial moderate regimens Arm I (<tx3_a>CFP</tx3_a>----<tx1_a>CFPMV</tx1_a>----<tx2_a>CA</tx2_a>) 16.6 months (P = 0.24). The same lack of difference in survival was noticed in responder patients in each arm: Arm II 19.0 months; Arm III 16.0 months versus Arm I 22.0 months (P = 0.13). Our data suggest that a moderate regimen is as effective as more intense regimens for induction therapy in metastatic breast cancer, with less toxicity, preserving the opportunity for an effective rescue therapy with intensive regimens in second or third-line chemotherapy.

Abstract 18 of 500

Although erythropoietin (EPO) is known to be useful in treating chemotherapy-induced anemia, few data are available on its potential preventive role. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of EPO in preventing the development of clinically significant anemia in patients treated with chemotherapy. Sixty-two early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing accelerated adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to receive EPO 150 U/kg three times a week or no additional treatment. Chemotherapy consisted of six cycles of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 (CEF) intravenously on day 1, every 2 weeks with the support of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), 5 microg/kg subcutaneously from day 4 to day 11. Throughout the six cycles of chemotherapy, EPO-treated patients maintained stable values of hemoglobin, whereas control patients developed a progressive anemia. At the end of chemotherapy, the mean (+/- SD) hemoglobin decrease in the control group was 3.05 g/dL (+/- 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6 to 3.5), whereas in the EPO group it was 0.8 (+/- 1.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.4). Clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin < or = 10 g/dL) occurred in 16 patients (52%; 95% CI, 33 to 69) in the control arm and in no patient (0%; 95% CI, 0 to 14) in the EPO arm (P = .00001). EPO prevents anemia in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Further trials are required to identify subsets of patients in which the preventive use of this drug could be cost-effective.

Abstract 19 of 500

Combined hyperlipidemia (CHL) is characterized by a concomitant elevation of plasma levels of triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and cholesterol-rich, low density lipoproteins (LDLs). The predominance of small, dense LDLs contributes significantly to the premature development of coronary artery disease in patients with this atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a>, a newly developed inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase, on the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated remodeling of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoprotein subspecies, and more specifically, the particle subpopulations of VLDL and LDL in CHL. In parallel, we evaluated the <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a>-induced modulation of the quantitative and qualitative features of atherogenic apo B-containing and cardioprotective apo AI-containing lipoprotein subspecies. <tx1>Atorvastatin therapy (10 mg/d for a 6-week period)</tx1> in patients with a lipid phenotype typical of CHL (n=<n>18</n>) induced reductions of 31% (P<0.0001) and 36% (P<0.0001) in plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, respectively. In addition, <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> significantly reduced VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apo B levels by 43% (P<0.0001), 27% (P=0.0006), and 31% (P<0.0001), respectively. The plasma concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL1, Sf 60 to 400; VLDL2, Sf 20 to 60; and intermediate density lipoproteins, Sf 12 to 20) and of LDL, as determined by chemical analysis, were markedly diminished after drug therapy (-30% and -28%, respectively; P<0.0007). <tx1_a>Atorvastatin</tx1_a> significantly reduced circulating levels of all major LDL subspecies, ie, light (-28%, P<0.0008), intermediate (-27%, P<0.0008), and dense (-32%, P<0.0008) LDL; moreover, in terms of absolute lipoprotein mass, the reduction in dense LDL levels (mean -62 mg/dL) was preponderant. In addition, the reduction in plasma dense LDL concentration after therapy was significantly correlated with a reduction in plasma VLDL1 levels (r=0.429, P=0.0218). <tx1_a>Atorvastatin</tx1_a> induced a significant reduction (-7%, P=0.0039) in total CETP-dependent CET activity, which accurately reflects a reduction in plasma CETP mass concentration. Total CETP-mediated CET from high density lipoproteins to apo B-containing lipoproteins was significantly reduced (-26%, P<0.0001) with drug therapy. Furthermore, CETP activity was significantly correlated with the <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a>-induced reduction in plasma VLDL1 levels (r=0.456, P=0. 0138). Indeed, <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> significantly and preferentially decreased CET from HDL to the VLDL1 subfraction (-37%, P=0.0064), thereby reducing both the levels (-37%, P=0.0001) and the CE content (-20%, P<0.005) of VLDL1. We interpret our data to indicate that 2 independent but complementary mechanisms may be operative in the <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a>-induced reduction of atherogenic LDL levels in CHL: first, a significant degree of normalization of both the circulating levels and the quality of their key precursors, ie, VLDL1, and second, enhanced catabolism of the major LDL particle subclasses (ie, light, intermediate, and dense LDL) due to upregulation of hepatic LDL receptors.

Abstract 20 of 500

To evaluate the efficacy of <tx1>continuous passive motion (CPM)</tx1> in the postoperative management of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. A randomized controlled single-blind trial of <tx1_a>CPM</tx1_a> plus <tx>standardized rehabilitation</tx> vs <tx2>standard rehabilitation alone</tx2>. A referral hospital for arthritis and musculoskeletal care. Consecutive patients with end-stage osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty who had at least 90 degrees of passive knee flexion. One hundred fifty-four patients were eligible and <n>102</n> patients agreed to participate and were randomized. Ninety-three patients completed the study protocol. <tx1_a>Continuous passive motion machines programmed for rate and specified arc of motion within 24 hours of surgery with range increased daily as tolerated with <tx_a>standardized rehabilitation</tx_a></tx1_a> program compared with <tx2_a><tx_a>standardized rehabilitation program</tx_a> alone</tx2_a>. Primary outcomes were pain, active and passive knee range of motion, swelling (or circumference), quadriceps strength at postoperative day 7, as well as complications, length of stay, and active and passive range of motion and function at 6 weeks. Use of <tx1_a>CPM</tx1_a> increased active flexion and decreased swelling and the need for manipulations but did not significantly affect pain, active and passive extension, quadriceps strength, or length of hospital stay. At 6 weeks there were no differences between the two groups in either range of motion or function. In this series, use of <tx1_a>CPM</tx1_a> resulted in a net savings of $6764 over conventional rehabilitation in achieving these results. For the average patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty, <tx1_a>CPM</tx1_a> is more effective in improving range of motion, decreasing swelling, and reducing the need for manipulation than is conventional therapy and lowers cost.

Abstract 21 of 500

A 4-week course of high-dose glucocorticoids may cause prolonged adrenal suppression even after a 9-day tapering phase. In this study, adrenal function and signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were prospectively assessed in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after induction treatment including high-dose prednisone (PDN) or dexamethasone (DXM). Sixty-four children with ALL, treated according to the AIEOP ALL 2000 Study protocol, underwent low dose ACTH (LD-ACTH) stimulation 24 hr after the last tapered steroid dose. In those with impaired cortisol response, additional LD ACTH tests were performed every 1-2 weeks until cortisol levels normalized. Signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were recorded during the observation period. All patients had normal basal cortisol values at diagnosis. Twenty-four hours after last glucocorticoid dose, morning cortisol was reduced in 40/64 (62.5%) patients. LD-ACTH testing showed adrenal suppression in 52/64 (81.5%) patients. At the following ACTH test 7-14 days later, morning cortisol values were reduced in 8/52 (15.4%) patients and response to the test was impaired in 12/52 (23%). Adrenal function completely recovered in all patients within 10 weeks. No difference was found between patients treated with PDN or DXM. Almost 35% of children with impaired cortisol values at the first test developed signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. One child developed a severe adrenal crisis during adrenal suppression. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy in ALL children may cause prolonged adrenal suppression and related clinical symptoms. Laboratory monitoring of cortisol levels and steroid coverage during stress episodes may be indicated. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Abstract 22 of 500

Staphylococcal infections are a major cause of catheter infections and peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Since catheter-related infections are associated with nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in this population, we studied the effect of <tx1_a>intermittent rifampin</tx1_a>, an antibiotic known to decrease S aureus nasal carriage, on catheter-related infections and peritonitis. We randomly assigned <n>64</n> patients to receive either <tx1>rifampin 300 mg twice daily for 5 days every 3 months</tx1> or <tx2>no treatment</tx2>. The <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a>-treated patients had a significant delay in time to first catheter-related infection (P less than 0.015) and significantly fewer catheter-related infections overall (P less than 0.001). The catheter-related infection rate in <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a>-treated patients was .26 per patient-year versus .93 per patient-year in untreated patients. Multivariate analysis defined baseline colonization of nares or catheter exit-site and prior renal transplant as risk factors for catheter-related infections. There was no significant difference in peritonitis rates between groups, although the trend was for a delayed time to first episodes and fewer episodes in <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a>-treated patients. Adverse effects necessitated withdrawal of <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a> in four patients. We conclude that <tx1_a>intermittent rifampin</tx1_a> administration is effective in decreasing catheter-related infections in a peritoneal dialysis population.

Abstract 23 of 500

Actinic keratosis (AK), the most common premalignant skin condition, can represent a management challenge. Treatment should not only be effective, but also well tolerated and allow for good cosmesis on typical sun-exposed highly visible body sites. The primary objective was to compare the lesion response and subject preference for <tx1>topical methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL)-photodynamic therapy (PDT)</tx1> vs. <tx2>cryotherapy for the treatment of AK</tx2>. In this 24-week, multicentre, randomized, intraindividual (right-left) study, subjects received both one treatment session of <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> and a <tx2_a>double freeze-thaw cryotherapy</tx2_a>; the treatments were randomly allocated to either side of the face/scalp. Lesions with a noncomplete response were retreated after 12 weeks. The primary assessments were the subject's overall preference and lesion response at week 24. Secondary assessments included lesion response at week 12, cosmetic outcome, subject and investigator cosmetic outcome preference at week 24, and investigator overall preference at week 24. Skin discomfort and adverse events were also evaluated. In total, <n><n1><n2>119</n2></n1></n> subjects with 1,501 lesions were included in the study. At week 12, treatment with <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> resulted in a significantly larger rate of cured lesions relative to <tx2_a>cryotherapy</tx2_a> (percentage lesion reduction from baseline: 86.9% vs. 76.2%; P < 0.001). At week 24, both treatment groups showed a high rate of cured lesions (89.1% for <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> vs. 86.1% for cryotherapy; P = 0.20; 95% confidence interval: -1.62 to 7.67). Results for subject and investigator preferences as well as cosmetic outcome favoured <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a>. Both treatment regimens were safe and well tolerated. The present study shows that, when treated with both MAL-PDT and cryotherapy, subjects significantly prefer <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> treatment for AK. <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> is an attractive treatment option for AK, with comparable efficacy and superior cosmetic outcomes compared with <tx2_a>double freeze-thaw cryotherapy</tx2_a>.

Notes: Another one of these weird 'intradindividual' trials where everyone is their own control… Technically this means n=n1=n2, I think. Of course, I'm not entirely sure if n should be the number of people or the number of lesions, but I went with the former.



Abstract 24 of 500

Acute mucositis is a dose-limiting toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Palifermin (a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor; DeltaN23-KGF) stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of mucosal epithelium to reduce mucositis in patients receiving intensive therapy for hematologic cancers. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of palifermin in patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In a phase II trial, standard radiotherapy was delivered in daily 2-Gy fractions to 70 Gy, or hyperfractionated radiotherapy was delivered in 1.25-Gy fractions twice daily to 72 Gy, over 7 weeks. Chemotherapy included cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) for 4 days and continuous-infusion fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m(2)/d for 4 days on weeks 1 and 5 of irradiation. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to palifermin 60 microg/kg or placebo once weekly for 10 doses. A follow-up trial evaluated long-term survival. Sixty-seven patients received palifermin and 32 received placebo. The median duration of grade >or= 2 mucositis was 6.5 and 8.1 weeks in the palifermin and placebo groups, respectively (P = .157). Palifermin appeared to reduce mucositis, dysphagia, and xerostomia during hyperfractionated radiotherapy (n = 40) but not standard radiation therapy (n = 59). Adverse events were similar between treatment groups. Palifermin did not alter tumor response or survival. Ten once-weekly doses of palifermin at 60 microg/kg were well tolerated. Most patients completed treatment, but palifermin did not reduce the morbidity of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Future studies should evaluate higher palifermin doses with longer and more standardized assessment of acute mucositis.

Abstract 25 of 500

<tx1_a>Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray</tx1_a>, a new topical corticosteroid, has been proved to be an effective treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis. We studied the effect of <tx1_a>fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> on nasal symptoms, circulating eosinophils, and nasal inflammation in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis after high-load pollen exposure. Moreover, we examined its efficacy in preventing the increase in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (PD20) during the pollen season. We conducted a double-blind, <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled, parallel-group study in patients who had a history of allergic rhinitis in response to pollens of grass and Parietaria species and were living in northern Italy. After a run-in period of 2 weeks, <n1>24</n1> patients were treated with <tx1>fluticasone propionate (200 micrograms, once daily)</tx1>, and <n2>26</n2> patients received matched <tx2>placebo for 6 weeks</tx2>, starting from the beginning of the pollen season. Assessment of efficacy was based on scores of daily nasal symptoms. Nasal lavage was performed at the end of the season, and differential cell count was expressed as percent of total cells. PD20 methacholine was measured at the beginning and end of the season and after the season had ended. <tx1_a>Fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> significantly reduced nasal obstruction, itching, and rhinorrhea. Eosinophils in blood (p < 0.01) and nasal lavage (p < 0.001) were also reduced. Moreover, <tx1_a>fluticasone</tx1_a> significantly attenuated the decrease in mean PD20 methacholine (from 1.95 to 0.89 mg) compared with <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> (from 1.38 to 0.37 mg: p < 0.01). After the season, no difference in PD20 methacholine was found between treatment groups. The results of this study indicate that fluticasone propionate is effective in decreasing nasal symptoms and eosinophil inflammation in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis after high-load pollen exposure. Our results also demonstrate that treatment with <tx1_a>fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> partially prevents the increase in bronchial responsiveness provoked by the inhalation of seasonal pollens in allergic rhinitis.

Abstract 26 of 500

A comparative, randomized, double-blind study of <tx1>diclofenac sodium 75 mg</tx1> im versus <tx2>Baralgin (a combination drug composed of dipyrone and two spasmolytics) 5 mL iv</tx2> was performed on <n>57</n> patients with renal colic. Both groups were comparable as to age, sex, pain evolution time before treatment, and no treatment for renal colic in the six hours preceding trial drug administration. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to the evolution of pain after the first dose or in the frequency of administration of a second dose. Tolerability was good in both groups, but sweating and pain throughout the vein were observed in one patient in the <tx2_a>Baralgin group</tx2_a>. We concluded that <tx1_a>diclofenac sodium</tx1_a> constitutes an excellent alternative to pyrazolone analgesics, with the advantages of being monotherapy and having good tolerability, when used as intramuscular injection in ambulatory patients.

Abstract 27 of 500

To assess, using a double-blind procedure, the pain-relieving effects of rTMS against placebo, and their predictive value regarding the efficacy of implanted motor cortex stimulation (MCS). Three randomised, double-blinded, 25 min sessions of focal rTMS (1 Hz, 20 Hz and sham) were performed in 12 patients, at 2 weeks intervals. Effects on pain were estimated from daily scores across 5 days before, and 6 days after each session. Analgesic effects were correlated with those of subsequent implanted motor cortex stimulation (MCS). Immediately after the stimulating session, pain scores were similarly decreased by all rTMS modalities. Conversely, during the following week, 1 Hz stimulation provided significantly less analgesia than 20 Hz and placebo, and was pro-algesic in some patients. Placebo and 20 Hz rTMS were effective on different patients, and only 20 Hz rTMS predicted the efficacy of subsequent MCS, with no false positives. While 1Hz rTMS should not be used with analgesic purposes, high-frequency rTMS may become useful to select candidates for MCS. Placebo effects are powerful and should be controlled for. Immediate results after a single rTMS session are misleading. Defining rTMS parameters is a crucial step before proposing rTMS as predictive test of SCM efficacy in clinical practice.

Abstract 28 of 500

In thrombotic microangiopathies hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombocytopenic purpura, <tx2>plasma exchange (PE) therapy using fresh frozen plasma</tx2> is standard. In almost 20% of the patients, however, this approach is ineffective. This prospective, randomized study for the treatment of patients with thrombotic microangiopathies (PRODROMI) compares <tx2_a>PE with fresh frozen plasma (A)</tx2_a> and <tx1>cryosupernatant (B)</tx1>. The participating centers were the University Clinics of Freiburg, Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Essen, Göttingen, Mannheim, Ulm, Jena, Tübingen, Würzburg, Kreiskrankenhaus Offenburg, Städt Klinikum Karlsruhe, and Horst-Schmidt Kliniken in Wiesbaden, Germany. Patients (18 to 80 years) were diagnosed by the individual centers based on clinical and laboratory findings (thrombocyte/fragmentocyte count, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, haptoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase levels; negative Coombs-test is obligatory). HIV infection, bone marrow, or solid organ transplantation were exclusion criteria. After written consent, patients were randomized in the A or B group. All patients received <tx>1.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone</tx> as a basic therapy. The first PE always was performed with fresh frozen plasma (50 ml/kg). A minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 PEs were required. Thrombocyte count above 150,000/microl was considered to be a successful therapy. Treatment failure was defined as not responding to 10 PE with a thrombocyte count above 150,000/microl or a fall below this value within 30 days after stopping PE. Patients with clinical and laboratory signs of thrombotic microangiopathy occurring later than 30 days after having stopped PE were considered to have a relapse. Primary endpoints were survival, intensity of required PE sessions (duration, volume, and number), and relapse rate. Follow-up of clinical outcome was 2 years; von Willebrand Factor (vWF), vWF-cleaving-protease activity, and Factor H were determined.

Notes: No conclusions??? Also note sure about this sentence: "The first PE always was performed with fresh frozen plasma (50 ml/kg)" -- what is this referring to? I fear I've missed something here, because as I've tagged it, cryosupernatant is mentioned only once...



Abstract 29 of 500

Early inflammatory lesions and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are characteristics of the respiratory distress in premature neonates and are susceptible to aggravation by assisted ventilation. We hypothesized that treatment with <tx4_a>inhaled salbutamol and <tx3_a>beclomethasone</tx3_a></tx4_a> might be of clinical value in the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in ventilator-dependent premature neonates. The study was double-blinded and <tx1_a><tx2_a>placebo</tx1_a></tx2_a> controlled. We studied <n>173</n> infants of less than 31 weeks of gestational age, who needed ventilatory support at the 10th postnatal day. They were randomised to four groups and received either <tx1>placebo + placebo</tx1>, <tx2>placebo + salbutamol</tx2>, <tx3>placebo + beclomethasone</tx3> or <tx4>beclomethasone + salbutomol</tx4>, respectively for 28 days. The major criteria for efficacy were: diagnosis of BPD (with score of severity), mortality, duration of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy. The trial groups were similar with respect to age at entry (9.8-10.1 days), gestational age (27.6-27.8 weeks), birth weight and oxygen dependence. We did not observe any significant effect of treatment on survival, diagnosis and severity of BPD, duration of ventilatory support or oxygen therapy. For instance, the odds-ratio (95% confidence interval) for severe or moderate BPD were 1.04 (0.52-2.06) for <tx3_a><tx4_a>inhaled beclomethasone</tx3_a></tx4_a> and 1.54 (0.78-3.05) for <tx4_a>inhaled salbutamol</tx4_a>. This randomised prospective trial does not support the use of treatment with inhaled <tx3_a><tx4_a>beclomethasone</tx3_a>, salbutamol</tx4_a> or their combination in the prevention of BPD in premature ventilated neonates.

Abstract 30 of 500

There are a lot of methods for smoking cessation but transdermal nicotine system (TNS) is one of the most popular. On a sample of more than 300 smokers we have formerly shown that TNS achieves higher abstinence rate than placebo (38%:21%). In the present study we have tested the optimal administration of TNS. 160 smokers were subdivided in 4 groups of 40, receiving either TNS or placebo, for 3 or 6 weeks. The abstinence rate was evaluated by appropriate questionnaires and measuring CO in the exhaled air. After 3 weeks of TNS 60% of the examinees were abstaining compared to 50% after 6 weeks; the abstinence rates in the placebo groups were 17.5% and 20%, respectively (p < 0.05). Short TNS treatment (3 weeks) is at least as effective as a longer one (6 weeks), which is relevant both medically and economically.

Abstract 31 of 500

<n>Fifty-two</n> healthy pregnant women were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. After the 26th week of gestation, the women were given either <tx1>1.5 g of elemental calcium per day</tx1> or a <tx2>placebo</tx2>. Subjects in the <tx1_a>calcium</tx1_a> group, after adjustment for race and initial blood pressure (BP), had a term mean systolic and diastolic BP value of 4-5 mmHg lower than those in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group (P less than .05). The incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was 11.1% in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group and 4.0% in the <tx1_a>calcium</tx1_a> group, a nonsignificant difference. Combining these values with previous data, we found a dose-effect relationship between <tx1_a>calcium</tx1_a> intake and BP reduction during the third trimester of pregnancy. Further research should be directed at understanding the mechanism of this effect and trying to demonstrate a reduction in pregnancy-induced hypertension with <tx1_a>calcium supplementation</tx1_a> in a larger population.

Abstract 32 of 500

Research suggests that fetal exposure to <tx1_a>magnesium sulfate</tx1_a> before preterm birth might reduce the risk of cerebral palsy. In this multicenter, <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned women at imminent risk for delivery between 24 and 31 weeks of gestation to receive <tx1>magnesium sulfate, administered intravenously as a 6-g bolus followed by a constant infusion of 2 g per hour</tx1>, or <tx2>matching placebo</tx2>. The primary outcome was the composite of stillbirth or infant death by 1 year of corrected age or moderate or severe cerebral palsy at or beyond 2 years of corrected age. A total of <n>2241</n> women underwent randomization. The baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Follow-up was achieved for 95.6% of the children. The rate of the primary outcome was not significantly different in the <tx1_a>magnesium sulfate group</tx1_a> and the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group (11.3% and 11.7%, respectively; relative risk, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.23). However, in a prespecified secondary analysis, moderate or severe cerebral palsy occurred significantly less frequently in the <tx1_a>magnesium sulfate group</tx1_a> (1.9% vs. 3.5%; relative risk, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.95). The risk of death did not differ significantly between the groups (9.5% vs. 8.5%; relative risk, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.47). No woman had a life-threatening event. Fetal exposure to <tx1_a>magnesium sulfate</tx1_a> before anticipated early preterm delivery did not reduce the combined risk of moderate or severe cerebral palsy or death, although the rate of cerebral palsy was reduced among survivors.

Abstract 33 of 500

Chronic pain in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is a difficult problem for which there is no simple method of treatment. Few randomized controlled trials of medications for pain in persons with SCI have been conducted. This study was designed to determine whether amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is efficacious in relieving chronic pain and improving pain-related physical and psychosocial dysfunction in persons with SCI. Eighty-four participants with SCI and chronic pain were randomized to a 6-week trial of amitriptyline or an active placebo, benztropine mesylate. All pre- and post-treatment assessments were conducted by evaluators blind to the allocation. Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether there was a medication group effect on the primary (average pain intensity) and secondary outcome measures. No significant differences were found between the groups in pain intensity or pain-related disability post-treatment, in either intent-to-treat analyses or analyses of study completers. These findings do not support the use of amitriptyline in the treatment of chronic pain in this population, but we cannot rule out the possibility that certain subgroups may benefit.

Abstract 34 of 500

The purpose of this study was to conduct pilot studies for large randomized controlled trials to compare <tx1_a>low-molecular-weight heparin</tx1_a> with <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> for antenatal thromboprophylaxis (trial 1), and for thromboprophylaxis after cesarean delivery (trial 2). Multicenter randomized controlled trials (trial 1, 23 units; trial 2, 8 units) were conducted. Pregnant women at increased risk for thromboembolic disease were eligible for trial 1; women who underwent cesarean delivery were eligible for trial 2. The interventions were <tx1>once daily injections of low-molecular-weight heparin</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2>. Primary outcomes were as follows: trial 1, confirmed symptomatic thromboembolic events and symptomatic osteoporotic fractures; trial 2, confirmed symptomatic thromboembolic events and wound complications. Sixteen women were recruited for trial 1; 1 woman in the placebo group had a symptomatic thromboembolic event. One hundred forty-one women were recruited for trial 2; 1 woman in the low molecular weight heparin group had a symptomatic thromboembolic event. Poor recruitment indicates that large-scale trials using these designs would be difficult. Collection of data on the number of women that are eligible and the reasons for nonrecruitment in future trials of these interventions would allow a better understanding of the reasons for poor recruitment.

Abstract 35 of 500

Therapeutic efficacy and safety of <tx1>loxapine succinate (LOX)</tx1> and <tx2>trifluoperazine hydrochloride</tx2> were compared by means of a controlled, double-blind study involving <n>49</n> chronic schizophrenic inpatients. The data indicated that <tx1_a>LOX in dosages ranging from 40 - 65 mg/day</tx1_a>, (usually administered on a b.i.d. schedule) had demonstrable anti-psychotic activity in 14 of <n1>25</n1> chronic schizophrenic patients (56%), while <tx2_a>TFP treatment in appropriate dosage</tx2_a> showed a similar activity in 9 of <n2>23</n2> patients (39%). Both <tx1_a>LOX</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>TFP</tx2_a> displayed essentially the same profile and incidence of side effects. Clinical laboratory abnormalities were minor. On the basis of this study, and in comparison with <tx2_a>trifluoperazine</tx2_a>, it appears that <tx1_a>loxapine</tx1_a> is an efficacious and essentially safe medication, suitable for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia.

Abstract 36 of 500

To compare the administration of bupivacaine hydrochloride, dexamethasone and lidocaine hydrochloride in decreasing post-tonsillectomy pain. Eighty patients were enrolled in the study in ENT Clinic, Firat University, and in ENT Clinic Elaziğ SSK Hospital, Elaziğ (Turkey). Children between 6 and 14 years of age referred to our department for bilateral tonsillectomy for either recurrent tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy. Data from 80 patients were analyzed. The first group had bupivacaine hydrochloride. The second group had dexamethasone infiltrated around each tonsil. The third group was given equal doses of 10% lidocain hydrochloride sprayed on the tonsillectomy fossa four times a day, and a placebo group received 9% NaCl applied to the tonsillar fossa four times a day. Pain scores, determined by visual analog scale, were obtained in the first, third and seventh postoperative days. Pain scores in the postoperative period were identical in the first, third and seventh postoperative days. According to VAS results the groups were compared on the basis of postoperative pain. In the first postoperative day, the difference between bupivacaine-placebo, dexamethasone-placebo and lidocaine-placebo groups was found to be statistically significant (P<0.05). Nevertheless the difference between bupivacaine-dexamethasone, bupivacaine-lidocaine and dexamethasone-lidocaine were not significant (P>0.05). In the third postoperative day, the difference between bupivacaine and lidocaine group found to be statistically significant (P<0.05). In the seventh post-operative day the results of bupivacaine, dexamethasone, lidocaine and placebo groups were similar (P>0.05). Bupivacaine, Dexamethasone and Lidocaine nasal aerosol decreased the pain significantly in the first postoperative day when it was compared with the placebo group. These three medicines can be used to reduce pain for children during the postoperative period applied tonsillectomy during the post-operative period. But lidocaine was more preferable, reducing pain in the third postop day better than bupivacaine.

Abstract 37 of 500

<tx1_a><tx2_a><tx3_a>Aprotinin</tx1_a></tx2_a></tx3_a> is a serine protease inhibitor that reduces blood loss and transfusion requirements when administered prophylactically to cardiac surgical patients. To examine the safety and dose-related efficacy of aprotinin, a prospective, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients undergoing repeat coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. <n>Two hundred eighty-seven</n> patients were randomly assigned to receive either <tx1>high-dose aprotinin</tx1>, <tx2>low-dose aprotinin</tx2>, <tx3>pump-prime-only aprotinin</tx3>, or <tx4>placebo</tx4>. Drug efficacy was determined by the reduction in donor-blood transfusion up to postoperative day 12 and in postoperative thoracic-drainage volume. The percentage of patients requiring donor-red-blood-cell (RBC) transfusions in the high- and <tx2_a>low-dose <tx1_a><tx3_a>aprotinin</tx1_a></tx3_a></tx2_a> groups was reduced compared with the <tx3_a>pump-prime-only</tx3_a> and <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> groups (<tx1_a>high-dose aprotinin</tx1_a>, 54%; <tx2_a>low-dose aprotinin</tx2_a>, 46%; <tx3_a>pump-prime only</tx3_a>, 72%; and <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>, 75%; overall P = .001). The number of units of donor RBCs transfused was significantly lower in the <tx1_a><tx2_a><tx3_a>aprotinin</tx1_a></tx2_a></tx3_a>-treated patients compared with <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> (<tx1_a>high-dose aprotinin</tx1_a>, 1.6 +/- 0.2 U; <tx2_a>low-dose aprotinin</tx2_a>, 1.6 +/- 0.3 U; <tx3_a>pump-prime-only</tx3_a>, 2.5 +/- 0.3 U; and <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>, 3.4 +/- 0.5 U; P = .0001). There was also a significant difference in total blood-product exposures among treatment groups (<tx1_a>high-dose aprotinin</tx1_a>, 2.2 +/- 0.4 U; <tx2_a>low-dose aprotinin</tx2_a>, 3.4 +/- 0.9 U; <tx3_a>pump-prime-only</tx3_a>, 5.1 +/- 0.9 U; <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>, 10.3 +/- 1.4 U). There were no differences among treatment groups for the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI). This study demonstrates that high- and <tx2_a>low-dose <tx1_a><tx3_a>aprotinin</tx1_a></tx3_a></tx2_a> significantly reduces the requirement for donor-blood transfusion in repeat CABG patients without increasing the risk for perioperative MI.

Abstract 38 of 500

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is impingement of the median nerve at the wrist. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of <tx3_a><tx2_a>tendon and nerve gliding exercises</tx2_a></tx3_a> with <tx1_a><tx2_a>standard conservative treatment (SCT)</tx2_a></tx1_a>, which consists of splinting and local steroid injections, in the treatment of CTS. This study was a prospective, randomized, single-blind trial. Patients were randomized into three groups: <tx1>treatment with SCT </tx1> (Group 1); <tx2><tx1_a>SCT</tx1_a> and <tx3_a>tendon and nerve gliding exercises</tx3_a></tx2> (Group 2); <tx3><tx2_a>tendon and nerve gliding exercises only</tx2_a></tx3> (Group 3). A symptom total point score was obtained from five symptoms: hand pain, tingling, numbness, nocturnal numbness, and interrupted sleep. The functional status of the hand was determined by assessing seven daily living activities: writing, buttoning clothes, gripping a telephone receiver, opening jars, doing housework, carrying grocery bags, and bathing. Standard physical examinations (Tinel's test, Phalen's test, reverse Phalen's test, and the compression test) were also performed. A total of <n>111</n> patients who were diagnosed with intermediate-stage CTS were included in the study. At the end of treatment, significant improvements in symptoms and functionality were detected in all groups. However, the recovery of patients in Groups 1 (n=<n1>41</n1>) and 2 (n=<n2>35</n2>) were found to be significantly greater than that of patients in Group 3 (n=<n3>35</n3>; P<0.001). Patient satisfaction was investigated a mean of 11 months after treatment. Percentages of asymptomatic patients in Group 1 and Group 2 were significantly higher than in Group 3 (P=0.02 and P=0.04, respectively). In the intermediate stage of CTS, <tx1_a><tx2_a>SCT</tx2_a></tx1_a> was an effective treatment to improve symptoms and functional status.<tx3_a><tx2_a>Tendon and nerve gliding</tx2_a></tx3_a> exercises alone were inferior to either <tx1_a><tx2_a>SCT</tx2_a> alone</tx1_a> or <tx2_a><tx1_a>SCT</tx1_a> in combination with gliding exercises</tx2_a>.

BiviewID 38346; PMID 19165436
Notes: I never know what to do with cases like this where on treatment (here, 2) is a combo; should mentions of either component of the tx be tagged as secondary mentions? E.g., should "tendon and nerve gliding exercises" be tagged as tx2_a since the latter includes (as one piece) the former? I go back and forth on this, but tend to opt for "yes", thinking in terms of evaluation down the road: would we really want to penalize a model for designating (only) a specific component of a combo TX?



Abstract 39 of 500

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment of nocturnal enuresis with desmopressin intranasal spray. Sixty-five children with primary nocturnal enuresis with a mean age of 11.3 years (range 7-17) underwent a 2-week observation period followed by dose titration period of 1 week. Those children completely dry with desmopressin entered a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase lasting 2 weeks, followed by a 6-month open treatment. The enuretic status of the children was documented for 2 weeks after the treatment was stopped. Eleven children had no change from baseline wetting with desmopressin. Thirty-two children receiving 20 mg and 9 children with 40 mg desmopressin were completely dry. Thirteen children were wet 1-2 nights per week, which was better than in the pretreatment period. During the 6-month open-treatment period, the effect of desmopressin was found to be stable. No side effects or adverse reactions were encountered. Two weeks after the treatment was stopped, 25 children were still completely dry (38% of the initial study population, 50% of the responders). The cure rate appeared to continue beyond 18 months after discontinuation of the treatment.

Abstract 40 of 500

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) causes memory impairment and executive function deficits in those with the condition. There is also some evidence that MCI patients are impaired in their daily functioning. Cholinesterase inhibitors have been widely used for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), with evidence of improving cognitive function. There is currently no established treatment for MCI, and cholinesterase inhibitors are beginning to be studied in these patients. <tx1>Galantamine</tx1> is a cholinesterase inhibitor that also has nicotinic receptor-modulating properties that has been successful in improving AD patients. This study examined the effects of <tx1_a>galantamine</tx1_a> in patients with MCI in areas of memory, executive functioning, and global functioning. There was a significant improvement in scores on the Functional Activities Questionnaire, which is a measure of global functioning. There were also improvements in the <tx1_a>galantamine</tx1_a> group on two of six measures in the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychiatric Test Assessment Battery and in immediate free recall on the California Verbal Learning Test.

Abstract 41 of 500

A prospective, randomized study was performed in <n>559</n> patients to compare <tx1>two doses of oral cefadroxil</tx1> with <tx2>three doses of intravenous cefuorxime</tx2> as antibiotic prophylaxis in intra- and subtrochanteric hip fracture surgery. Antibiotic concentrations in the wound fluid were determined at the start and at the end of the operation. The first dose of <tx1_a>cefadroxil</tx1_a> was given about 2 h before surgery and <tx2_a>cefuroxime</tx2_a> about 30 min before operation. In 226/<n1>242</n1> (93%) patients randomized to oral <tx1_a>cefadroxil</tx1_a>, the concentration in the wound during surgery was on average 15 micrograms/ml, i.e., well above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC-90) for Staphylococcus aureus. In the <tx2_a>cefuroxime</tx2_a> group, antibiotic levels in the wound exceeded the MIC-90 for S. aureus in 204/<n2>210</n2> (97%) of the patients at the start and/or at the end of surgery. All patients were followed up for 4 months. One deep and five superficial infections occurred in the <tx2_a>cefuroxime</tx2_a> group and no deep but one superficial infection in the <tx2_a>cefadroxil</tx2_a> group (P = 0.07). S. aureus was cultured in three of the infected cases while cultures were negative in four patients. Four of the seven infected patients had adequate levels of antibiotic in the wound during surgery, and in three patients no antibiotic assay was performed. The infected patients did not differ in age, sex, operation time, bleeding or any other basic variable compared with patients who healed without complications. Two doses of <tx1_a>cefadroxil</tx1_a> seems to be practical and as effective as intravenously administered <tx2_a>cefuroxime</tx2_a> as antibiotic prophylaxis in trochanteric hip fracture surgery.

Abstract 42 of 500

Increasing evidence supports n-3 fatty acid (FA) supplementation for patients with psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the exact metabolic fate of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on different glyceride carriers remains unclear. We investigated whether conjugation of EPA and DHA to phospholipid (PL-n-3) or to triacylglycerol (fish oil; FO) affects their incorporation in blood compartments and influences executive functioning. Children aged 8-13 y with impaired visual sustained attention performance received placebo, 250 mg/d EPA + DHA esterified to PL-n-3 (300 mg/d phosphatidylserine), or FO for 3 mo in a randomized double-blind manner. Main outcome measures included plasma and erythrocyte FA profile and continuous performance test results (Test of Variables of Attention; TOVA). Sixty of the 83 children enrolled completed the interventions (n = 18-21 per group). There was an enrichment of EPA (1.5-2.2-fold), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 1.2-fold), and DHA (1.3-fold) in the PL fraction in the plasma of FO- and PL-n-3-fed children. In erythrocytes, only PL-n-3 resulted in a significant reduction (approximately 30%) of very-long-chain saturated FAs (C20-24) and in an increase (1.2- and 2.2-fold, respectively) in linoleic acid and DPA. Total TOVA scores increased in the PL-n-3 (mean +/- SD: 3.35 +/- 1.86) and FO (1.72 +/- 1.67) groups but not in the placebo group (-0.42 +/- 2.51) (PL-n-3 > FO > placebo; P < 0.001). A significant correlation between the alterations in FAs and increased TOVA scores mainly occurred in the PL-n-3 group. Consumption of EPA+DHA esterified to different carriers had different effects on the incorporation of these FAs in blood fractions and on the visual sustained attention performance in children. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00382616.

Abstract 43 of 500

Treatment with thiazolidinediones (TZDs) produces weight gain. To test whether a portion control diet could prevent weight gain during treatment with <tx1_a><tx2_a>pioglitazone</tx2_a></tx1_a> in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This 16-week randomized, open-label, parallel arm study compared three groups: (i) <tx1>pioglitazone plus the American Diabetes Association diet (Pio + ADA)</tx1>; (ii) <tx2>pioglitazone plus a portion control weight loss diet (Pio + PC)</tx2>; (iii) <tx3>metformin plus the American Diabetes Association diet (Met + ADA)</tx3>. All participants received the same <tx>advice about calorie reduction, lifestyle change and exercise</tx>. <n>Fifty-one</n> men and women with T2DM, naive to TZDs, were randomized to a 16-week study. <tx1_a><tx2_a>Pioglitazone (Pio)</tx1_a></tx2_a> was titrated to a dose of 45 mg/day and <tx3_a>metformin (Met)</tx3_a> to a dose of 2 g/day. Fasting blood was collected for lipids, insulin and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at baseline and 16 weeks. Forty-eight of <n_a>fifty-one</n_a> randomized subjects completed the study. Patients treated with <tx1_a>Pio + ADA</tx1_a> gained 2.15 +/- 1.09 kg (mean +/- SD) compared with a weight loss of 2.59 +/- 1.25 kg (p < 0.05) in the <tx2_a>Pio + PC</tx2_a> group, and a weight loss of 3.21 +/- 0.7 kg (p < 0.05) in the <tx3_a>Met + ADA</tx3_a> group. Waist circumference and visceral adipose tissue decreased significantly more in the <tx2_a>Pio + PC</tx2_a> group than in the <tx1_a>Pio + ADA</tx1_a> group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly increased in the <tx2_a>Pio + PC</tx2_a> group compared with the <tx3_a>Met + ADA</tx3_a> group. <tx1_a><tx2_a>Pioglitazone</tx1_a></tx2_a> reduced insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) more than <tx3_a>metformin</tx3_a>. No significant differences between groups were seen for glucose, insulin, HbA1c or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. <tx2_a>Pio + PC</tx2_a>, prevented weight gain, reduced waist circumference and visceral fat compared with <tx1_a>Pio + ADA</tx1_a> diet.

Abstract 44 of 500

This is a double blind, <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of <tx1_a><tx3_a>disulfiram</tx3_a></tx1_a>, <tx2_a><tx3_a>naltrexone</tx3_a></tx2_a> and their <tx3_a>combination</tx3_a> in patients with co-occurring cocaine and alcohol dependence. <n>208</n> patients were randomized to <tx1><tx3_a>disulfiram (250 mg/day)</tx3_a></tx1>, <tx2><tx3_a>naltrexone (100 mg/day)</tx3_a></tx2>, <tx3>the combination</tx3>, or <tx4>placebo</tx4> for 11 weeks. Outcomes were in-trial abstinence from cocaine and/or alcohol. Few safety concerns were reported, although medication adherence was low in a number of patients for both medications, alone or in combination. In the primary analyses (GEE modeling), abstinence from cocaine as measured by cocaine-negative urines and days of self-reported abstinence from cocaine or alcohol did not differ between <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> and any of the medication groups. However, patients taking <tx1_a><tx3_a>disulfiram</tx3_a></tx1_a> (alone or in combination) were most likely to achieve combined abstinence from cocaine and alcohol. Secondary analyses revealed that patients taking the <tx3_a>disulfiram-naltrexone combination</tx3_a> were most likely to achieve 3 consecutive weeks of abstinence from cocaine and alcohol. There was an association between <tx1_a><tx3_a>disulfiram</tx1_a></tx3_a> treatment and abstinence from cocaine and alcohol. More patients taking the <tx3_a>disulfiram-naltrexone combination</tx3_a> achieved 3 consecutive weeks of abstinence in treatment than <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>-treated patients.

Abstract 45 of 500

Ninety-two eyes with newly-diagnosed chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG) were treated in a randomised prospective trial with either timolol or pilocarpine. Their visual field survival was monitored on a 3-monthly basis over 2 years using both Goldmann and Friedmann perimetry. Concomitant tonometric data was derived by applanation. Fields were assessed and quantified using algorithms designed to give the greatest sensitivity for glaucomatous field loss. Microcomputer programmes specifically designed for this purpose were used in the data collection and subsequent analysis.

Abstract 46 of 500

To compare the efficacy and safety of <tx2_a>lamotrigine</tx2_a> and <tx1_a>amitriptyline</tx1_a> in controlling chronic painful peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients. A randomized, double-blind, crossover, active-control, clinical trial with variable dose titration was carried out (n = <n>53</n>). <tx1>Amitriptyline orally, at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg at night-time, each dose for 2 weeks</tx1>, and <tx2>lamotrigine orally, at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg twice daily, each dose for 2 weeks</tx2>, by optional titration were used. There was a <tx3>placebo</tx3> washout period for 2 weeks between the two drugs. Assessment for pain relief, overall improvement and adverse events were carried out. Good, moderate and mild pain relief were noted in 19 (41%), six (13%) and seven (15%) patients on <tx2_a>lamotrigine</tx2_a> and 13 (28%), five (11%) and 15 (33%) patients on <tx1_a>amitriptyline</tx1_a>, respectively, by patient's global assessment of efficacy and safety. Patient and physicians global assessment, McGill pain questionnaire and Likert pain scale showed no significant difference between the treatments, although improvement with both treatments was seen from 2 weeks. Of the 44 adverse events reported, 33 (75%) were with <tx1_a>amitriptyline</tx1_a>, sedation being the commonest [in 19 (43%) patients]. <tx2_a>Lamotrigine</tx2_a> caused adverse events in 11 (25%), of which rash in three (7%) and elevations of creatinine in four (9%) were the most common. The preferred <tx2_a>lamotrigine</tx2_a> dose was 25 mg twice daily. As there are few differences between the two treatments in efficacy, <tx2_a>lamotrigine 25 mg twice daily</tx2_a> might be the first choice as it is associated with fewer adverse effects in our population.

Abstract 48 of 500

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22921 four-arm randomised trial questioned the value of preoperative chemoradiation (XRT-CT) versus preoperative radiation (XRT) and the value of additional postoperative chemotherapy (CT) versus none in T3-T4 M0 resectable rectal cancer patients. We report on the preoperative toxicity, treatment compliance and early deaths (all deaths up to 30 days after surgery) of the two treatment modalities in patients who were entered into trial before January 2001. In the XRT Group (group A), patients received 45 Gy, 25 fractions over 5 weeks. In the XRT-CT Group (group B), two 5-day courses of CT were added to the first and fifth weeks of XRT. For each CT course: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 350 mg/m2/day and Leucovorin (LV) 20 mg/m2/day were given. 398 and 400 patients started treatment in groups A and B, respectively. Grade 2+acute diarrhoea occurred in 17.3 and 34.3% of patients in groups A and B, respectively (P<0.005). The other side-effects remained unchanged or were only marginally increased. The compliance with RT was 98.5 and 95.5% in groups A and B, respectively. In group B, 78.7 and 71.1% of the patients received 95-105% of the planned CT doses at the first and second courses, respectively. 6 patients died preoperatively, 2 from toxicity in group B. 8 patients (1%) died within the 30 days after surgery in both groups. At the doses recommended in the protocol, the addition of 5-FU-LV to preoperative XRT slightly increased the amount of acute toxicity. However, the compliance with the radiation protocol or the feasibility of surgery did not decrease.

Abstract 49 of 500

Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation (LTI) often provoke an undesirable increase in blood pressure (BP) and/or heart rate (HR). We tested the premise that <tx1_a><tx3_a>nicardipine (NIC)</tx3_a></tx1_a> and <tx2_a><tx3_a>esmolol (ESM)</tx3_a></tx2_a> in <tx3_a>combination (COMB)</tx3_a> would oppose both. Adult surgical patients received pretreatment (randomized) with IV <tx1><tx3_a>bolus NIC 30 microg/kg</tx3_a></tx1> (n = <n1>31</n1>), <tx2><tx3_a>ESM 1.0 mg/kg</tx3_a></tx2> (n = <n2>34</n2>), or <tx3>COMB (one-half dose each</tx3>, n = <n3>32</n3>). Peak BP and HR after LTI were compared with controls (CONT; n = 35) with no pretreatment. Anesthetic induction was standardized: IV thiopental (5-7 mg/kg), fentanyl (1-2 microg/kg), and succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg). Systolic (S), diastolic (D), and mean (M) BP and HR awake before pretreatment (baseline) were similar in all test groups. No patient was treated for hypotension, bradycardia, or tachycardia after pretreatment or anesthetic induction. Peak HR after LTI was increased versus baseline in CONT and all test groups, but did not differ from CONT among the test groups. Peak SBP and DBP increased versus baseline in CONT, and with <tx1_a><tx3_a>ESM</tx3_a></tx1_a> and <tx2_a><tx3_a>NIC</tx2_a></tx3_a>, but not <tx3_a>COMB</tx3_a>. Peak SBP, DBP, and MBP were increased with <tx1_a><tx3_a>ESM</tx3_a></tx1_a> versus COMB, and peak DBP with <tx1_a><tx3_a>ESM</tx3_a></tx1_a> versus <tx2_a><tx3_a>NIC</tx2_a></tx3_a>. Compared with no pretreatment before the IV induction of general anesthesia, the peak increase in BP after LTI is best blunted by the combination of <tx2_a><tx3_a>nicardipine</tx3_a></tx2_a> and <tx1_a><tx3_a>ESM</tx3_a></tx1_a>, compared with either drug alone. No single drug or <tx3_a>combination</tx3_a> in the doses tested opposed increased HR. Compared with no pretreatment before the IV induction of general anesthesia, the peak increase in blood pressure after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation is best blunted by the combination of <tx2_a><tx3_a>nicardipine</tx3_a></tx2_a> and <tx1_a><tx3_a>esmolol</tx3_a></tx1_a>, compared with either drug alone. No single drug or <tx3_a>combination</tx3_a> in the doses tested opposed increased heart rate.

Abstract 50 of 500

A total of <n>110</n> children with acute otitis media were assigned randomly to treatment with <tx1>60 mg/kg per day <tx2_a>amoxicillin</tx2_a> in a twice-daily</tx1> (group A) or a <tx2>thrice-daily (group B) regimen for 10 days</tx2>. Patients were scheduled for follow-up examinations at mid-treatment, 5 days after the end of therapy and 30, 60, 90 days after starting therapy. At 15 days 6 out of <n1>55</n1> patients (10.9%) treated with <tx1_a><tx2_a>amoxicillin</tx2_a> twice daily</tx1_a> were considered treatment failures compared to 4 children (7.2%) in the <tx2_a>thrice daily</tx2_a> group. Rates of cure, recurrent otitis media and persistent middle ear effusion were comparable in the two groups of patients at later time intervals. By 90 days the total cure rate was 42.3% (22/52) in children treated <tx1_a>twice daily</tx1_a> and 41.5% (22/53) in those who had received <tx2_a><tx1_a>amoxicillin</tx1_a> thrice daily</tx2_a>. At the same time persistence of bilateral and unilateral effusion was noted in 12/52 (23.1%) and 8/52 (15.3%) children in group A and in 16/53 (30.1%) and in 10/53 (18.9%) in group B respectively. No significant difference was noted in the two treatment regimens with regard to adverse side effects. Because reduction in division of the <tx1_a><tx2_a>amoxicillin</tx1_a></tx2_a> dose caused no significant difference in the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media in infants and children, we think that this simplified scheme of therapy can routinely be used in clinical practice and thus improve compliance to antibiotic administration.

Abstract 51 of 500

We compared concomitant cisplatin and irradiation with radiotherapy alone as adjuvant treatment for stage III or IV head and neck cancer. After undergoing surgery with curative intent, 167 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (66 Gy over a period of 6 1/2 weeks) and 167 to receive the same radiotherapy regimen combined with 100 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area on days 1, 22, and 43 of the radiotherapy regimen. After a median follow-up of 60 months, the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (P=0.04 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.99), with 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival of 47 percent and 36 percent, respectively. The overall survival rate was also significantly higher in the combined-therapy group than in the radiotherapy group (P=0.02 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.95), with five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival of 53 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The cumulative incidence of local or regional relapses was significantly lower in the combined-therapy group (P=0.007). The estimated five-year cumulative incidence of local or regional relapses (considering death from other causes as a competing risk) was 31 percent after radiotherapy and 18 percent after combined therapy. Severe (grade 3 or higher) adverse effects were more frequent after combined therapy (41 percent) than after radiotherapy (21 percent, P=0.001); the types of severe mucosal adverse effects were similar in the two groups, as was the incidence of late adverse effects. Postoperative concurrent administration of high-dose cisplatin with radiotherapy is more efficacious than radiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer and does not cause an undue number of late complications.

Abstract 52 of 500

Excessive production of sputum is one of the major symptoms in patients with chronic airway diseases. Because endogenous prostaglandins may play a role in the regulation of airway secretions, blockade of cyclooxygenase pathway with <tx1_a>indomethacin</tx1_a> could decrease respiratory tract fluid and mucus by inhibiting Cl secretion and glandular secretion and by enhancing Na absorption across airway mucosa. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of <tx1_a>inhaled indomethacin on bronchorrhea</tx1_a> in patients with chronic bronchitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, and bronchiectasis in a double-blind, <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled fashion. Patients who inhaled <tx1>2 ml of indomethacin (1.2 micrograms/ml) three times a day for 14 days</tx1> showed a decrease in the amount of sputum, from 189 +/- 19 to 95 +/- 21 g/day (p less than 0.001) and an increase in the solid component of sputum without alterations in parameters of systemic inflammatory responses. Although pulmonary function remained unchanged, perceived dyspnea was improved so that Borg's ratio scale was decreased from 7.1 +/- 0.5 to 4.5 +/- 0.4 (p less than 0.01). Adverse effects, including hypotension and bronchoconstriction, were not observed. The reduction of sputum was accompanied by a significant decrease in the concentrations of prostaglandin (PG)E2, PGF2 alpha, thromboxane B2, and 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha in the sputum. Thus, <tx1_a>indomethacin inhalation</tx1_a> may be of value in reducing bronchorrhea sputum, probably through the inhibition of PG-dependent airway secretions.

Abstract 53 of 500

The long-term complications of immunosuppressive therapy such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension are a major source of morbidity in liver transplant recipients. In this prospective, randomized, open-label study we completely withdrew prednisone (PRED) 14 days after liver transplantation in an effort to decrease these metabolic complications. Patients were maintained on <tx>mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)</tx> in combination with either <tx1>cyclosporine (CsA; Neoral formulation)</tx1> or <tx2>tacrolimus (TAC)</tx2>. Thus, we also were able to compare <tx1_a>CsA</tx1_a> to <tx2_a>TAC</tx2_a> in patients not receiving PRED with respect to efficacy, toxicity, and effect on posttransplant metabolic complications. A total of <n>71</n> patients were randomized to receive either <tx2_a>TAC-MMF</tx2_a> (n=<n1>35</n1>) or <tx1>CsA-MMF</tx1> (n=<n2>36</n2>) after liver transplantation and were analyzed for patient and graft survival. Fifty-eight patients continued the immunosuppressive protocol for at least 6 months after transplantation and were analyzed for the incidence of acute rejection and the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. The 6-month patient survival rates were 94.4% for <tx1_a>CsA-MMF</tx1_a> and 88.6% for <tx2_a>TAC-MMF</tx2_a>. Corresponding 6-month graft survival rates were 88.7% and 85.71% with no immunologic graft losses in either group. The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was 46% for <tx1_a>CsA-MMF</tx1_a> and 42.3% for <tx2_a>TAC-MMF</tx2_a>. Six patients were converted from <tx1_a>CsA</tx1_a> to <tx2_a>TAC</tx2_a> (four for recurrent rejection) and seven patients were converted from <tx2_a>TAC</tx2_a> to <tx1_a>CsA</tx1_a> (four for neurotoxicity). Only one patient (in the <tx2_a>TAC-MMF</tx2_a> group) developed new-onset posttransplant diabetes. In contrast, four of eight patients in the <tx1_a>CsA-MMF</tx1_a> group who were diabetic before transplant became nondiabetic in the first 3 months after transplant. The mean serum cholesterol level was significantly lower in the <tx2_a>TAC-MMF</tx2_a> group than in the <tx1_a>CsA-MMF</tx1_a> group (145.2+/-41.8 mg/dl and 190.3+/-62.2, respectively; P<0.001) and the incidence of hypertension was lower in the <tx2_a>TAC-MMF</tx2_a> group (12% vs. 30.3% in the <tx1_a>CsA-MMF</tx1_a> group, P<0.01). Both groups had a lower incidence of metabolic complications compared with a historical group (n=100) maintained on <tx1_a>CsA</tx1_a> and PRED (10 mg/day at 6 months). <tx_a>MMF</tx_a> in combination with either <tx2_a>TAC</tx2_a> or <tx1_a>CsA</tx1_a> allows withdrawal of PRED 14 days after liver transplantation with a moderate rejection rate and no immunologic graft losses. Early PRED withdrawal decreases posttransplant diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, but patients maintained on <tx2_a>TAC</tx2_a> have lower serum cholesterol levels and a lower incidence of hypertension than <tx1_a>CsA</tx1_a>-treated patients.

Abstract 54 of 500

Oxygen desaturation and subclinical coronary artery disease may predispose older patients with chronic airflow obstruction to cardiac arrhythmias, especially when high concentrations of theophylline are present in the blood. To assess the safety and efficacy of Uniphyl tablets, an oral theophylline preparation formulated for once-daily dosing, in elderly patients with chronic airflow obstruction, we conducted a randomized, three-phase, double-blind crossover study comparing evening dosing with Uniphyl tablets, Theo-Dur tablets administered twice daily, and placebo. The patients in the study were scheduled to receive each treatment for two weeks. Each day, symptoms, side effects, peak expiratory flow rates, and use of metered-dose inhalers were recorded. Near the end of each phase, serum theophylline concentrations were measured every two hours between 8:00 A.M. and 8:00 P.M. on two consecutive days. The patients underwent ambulatory Holter monitoring during the final 48 hours of each phase. Twelve patients completed the active-drug phases of the study, but seven of the 12 were removed from the placebo phase because of increasing symptom severity. The difference between the number of patients completing the active-drug and placebo phases was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Treatment with Uniphyl tablets resulted in a significantly (p less than 0.05) greater increase in peak expiratory flow rate than Theo-Dur tablet therapy, and both active drugs increased peak expiratory flow rate more than placebo. Circadian variation in peak expiratory flow rate was seen during the placebo and Theo-Dur tablet phases but not during the Uniphyl tablet phase. Symptoms and side effects were similar during the two active-drug phases. Cardiac ectopy was observed in most of the patients, but it was not significantly greater during the theophylline phases than during the placebo phase. Furthermore, ectopic activity was not directly related to the times of maximal serum theophylline concentration.

Abstract 55 of 500

<n>Nine</n> obese patients with Type II diabetes mellitus were examined in a double-blind cross-over study. <tx1>Metformin 0.5 g trice daily</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2> were given for 4 weeks. At the end of each period fasting and day-time postprandial values of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and lactate were determined, and in vivo insulin action was assessed using the euglycemic clamp in combination with [3-3H]glucose tracer technique. <tx1_a>Metformin</tx1_a> treatment significantly reduced mean day-time plasma glucose levels (10.2 +/- 1.2 vs 11.4 +/- 1.2 mmol/l, P less than 0.01) without enhancing mean day-time plasma insulin (43 +/- 4 vs 50 +/- 7 mU/l, NS) or C-peptide levels (1.26 +/- 0.12 vs 1.38 +/- 0.18 nmol/l, NS). Fasting plasma lactate was unchanged (1.57 +/- 0.16 vs 1.44 +/- 0.11 mmol/l, NS), whereas mean day-time plasma lactate concentrations were slightly increased (1.78 +/- 0.11 vs 1.38 +/- 0.11 mmol/l, P less than 0.01). The clamp study revealed that <tx1_a>metformin</tx1_a> treatment was associated with an enhanced insulin-mediated glucose utilization (370 +/- 38 vs 313 +/- 33 mg.m-2.min-1, P less than 0.01), whereas insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production was unchanged. Also basal glucose clearance was improved (61.0 +/- 5.8 vs 50.6 +/- 2.8 ml.m-2.min-1, P less than 0.05), whereas basal hepatic glucose production was unchanged (81 +/- 6 vs 77 +/- 4 mg.m-2.min-1, NS). Conclusions: 1) <tx1_a>Metformin</tx1_a> treatment in obese Type II diabetic patients reduces hyperglycemia without changing the insulin secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract 56 of 500

In order to assess the efficacy of a combination of systemic and nebulized corticosteroids in reducing the incidence and severity of chronic lung disease (CLD) in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants, <n>60</n> ventilator-dependent infants < or = 1500 g were randomly assigned to receive either <tx1_a>steroids</tx1_a> or <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> as of 7 d. The steroid group (n = <n1>30</n1>, GA = 25.8 +/- 1.6 weeks, BW = 731 +/- 147 g) received <tx1>systemic dexamethasone for 3 d, followed by nebulized budesonide for 18 d</tx1>. Control infants (n = <n2>30</n2>, GA = 25.9 +/- 1.8 weeks, BW = 796 +/- 199 g) received <tx2>systemic and inhaled saline</tx2>. <tx1_a>Steroid</tx1_a>-treated infants required less ventilatory support between 9 and 17 d (p < 0.01), and had greater lung compliance at 10 d (p = 0.01), but not subsequently. CLD incidence at 36 weeks was 45.5% vs 56.0% in controls, and fewer <tx1_a>steroid</tx1_a>-treated infants required dexamethasone rescue (23.3% vs 56.7%, p = 0.017). Survival to discharge was similar (73.3% vs 83.3%), as were the durations of mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen use, and hospitalization. Tracheal effluent elastase/albumin ratios and serum cortisol values did not differ between groups, and no adverse effects were noted. We conclude that early <tx1_a>dexamethasone</tx1_a> administration was associated with improved pulmonary function, which was not sustained with <tx1_a>nebulized budesonide</tx1_a>. However, the <tx1_a>steroid</tx1_a> regimen studied reduced the need for dexamethasone rescue in infants with CLD.

Abstract 57 of 500

One hundred and fifty bilateral breast reductions were prospectively randomised intra-operatively to receive a unilateral wound drain. Seven patients required post-operative evacuation of haematoma, three on the drained and four on the undrained sides. There was no statistical difference in haematoma formation between drained and undrained sides (p = 1), or the incidence of wound healing or other complications. We believe that routine wound drainage in breast reduction surgery is an unnecessary intervention.

Abstract 58 of 500

<tx1>Oxamniquine</tx1> proved to be an efficient drug for the treatment of Schistosoma mansoni in adults. The cure rate obtained with a single oral dose of 15 mg/kg was 81.3 per cent. With 15 mg given b.d. for a single day the cure rate was 90 per cent. Post-treatment reduction of egg count was 93.7 and 95 per cent respectively within three months follow-up period. The drug, given by the oral route, was well tolerated, non-toxic, and side-effects were evanescent. Further studies are needed to indicate its use for mass treatment and control of schistosomiasis.

Abstract 59 of 500

<n>Forty-eight</n> patients (13 men and 35 women) took part in a double-blind randomized study. All patients received a <tx>placebo daily for 4 weeks</tx> (period A), at the end of which the frequency and severity of headaches experienced by each patient were assessed. Patients then received an active drug for 12 weeks (period B). Sixteen patients received <tx1>nadolol, 80 mg/day</tx1>; 16 received <tx2>nadolol, 160 mg/day</tx2>; and 16 received <tx3>propranolol, 160 mg/day</tx3>. The frequency and severity of headaches in the three groups were tabulated at the end of period B, as were the side effects. Only three subjects dropped out during the study, and one of these needed abdominal surgery. All three groups reported improvement, the most noticeable being in those patients who received <tx1_a>80 mg of nadolol daily</tx1_a>.

Abstract 60 of 500

The objective of the study was to examine whether patients with schizophrenia who were judged to be stable on long-term treatment with conventional antipsychotic medications would further benefit from a switch to an atypical antipsychotic drug. Thirty-six subjects with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, on conventional antipsychotic medication therapy for at least 2 years, were randomized in double-blind fashion to risperidone versus olanzapine. Patients were titrated up to 6 mg risperidone or 15 mg olanzapine as tolerated, followed by tapering and discontinuation of conventional antipsychotic medication. Atypical antipsychotic agents were then administered alone (monotherapy) for 12 weeks. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale, and Simpson Angus Scale. Body weight was measured at each visit. Both treatment groups exhibited marked and similar improvement in the total PANSS score from baseline to study endpoint (22 weeks) [risperidone: baseline=59.3 (SE 3.1), 22 weeks=44.3 (SE 2.3) (p<0.001); olanzapine: baseline=55.9 (SE 3.3), 22 weeks=46.9 (SE 3.2) (p<0.001). Both groups also exhibited significant reductions in PANSS factor scores for positive and negative symptoms and disorganized thoughts. Only risperidone-treated patients exhibited significant decreases in uncontrolled hostility/excitement and anxiety and depression. Of note, while positive factor scores exhibited the majority of change within the first 10 weeks, negative factor scores continued to decline significantly in both treatment groups throughout the study. Tolerability assessments did not differ between groups. The results indicate that both atypical antipsychotic medications provided significant additional improvement in symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia previously on conventional antipsychotic agents.

Abstract 61 of 500

The need for <tx1_a>antibiotic treatment</tx1_a> when performing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not be as important as it is thought. This study assesses the real efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy with respect to the postoperative infection rate. A prospective randomized study on the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. University teaching hospital, La Sapienza, Italy. <n>Eighty-four</n> patients randomly placed into 2 groups (A [n = <n1>44</n1>] and B [n = <n2>40</n2>]) immediately before undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Before anesthesia was administered, group A received <tx1>intravenously 2 g of cefotaxime sodium diluted in 100 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution</tx1>; group B, <tx2>10 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution in 100 mL of saline</tx2>. A gallbladder bile sample for culture was withdrawn intraoperatively from all patients. In both groups, age, sex, weight, duration of surgery, presence of diabetes, American Society of Anesthesiologists patient classification score, preoperative autologous blood donation, antibiotic administration, intraoperative gallbladder rupture, findings from bile culture positive for bacteria, episodes of colic within 30 days before surgery, length of postoperative hospital stay, and number of septic complications were recorded. All data were correlated by univariate and multivariate analyses with the onset of septic phenomena. In group A, 3 cases of wound infection, 1 case of subhepatic abscess from bile leakage, and 1 case of urinary tract infection were observed; group B, 4 cases of wound infection, 1 case of bronchopneumonia, and 2 cases of urinary tract infection. Comparison of data showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. Findings from bile examination in patients with sepsis complications were positive in 5 patients in group A and in 6 in group B (P = .91). Multivariate analysis showed diabetes mellitus and colic episodes within 30 days before surgery as independent factors significantly associated to the onset of infectious complications. In elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, <tx1_a>antibiotic treatment</tx1_a> did not seem to affect the incidence and severity of infections or the degree of bile contamination.

Abstract 62 of 500

The efficacy of antidepressants as analgesics for a range of chronic pain problems is well documented. However, a controlled trial of an antidepressant for women with chronic pelvic pain has not yet been published. We randomized <n>23</n> women from a general gynecology clinic to either double-blind <tx1>sertraline</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2>. Measures of psychological function, pain, and functional disability were taken at baseline and 6 weeks. After a 2-week washout, the groups were crossed-over and the same measures were done over the next 6 weeks. There were no significant improvements in pain or functional disability noted on <tx1_a>sertraline</tx1_a> compared to <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>. Studies involving larger samples of patients are needed to confirm these findings.

Abstract 63 of 500

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity was studied in 28 endogenously depressed, hospitalized patients. Measures of HPA activity obtained were baseline serum cortisol level, 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion, and an overnight 2-mg dexamethasone suppression test. The patients then received double-blind and randomized treatment with imipramine hydrochloride, 150 mg daily, or amitriptyline hydrochloride, 150 mg daily, for four weeks. Four-week treatment response of all patients was compared with pretreatment HPA axis variables, and higher cortisol values after dexamethasone administration were found to be significantly correlated with greater improvement. There were no significant differences between imipramine and amitriptyline response, however, when improvement with each drug was compared with the pretreatment HPA variables.

Abstract 64 of 500

Actinic keratoses (AKs) are premalignant skin lesions caused by excessive sun exposure. To explore the therapeutic efficacy of <tx1_a>3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyaluronan gel</tx1_a> in the topical treatment of AK. Sixty-four lesions in <n>20</n> patients were evaluated. They were randomized to receive either the active treatment, <tx1>3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyaluronan gel</tx1> or <tx2>placebo, which consisted of the inactive gel vehicle, hyaluronan</tx2> for a period of three months. The collected data were analyzed by using Student t- tests. There was a reduction in the lesion size in 64.7% of <tx1_a>diclofenac</tx1_a>-treated lesions and 34.3% of control lesions during the three-month course of treatment. Only 9.3% of the lesions in the <tx1_a>diclofenac</tx1_a> group were completely cleared during three months of treatment. During the treatment, no significant side-effect was observed in both groups. Considering the malignant potential of actinic keratoses and the importance of clearing them to prevent their transformation to squamous cell carcinoma, the efficacy of <tx1_a>diclofenac gel</tx1_a> seen in our study seems to be low. This treatment may be useful for patients who do not tolerate other, more effective kinds of treatment for actinic keratoses.

Abstract 65 of 500

This study addressed two major questions regarding therapeutic use of <tx>Adriamycin ([Adr] Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH)</tx> in adult soft tissue sarcomas: the influence of dosing schedule and the value of adding <tx3_a>imidazole carboxamide (DTIC)</tx3_a> to <tx_a>Adr</tx_a>. Patients with objectively measurable metastatic soft tissue sarcomas were randomized to <tx1><tx_a>Adr</tx_a> 70 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1 and every 3 weeks</tx1> (<n1>94</n1> patients); <tx2><tx_a>Adr</tx_a> 20 mg/m2 IV day 1, 2, and 3, and 15 mg/m2 IV day 8 and weekly thereafter</tx2> (<n2>89</n2> patients); and <tx3><tx_a>Adr</tx_a> 60 mg/m2 IV day 1 and DTIC 250 mg/m2 days 1 to 5, repeated every 3 weeks</tx3> (<n3>92</n3> patients). The regimens using <tx_a>Adr</tx_a> as a single agent resulted in an equivalent response frequency (18% and 16%) and survival (median, 8.0 and 8.4 months). <tx3_a>DTIC</tx3_a> significantly increased (P less than .02) the overall response frequency of <tx_a>Adr</tx_a> to 30%. However, <tx3_a>DTIC</tx3_a> did not influence survival (median, 8.0 months) or increase the number of complete responses. The toxicities of the two single-agent regimens differed: <tx2_a><tx_a>Adr</tx_a> weekly</tx2_a> resulted in more stomatitis (P = .09) and less hematologic toxicity (P less than .05). <tx3_a>DTIC</tx3_a> resulted in substantially increased toxicity, primarily gastrointestinal (P less than .002); overall, 98% of patients receiving <tx3_a><tx_a>Adr</tx_a>-DTIC</tx3_a> experienced moderate or worse toxicity. To decrease the potential for error in interpretation of treatment results, histopathological confirmation of diagnosis was undertaken by a panel of reference pathologists; pathology slides were submitted on 97% of entered patients. The on-study clinical diagnosis was affirmed in 199 of <n>316</n> patients (63%) with a final review. In 23% of patients, the panel agreed with the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, but not with the type. In 14%, the panel concluded that a diagnosis of mesenchymal malignancy could not be affirmed. Final treatment results were based on the 275 pathologically confirmed, eligible patients. The most common histological subtype entered was leiomyosarcoma (99 patients). The response to <tx3_a><tx_a>Adr</tx_a>-DTIC</tx3_a> of this subtype was higher (44%) than that of any other subtype. However, this difference alone was not responsible for the overall superiority of the combination. This confirmed that the combination of DTIC plus <tx_a>Adr</tx_a> adds to the response rate of <tx_a>Adr</tx_a> alone in soft tissue sarcomas. Whether the increased response frequency, without an impact on survival, is worth the significantly greater toxicity remains a subjective judgement that must be made within the context of the individual patient.

Abstract 66 of 500

Prophylactic zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce diarrhea and respiratory illness in children in many developing countries, but its efficacy in children in Africa is uncertain. To determine if zinc, or zinc plus multiple micronutrients, reduces diarrhea and respiratory disease prevalence. Randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Rural community in South Africa. THREE COHORTS: 32 HIV-infected children; 154 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers; and 187 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-uninfected mothers. Children received either 1250 IU of vitamin A; vitamin A and 10 mg of zinc; or vitamin A, zinc, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, E, and K and copper, iodine, iron, and niacin starting at 6 months and continuing to 24 months of age. Homes were visited weekly. Primary outcome was percentage of days of diarrhea per child by study arm within each of the three cohorts. Secondary outcomes were prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms and percentage of children who ever had pneumonia by maternal report, or confirmed by the field worker. Among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers, median percentage of days with diarrhea was 2.3% for 49 children allocated to vitamin A; 2.5% in 47 children allocated to receive vitamin A and zinc; and 2.2% for 46 children allocated to multiple micronutrients (P = 0.852). Among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-uninfected mothers, median percentage of days of diarrhea was 2.4% in 56 children in the vitamin A group; 1.8% in 57 children in the vitamin A and zinc group; and 2.7% in 52 children in the multiple micronutrient group (P = 0.857). Only 32 HIV-infected children were enrolled, and there were no differences between treatment arms in the prevalence of diarrhea. The prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms or incidence of pneumonia did not differ by treatment arms in any of the cohorts. When compared with vitamin A alone, supplementation with zinc, or with zinc and multiple micronutrients, did not reduce diarrhea and respiratory morbidity in rural South African children.

Abstract 67 of 500

This study was designed to evaluate the anxiolytic efficacy of <tx1_a>buspirone</tx1_a> in patients with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with coexisting mild depressive symptoms. Patients who participated in this multicenter study scored >/= 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and between 12 and 17 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Following a <tx>7- to 10-day placebo</tx> lead-in phase, patients who continued to qualify were randomly assigned to receive either <tx1>buspirone titrated from 15 to 45 mg/day</tx1> (N = <n1>80</n1>) or <tx2>placebo</tx2> (N = <n2>82</n2>) for the next 6 weeks. 121 patients completed 6 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy measure was the HAM-A, taken weekly during the study. <tx1_a>Buspirone</tx1_a>-treated patients averaged a 12.4-point reduction from their baseline total HAM-A score of 24.9, while their counterparts on <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> averaged a 9.5-point reduction from their mean baseline total HAM-A score of 25.6. This 2.9-point difference in HAM-A reductions between treatment groups was significantly different (p < .03). <tx1_a>Buspirone</tx1_a> patients decreased their HAM-D scores by an average 5.7 points from their mean baseline total HAM-D score of 15.8, while <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> patients decreased their HAM-D scores by an average 3.5 points from their mean baseline score of 16.3 (p < .05). Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar for both treatment groups, but <tx1_a>buspirone</tx1_a>-treated patients reported significantly more nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and sweating than <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> patients. <tx1_a>Buspirone</tx1_a> is superior to <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in GAD patients who have coexisting depressive symptoms.

Abstract 68 of 500

Diabetic dyslipidemia is featured by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol commonly in the form of small, dense LDL particles. First-line treatment, fibrates versus statins or both, of dyslipidemia in diabetic patients has been the focus of debate. We investigated the potential hypolipidemic effects of <tx1_a>atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor with good triglyceride lowering properties</tx1_a>, in patients with combined dyslipidemia and evidence of impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes. <n>Twenty</n> patients were recruited for the study, and after a 60-day wash out period, baseline measurements of lipoprotein parameters, LDL particle diameter, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) degradation fragments were obtained. The group was then randomized, in a double-blinded manner, into 2 subgroups. Group A received <tx1>atorvastatin (80 mg)</tx1> and group B received <tx2>placebo</tx2> daily for 60 days. After the first treatment period, all patients were reanalyzed for the above parameters. The treatment regime then crossed over for the second treatment period in which group A received <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> and group B received <tx1_a>atorvastatin (80 mg)</tx1_a> daily for 60 days. All parameters were remeasured at the end of the study. Treatment with <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> resulted in a statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol (41%), LDL cholesterol (55%), triglycerides (TG) (32%), and apoB (40%). Mean LDL particle diameter significantly increased from 25.29 +/- 0.24 nm (small, dense LDL subclass) to 26.51 < 0.18 nm (intermediate LDL subclass) after treatment with <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> (n = 20, P <.005). At baseline, LDL particles were predominantly found in the small, dense subclass; <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> treatment resulted in a shift in the profile to the larger and more buoyant LDL subclass. <tx1_a>Atorvastatin</tx1_a> treatment did not produce consistent changes in the appearance of apoB degradation fragments in plasma. Our results suggest that <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> beneficially alters the atherogenic lipid profile in these patients and significantly decreases the density of LDL particles produced resulting in a shift from small, dense LDL to more buoyant and less atherogenic particles.

Abstract 69 of 500

A double blind comparison is reported of a new tetracyclic antidepressant, maprotiline, with amitriptyline and placebo in psychiatric outpatients. Amitriptyline was significantly more effective than placebo in its global effect on depression. Maprotiline emerged as neither inferior to amitriptyline nor superior to placebo. Methodological difficulties prevented an adequate assessment of the anxiolytic activity of maprotiline.

Abstract 70 of 500

Prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in uremia necessitates correction of hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. In order to avoid aluminum toxicity, calcium containing phosphate binders are used increasingly, instead of <tx1_a>aluminium hydroxide</tx1_a>. Recent studies have shown that <tx2_a>calcium acetate</tx2_a> has many characteristics of an ideal phosphate binder. It is, for instance, a more readily soluble salt compared with calcium carbonate. This advantage might, however, disappear if calcium carbonate is taken on an empty stomach, a few minutes before meals. We examined the efficacy of three different phosphate binding agents in a randomized prospective study of <n>53</n> patients on regular hemodialysis. Bicarbonate dialyses were performed with a dialysate calcium concentration of 1.75 mmol/l. After a three-week wash-out period, patients received either <tx1>aluminum hydroxide</tx1> (control group), <tx2>calcium acetate</tx2>, or <tx3>calcium carbonate</tx3> as their phosphate binder. Patients were instructed to take the <tx2_a><tx3_a>calcium</tx2_a></tx3_a> salts a few minutes before meals on an empty stomach, and <tx1_a>aluminum hydroxide</tx1_a> during meals. Serum <tx3_a><tx2_a>calcium</tx2_a></tx3_a>, phosphate, intact parathormone, and alkaline phosphatase levels were determined every month. Patient compliance was estimated every month by asking the patients which phosphate binder and what daily dose they had used. <tx1_a>Aluminum hydroxide</tx1_a> tended to be the most effective phosphate binder. The mean +/- SEM required daily dose of <tx2_a><tx3_a>calcium</tx3_a> acetate</tx2_a> at 12 months was 5.04 +/- 0.60 g, corresponding to 10.1 +/- 1.20 tablets of 500 mg. Co-medication with <tx1_a>aluminum hydroxide</tx1_a>, however, was needed (1.29 +/- 0.54 g per day, corresponding to 2.6 +/- 1.08 tablets of 500 mg). The required daily <tx2_a><tx3_a>calcium</tx2_a></tx3_a> carbonate dose appeared to be 2.71 +/- 0.48 g, corresponding to 5.4 +/- 0.95 capsules of 500 mg, with an adjuvant daily <tx1_a>aluminum hydroxide</tx1_a> dose of 0.69 +/- 0.27 g, corresponding to 1.4 +/- 0.55 tablets of 500 mg (p = 0.0055). Thus, the mean daily doses of elemental <tx2_a><tx3_a>calcium</tx2_a></tx3_a> were comparable between the <tx2_a><tx3_a>calcium</tx3_a> acetate</tx2_a> and <tx3_a><tx2_a>calcium</tx2_a> carbonate</tx3_a>-treated patients (1.28 +/- 0.15 g versus 1.09 +/- 0.19 g; n.s.). The incidence of hypercalcemic episodes (albumin-corrected serum calcium levels above 2.80 mmol/l) in the <tx2_a><tx3_a>calcium</tx3_a> acetate</tx2_a>-treated group was 18% versus 31% in the <tx3_a><tx2_a>calcium</tx2_a> carbonate</tx3_a>-treated group (p < 0.005). None of the <tx3_a>aluminum hydroxide</tx3_a>-treated patients experienced hypercalcemic episodes. Mean serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, intact parathormone, and aluminum did not differ between the groups. In chronic intermittent hemodialysis patients, per gram administered elemental <tx2_a><tx3_a>calcium</tx2_a></tx3_a> phosphate binding with either <tx2_a><tx3_a>calcium</tx3_a> acetate</tx2_a> or <tx3_a><tx2_a>calcium</tx2_a> carbonate</tx3_a> is equivalent, provided that <tx3_a><tx2_a>calcium</tx2_a> carbonate</tx3_a> is taken on an empty stomach a few minutes before meals. The number of capsules <tx3_a><tx2_a>calcium</tx2_a> carbonate</tx3_a>, but also the total amount in grams, necessary to keep serum phosphate and intact parathormone levels into an acceptable range then is significantly less. This might improve patient compliance.

Abstract 71 of 500

To determine the efficacy of <tx2>azathioprine</tx2> in the treatment of Crohn's disease, a 26-week double-blind trial was performed. <n>20</n> patients with Crohn's disease, requiring at least 10 mg of prednisone/day over the 3 months prior to entering the study were randomized into <tx1>placebo</tx1> (<n1>10</n1> patients) and major criterion of success in the trial. There were 7 relapses in the <tx1_a>placebo</tx1_a> group (5 patients) and 2 relapses in the <tx2_a>azathioprine</tx2_a> group (2 patients). Complications including fistulae were not affected by the medications. The mean reduction in steriod dosage in the <tx2_a>azathioprine</tx2_a> group at the end of the trial (-15.5 mg) was greater than in the <tx1_a>placebo</tx1_a> group (-6.1 mg). These results suggest that <tx1_a>azathioprine</tx1_a> may permit reduction or discontinuation of steroids without the worsening of symptoms in some patients who appear to require steroids for control of their symptoms. The clinical features of this "AZA-responsive subgroup" remain to be defined.

Abstract 72 of 500

Menopausal hormone therapy has long been credited with many benefits beyond the indications of relieving hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness, and it is often prescribed to treat urinary incontinence (UI). To assess the effects of menopausal hormone therapy on the incidence and severity of symptoms of stress, urge, and mixed UI in healthy postmenopausal women. Women's Health Initiative multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of menopausal hormone therapy in 27,347 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years enrolled between 1993 and 1998, for whom UI symptoms were known in 23,296 participants at baseline and 1 year. Women were randomized based on hysterectomy status to active treatment or placebo in either the estrogen plus progestin (E + P) or estrogen alone trials. The E + P hormones were 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE + MPA); estrogen alone consisted of 0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE). There were 8506 participants who received CEE + MPA (8102 who received placebo) and 5310 who received CEE alone (5429 who received placebo). Incident UI at 1 year among women without UI at baseline and severity of UI at 1 year among women who had UI at baseline. Menopausal hormone therapy increased the incidence of all types of UI at 1 year among women who were continent at baseline. The risk was highest for stress UI (CEE + MPA: relative risk [RR], 1.87 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.61-2.18]; CEE alone: RR, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.77-2.62]), followed by mixed UI (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.10-2.01]; CEE alone: RR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.26-2.53]). The combination of CEE + MPA had no significant effect on developing urge UI (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99-1.34), but CEE alone increased the risk (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58). Among women experiencing UI at baseline, frequency worsened in both trials (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.28-1.49]; CEE alone: RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.35-1.61]). Amount of UI worsened at 1 year in both trials (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.06-1.36]; CEE alone: RR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.39-1.82]). Women receiving menopausal hormone therapy were more likely to report that UI limited their daily activities (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.06-1.32]; CEE alone: RR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.15-1.45]) and bothered or disturbed them (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.13-1.32]; CEE alone: RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.37-1.65]) at 1 year. Conjugated equine estrogen alone and CEE + MPA increased the risk of UI among continent women and worsened the characteristics of UI among symptomatic women after 1 year. Conjugated equine estrogen with or without progestin should not be prescribed for the prevention or relief of UI.

Abstract 73 of 500

The efficacy and safety of <tx1>minocycline</tx1> were compared with that of <tx2>amoxicillin</tx2> in the treatment of <n>58</n> patients with acute bacterial sinusitis. The most frequently isolated pathogens were streptococci, staphylococci, and Haemophilus influenzae. After therapy for a mean time of 11 days, clinical cure or improvement and bacterial eradication were evident in 100% of the patients treated with <tx1_a>minocycline</tx1_a> and in 95% of the patients treated with <tx2_a>amoxicillin</tx2_a>. Roentgenographic results indicated clearing or improvement in 91% of the <tx1_a>minocycline</tx1_a> recipients and in 70% of those who received <tx2_a>amoxicillin</tx2_a>. These differences between treatments were not statistically significant. A low incidence of generally mild adverse clinical experiences occurred in both treatment groups. Thus, <tx1_a>minocycline</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>amoxicillin</tx2_a> were equally safe and effective in the treatment of these patients with acute bacterial sinusitis.

Abstract 74 of 500

To assess the safety and efficacy of <tx1_a>37.5 mg ephedrine</tx1_a> i.m. in preventing hypotension associated with spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section. In a double-blind randomised controlled study, <n>40</n> patients (<n1><n2>20</n1></n2> in each group) were given either <tx1>37.5 mg ephedrine</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2> i.m. The following parameters were recorded: (i) blood pressure; (ii) heart rate; (iii) ephedrine i.v. supplementation; (iv) umbilical venous blood gases and neonatal Apgar scores. The incidence of hypertension in the study group was 30% compared with 20% for the control group (P:NS). There was no difference in mean highest blood pressure or mean highest heart rate between the groups. The incidence of hypotension was lower but not significantly lower in the study group (50%) than in the control group (80%) (P:NS). However, the incidence of delayed hypotension was only 10% in the study group patients compared with 50% in the control group patients (P < 0.05). Giving <tx1_a>37.5 mg ephedrine</tx1_a> i.m. prior to spinal anaesthesia was not associated with reactive hypertension or tachycardia. Intramuscular ephedrine provided more sustained cardiovascular support than intravenous ephedrine.

Abstract 75 of 500

To compare the analgesic efficacy of single and multiple doses of ibuprofen with that of paracetamol in patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis (IPSO study). 222 patients were randomised in a double blind, multicentre study-156 (70%) had a painful knee joint and 66 (30%) a painful hip joint. The main efficacy criterion was pain intensity assessment after a single dose (ibuprofen 400 mg, paracetamol 1000 mg). Functional disability assessment and patient global assessment were carried out over 14 days. The sum of the pain intensity difference over 6 hours after the first administration was significantly higher (p = 0.046) in the ibuprofen group than in the paracetamol group. Over 14 days pain intensity decreased from the first day and was significantly lower in the ibuprofen group than in the paracetamol group (p<0.05). The functional disability of the patient was assessed using the WOMAC; the ibuprofen group improved significantly over 2 weeks compared with the paracetamol group for each of the subscales: stiffness (p<0.002), pain (p<0.001), physical function (p<0.002). The drugs were equally safe. The IPSO study shows that for the treatment of osteoarthritic pain, ibuprofen 400 mg at a single and multiple dose (1200 mg/day) for 14 days is more effective than paracetamol, either as a single dose of 1000 mg or a multiple dose (3000 mg/day). Because ibuprofen and paracetamol have similar tolerability, this study indicates that the efficacy/tolerability ratio of ibuprofen is better than that of paracetamol in this indication over 14 days.

To evaluate whether 360 ml of oral clear liquids consumed within 4 hours of elective surgery worsens gastric volume and acidity in patients given acid aspiration prophylaxis. Randomized, unblinded study. Main operating room at a U.S. military hospital. <n>Eighty-three</n> adult inpatients scheduled to receive general anesthesia for elective surgery. <n1>Nineteen</n1> patients (Group 1) were given <tx1>150 mg of oral ranitidine (two doses), 10 mg of metoclopramide, and 360 ml of apple juice</tx1> 3 hours before the scheduled start of surgery. <n2>Thirty-four</n2> patients (Group 2) <tx2>fasted before surgery but received acid aspiration prophylaxis</tx2> identical to that given to Group 1. <n3>Twenty-three</n3> additional patients (Group 3) received <tx3>no oral fluids or acid aspiration prophylaxis before surgery</tx3>. The residual gastric volume (RGV) and the pH of Group 1 patients were compared with measurements obtained in the two groups of patients who <tx2_a><tx3_a>fasted</tx2_a></tx3_a>. RGV measurements in Group 1 (14 +/- 3 ml) were similar to those in Group 2 (11 +/- 2 ml) and were significantly less than (p less than 0.05) those in Group 3 (26 +/- 4 ml). Gastric pH was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in Group 1 (5.16 +/- 0.69) and Group 2 (5.78 +/- 0.43) than in Group 3 (1.97 +/- 0.27). <tx1_a>Three hundred and sixty ml of apple juice consumed within 4 hours of elective surgery by patients given ranitidine and metoclopramide</tx1_a> did not worsen gastric volume and acidity.

Abstract 78 of 500

The Swedish Ticlopidine Multicentre Study (STIMS) was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial designed to determine whether ticlopidine, a platelet antiaggregatory agent, reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke and transitory ischaemic attacks in patients with intermittent claudication. A total of 687 patients was monitored for a minimum of 5 years or until an end-point was reached. The number of end points (99 vs. 89), analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle, was 11.4% lower in the ticlopidine group (P = 0.24). The mortality rate was 29.1% lower in the ticlopidine group (64 vs. 89, P = 0.015); this observation could be accounted for by a reduced mortality from ischaemic heart disease. On-treatment analysis showed there to be significantly fewer end points in the ticlopidine group (47 vs. 76, P = 0.017). Diarrhoea was the most common side-effect. Reversible leucopenia or thrombocytopenia was reported in seven patients on ticlopidine. It is concluded that the high morbidity and mortality from cardio- and cerebrovascular disease in patients with intermittent claudication can be reduced by long-term treatment with ticlopidine.

Abstract 79 of 500

The expected 4-week cure rate after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis are only 65-70%. In an attempt to improve the cure rate by adding <tx1_a>probiotic lactobacilli</tx1_a> we performed a double-blind <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled study of <tx1>adjuvant lactobacilli treatment</tx1> after an open treatment with vaginal clindamycin ovules. Women with bacterial vaginosis as defined by Amsel's criteria were treated with clindamycin ovules. Vaginal smears were collected and analysed according to Nugent's criteria. During the following menstruation period the women used, as an adjuvant treatment, either <tx1_a>lactobacilli-prepared tampons</tx1_a> or <tx2>placebo tampons</tx2>. The <tx1_a>lactobacilli tampons</tx1_a> were loaded with a mixture of freeze-dried L. fermentum, L. casei var. rhamnosus and L. gasseri. The cure rate was recorded after the second menstruation period. There was no improvement in the cure rate after treatment with <tx1_a>lactobacilli-containing tampons</tx1_a> compared to <tx2_a>placebo tampons</tx2_a>; the cure rates as defined by Amsel's criteria were 56% and 62%, respectively, and 55% and 63%, as defined by Nugent's criteria. This is the first study to report cure rates for women with 'intermediate' wet smear ratings according to Nugent's classification and this group had an overall cure rate of 44%. The cure rate of treatment of bacterial vaginosis was not improved by using <tx1_a>lactobacilli-prepared tampons</tx1_a> for one menstruation.

Abstract 80 of 500

To investigate the effects of adjunctive therapy with parenteral <tx1_a>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</tx1_a> in patients with newly diagnosed septic shock. Prospective, randomized, double-blind, <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled study. Multidisciplinary intensive care unit at a university teaching hospital. <n>Twenty</n> patients (<tx1_a>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</tx1_a> group [n = <n1>10</n1>], <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group [n = <n2>10</n2>]), 15 male and five female, of mean age 64 +/- 15 (SD) yrs and Acute Physiology and Chronic health Evaluation (APACHE) II score 33 +/- 6, with septic shock within 24 hrs of diagnosis. After a 2-hr stabilization period (time-zero minus 2 hrs to time-zero), patients received either <tx1>N-acetyl-L-cysteine in 5% dextrose (150 mg/kg in 100 mL over 15 mins, followed by 50 mg/kg in 250 mL over 4 hrs, and then 100 mg/kg/24 hrs in 500 mL for 44 hrs</tx1>; N-acetyl-L-cysteine group) or the <tx2>equivalent volume of 5% dextrose (placebo</tx2> group). Hemodynamic and oxygen transport indices were measured at time-zero minus 2 hrs and time-zero, and at multiple time points thereafter until completion of the trial infusion (time-zero plus 48 hrs). A daily Organ Failure Score was recorded for 14 days. Treatment group demographics and hemodynamic variables did not differ significantly between the two groups at time-zero. Mean (SD), pooled mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cardiac index were 75 +/- 15 mm Hg and 3.9 +/- 1.2 L/min/m2, respectively. Over the next 48 hrs, in the <tx1_a>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</tx1_a> group, there was a progressive decrease, relative to both time-zero and the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group, in MAP, cardiac index, and left ventricular stroke work index (p < .01, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Percentage reductions in these values relative to the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group at 48 hrs were 23%, 18%, and 43%, respectively Oxygen transport indices, arterial blood gas analyses, Pao2/Fio2 ratio, and shunt did not differ over time between the groups. There was no difference in either daily Organ Failure Score over time (p > .01, repeated-measures analysis of variance) or hospital mortality rate (90% <tx1_a>N-acetyl-L-cysteine group</tx1_a>, 50% <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group) (p > .1, logistic regression) between the two groups. Adjunctive therapy with <tx1_a>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</tx1_a> in newly diagnosed septic shock was associated with a depression in cardiovascular performance, as indicated by progressive reductions in cardiac index, left ventricular stroke work index, and MAP.

Abstract 81 of 500

In order to investigate the possible stimulating effect of danazol on fertility, a randomized clinical trial was performed on 40 women with unexplained infertility. Of these 40 women, 21 received 200 mg of danazol daily for 100 days and 19 received a placebo treatment during the same period. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, estrone, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were followed before, during, and after treatment. Danazol administration induced anovulation in all women, with prompt resumption of normal ovulatory function after discontinuation of the drug. No influence was seen on serum LH, FSH, and testosterone levels, but serum estrone, estradiol, and progesterone levels decreased significantly during treatment. Serum prolactin levels also decreased, but not significantly. No pregnancies occurred in the placebo group during a 6-month follow-up period. In the danazol group, five pregnancies occurred, of which two were ectopic and three went to term. The difference in pregnancy rate between both groups was statistically significant (P less than 0.05).

Abstract 82 of 500

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of <tx1_a>escitalopram</tx1_a> in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD, fall-winter depression). <n>Twenty</n> SAD patients were included in an 8-week drug surveillance. Patients were treated with open-label <tx1>escitalopram at a dosage of 10 to 20 mg per day</tx1>. Efficacy assessments included the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SAD version; SIGH-SAD), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Social Adaptation Self Evaluation Scale (SASS). Side effects were monitored with the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale. From week 2 onwards, <tx1_a>escitalopram</tx1_a> significantly reduced SIGH-SAD score and CGI severity score (p<0.001). From week 4 onwards, the SASS score was also significantly improved (p<0.05). The response rate (SIGH-SAD<50% of baseline value) after treatment for 8 weeks was 95%, the rate of remission (SIGH-SAD < or =7) was 85%. Side effects were mild to moderate and did not lead to cessation of therapy. These results suggest that <tx1_a>escitalopram</tx1_a>s is an efficacious and altogether safe treatment for seasonal depression.

Abstract 83 of 500

<tx1_a><tx3_a>Etanercept</tx1_a></tx3_a> and <tx2_a><tx3_a>methotrexate</tx2_a></tx3_a> are effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but no data exist on concurrent initiation or use of the combination compared with either drug alone. We aimed to assess combination treatment with <tx3><tx1_a>etanercept</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>methotrexate</tx2_a></tx3> versus the monotherapies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In a double-blind, randomised, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic study, <n>686</n> patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly allocated to treatment with <tx1>etanercept 25 mg (subcutaneously twice a week)</tx1>, <tx2>oral methotrexate (up to 20 mg every week)</tx2>, or <tx3_a>the combination</tx3_a>. Clinical response was assessed by criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). The primary efficacy endpoint was the numeric index of the ACR response (ACR-N) area under the curve (AUC) over the first 24 weeks. The primary radiographic endpoint was change from baseline to week 52 in total joint damage and was assessed with the modified Sharp score. Analysis was by intention to treat. Four patients did not receive any drug; thus 682 were studied. ACR-N AUC at 24 weeks was greater for the <tx3_a>combination</tx3_a> group compared with <tx1_a><tx3_a>etanercept</tx1_a></tx3_a> alone and <tx2_a><tx3_a>methotrexate</tx2_a></tx3_a> alone (18.3%-years [95% CI 17.1-19.6] vs 14.7%-years [13.5-16.0], p<0.0001, and 12.2%-years [11.0-13.4], p<0.0001; respectively). The mean difference in ACR-N AUC between <tx3_a>combination</tx3_a> and <tx2_a><tx3_a>methotrexate</tx2_a></tx3_a> alone was 6.1 (95% CI 4.5-7.8, p<0.0001) and between <tx1_a><tx3_a>etanercept</tx1_a></tx3_a> and <tx2_a><tx3_a>methotrexate</tx2_a></tx3_a> was 2.5 (0.8-4.2, p=0.0034). The <tx3_a>combination</tx3_a> was more efficacious than <tx2_a><tx3_a>methotrexate</tx2_a></tx3_a> or <tx1_a><tx3_a>etanercept</tx1_a></tx3_a> alone in retardation of joint damage (mean total Sharp score -0.54 [95% CI -1.00 to -0.07] vs 2.80 [1.08 to 4.51], p<0.0001, and 0.52 [-0.10 to 1.15], p=0.0006; respectively). The mean difference in total Sharp score between <tx3_a>combination</tx3_a> and <tx2_a><tx3_a>methotrexate</tx2_a></tx3_a> alone was -3.34 (95% CI -4.86 to -1.81, p<0.0001) and between <tx1_a><tx3_a>etanercept</tx1_a></tx3_a> and <tx2_a><tx3_a>methotrexate</tx2_a></tx3_a> was -27 (-3.81 to -0.74, p=0.0469). The number of patients reporting infections or adverse events was similar in all groups. The combination of <tx1_a><tx3_a>etanercept</tx1_a></tx3_a> and <tx2_a><tx3_a>methotrexate</tx2_a></tx3_a> was significantly better in reduction of disease activity, improvement of functional disability, and retardation of radiographic progression compared with <tx2_a><tx3_a>methotrexate</tx3_a></tx2_a> or <tx1_a><tx3_a>etanercept</tx1_a></tx3_a> alone. These findings bring us closer to achievement of remission and repair of structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis.

Abstract 84 of 500

Eighty-eight outpatients with postoperative pain after the surgical removal of impacted third molars were randomly assigned, on a double-blind basis, to receive a single, oral dose of flurbiprofen 100 mg, acetaminophen 600 mg, a combination of acetaminophen 600 mg with codeine 60 mg, or placebo. Using a self-rating record, subjects rated their pain and its relief hourly for 12 hours after medicating. Estimates of sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity differences, total relief, peak relief, and hours of 50% relief were derived from these subjective reports. Flurbiprofen and the acetaminophen-codeine combination were significantly superior to placebo for every measure of total and peak analgesia and significantly superior to acetaminophen alone for most measures of efficacy. Based on the 12-hour data, acetaminophen alone did not differ significantly from placebo; however, it was superior to placebo for measures of total effect based on the 4-hour data. Flurbiprofen was significantly superior to the acetaminophen codeine combination with respect to the number of hours until remedication. All medications had manifested an effect by hour 1; analgesia persisted for 12 hours for flurbiprofen, 6 hours for acetaminophen-codeine, and 3 hours for acetaminophen alone. The frequency of adverse effects was similar for the active medications.

Abstract 85 of 500

After total hip (THR) or knee replacement (TKR), there is still an appreciable risk of developing deep-vein thrombosis despite prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). In a prospective, randomised study we examined the efficacy of <tx1_a><tx>LMWH</tx> in combination with intermittent pneumatic compression</tx1_a> in patients undergoing primary unilateral THR or TKR. We administered <tx>40 mg of enoxaparin daily</tx> to <n>131</n> patients combined with either the use of <tx1>intermittent pneumatic compression</tx1> or the <tx2>wearing of graduated compression stockings</tx2>. Compression ultrasonography showed no evidence of thrombosis after <tx2_a><tx_a>LMWH</tx_a> and intermittent pneumatic compression</tx2_a>. In the group with <tx2_a>LMWH and compression stockings</tx2_a> the prevalence of thrombosis was 28.6% (40% after TKR, 14% after THR). This difference was significant (p < 0.0001). In the early post-operative phase after THR and TKR, combined prophylaxis with <tx2_a><tx_a>LMWH</tx_a> and intermittent pneumatic compression</tx2_a> is more effective than <tx1_a><tx_a>LMWH</tx_a> used with graduated compression stockings</tx1_a>.

Abstract 86 of 500

Vitiligo is an acquired depigmenting disease with uncertain aetiopathogenesis, possibly associated with oxidative stress. <tx>Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy (NB-UVB)</tx> is the most widely used and effective treatment. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of <tx_a>NB-UVB</tx_a> and the repairing of oxidative stress-induced damage, using <tx1_a>oral supplementation with an antioxidant pool (AP)</tx1_a>. Patients (n = <n>35</n>) with nonsegmental vitiligo were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled multicentre trial. The treatment group received, <tx1>for 2 months before and for 6 months during the <tx_a>NB-UVB</tx_a> treatment, a balanced AP containing alpha-lipoic acid, vitamins C and E, and polyunsaturated fatty acids</tx1>. The area and number of lesions, as well as some parameters of the oxidation-reduction (redox) status of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were estimated at the beginning, after 2 months, and at the end of the trial. In total, 28 patients completed the study. After 2 months of <tx1_a>AP supplementation</tx1_a>, the catalase activity and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were 121% and 57% of the basal values (P < 0.05 and P < 0.02 vs. <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>, respectively). The <tx1_a>AP</tx1_a> increased the therapeutic success of <tx_a>NB-UVB</tx_a>, with 47% of the patients obtaining > 75% repigmentation vs. 18% in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group (P < 0.05). An increase in catalase activity to 114% (P < 0.05 vs. <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>) and decrease in ROS level of up to 60% (P < 0.02 vs. <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>) of the basal value was observed in PBMCs. Finally, the <tx1_a>AP</tx1_a> intake maintained the membrane lipid ratio (saturated : unsaturated fatty acids 1.8 : 3.1; P < 0.05), counteracting phototherapy-induced saturation. Oral supplementation with <tx1_a>AP</tx1_a> containing alpha-lipoic acid before and during <tx_a>NB-UVB</tx_a> significantly improves the clinical effectiveness of <tx_a>NB-UVB</tx_a>, reducing vitiligo-associated oxidative stress.

Notes: I read this as; both groups got NB-UVB but oral supplements were given only to arm 1 (arm 2 got placebo). Could be wrong though.

Abstract 88 of 500

A double blind <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled study of <tx1>two doses of gamma-linolenic acid, provided by evening primrose oil (EPO, Epogam, Searle, U.K.)</tx1>, in children with atopic dermatitis was performed: 1) to examine the effect of <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid</tx1_a> administration on the clinical status of children with atopic dermatitis and abnormalities of IgE-mediated immune responses compared to those without such IgE abnormalities; 2) to investigate the effect of <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid</tx1_a> on red cell fatty acid composition and 3) to assess whether treatment with <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid</tx1_a> induced changes in red cell membrane microviscosity. A significant improvement in the overall severity of the clinical condition was seen in children treated with <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid</tx1_a>, independent of whether the children had manifestations of IgE-mediated allergy. Furthermore, <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid</tx1_a> treatment increased the percentage content of n-6 fatty acids in erythrocyte cell membrane; this increase was more marked in the membranes of children treated with high doses of <tx1_a>EPO</tx1_a>. In the high dose group a significant increase in dihomogamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) occurred. This may be of particular relevance because of the potential importance of DGLA as a precursor of antiinflammatory prostanoids. Red cell membrane microviscosity did not change in any group after treatment with <tx1_a>EPO</tx1_a>, even in high doses, despite a significant increase in the proportion of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Abstract 89 of 500

Acute steroid-resistant rejection episodes are recommended to be treated with set doses of <tx1>anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)</tx1> or <tx2>anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3)</tx2>. Individualized T cell monitoring has been proposed as a tool for dose finding. A randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of <tx1_a>ATG</tx1_a> (n = <n1>27</n1>) with <tx2_a>OKT3</tx2_a> (n = <n2>28</n2>) in the treatment of biopsy verified acute steroid-resistant rejection (ASRR) when both drugs were administered on the basis of daily individualized T cell measurements. A drop to below 50 cells/mm3 CD2+ T cells was considered adequate and used to guide the dose of <tx1_a>ATG</tx1_a>/<tx2_a>OKT3</tx2_a>. Demographic, clinical and histopathological severities of rejections were equal in the two groups. During the 10 days of T cell monitoring and antibody treatment, 13 patients were in need of dialysis (<tx1_a>ATG</tx1_a> = 7/<tx2_a>OKT3</tx2_a> = 6). Two grafts did not respond to antibody treatment and were lost due to rejection (<tx1_a>ATG</tx1_a> = 1/<tx2_a>OKT3</tx2_a> = 1). There were 26 biopsy verified re-rejections (<tx1_a>ATG</tx1_a> = 12/<tx2_a>OKT3</tx2_a> = 14) within the first 3 months following antibody treatment. Mean serum creatinine (micromol/L) was similar in the two groups (<tx1_a>ATG</tx1_a>/<tx2_a>OKT3</tx2_a>: before rejection 157 +/- 72/151 +/- 88, at start of antibody treatment 308 +/- 125/330 +/- 94, end of antibody treatment 254 +/- 122/246 +/- 144 and at follow-up after a mean of 32 months 166 +/- 55 (n = 24)/164 +/- 57(n = 23)). To keep the T cell count below 50 cells/mm3, average dose <tx1_a>ATG</tx1_a> given was 354 +/- 151 mg (2.3 administrations, range 1-4) and average <tx2_a>OKT3</tx2_a> was 32.5 +/- 6.8 mg in 10 doses. In conclusion, individualized T cell monitored administration of <tx1_a>ATG</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>OKT3</tx2_a> is safe and seems as effective as a standard set dose in treatment of ASRR. Tailoring the dose for each individual patient lowers the cost.

Abstract 90 of 500

In a randomized, double-blinded study with three parallel groups, we assessed the analgesic effect of intraoperative ketamine administration in 45 ASA physical status I or II patients undergoing elective arthroscopic anterior ligament repair under general anesthesia. The patients received either IV ketamine 0.15 mg/kg after the induction of anesthesia and before surgical incision and normal saline at the end of surgery (PRE group); normal saline after the induction of anesthesia and before surgical incision and IV ketamine at the end of surgery (POST group); or normal saline at the beginning and the end of surgery (CONT group). Anesthesia was performed with propofol (2 mg/kg for induction, 60-200 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for maintenance), sufentanil (0.2 microg/kg 10 min after surgical incision, followed by an infusion of 0.25 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) stopped 30 min before skinclosure), vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg), and 60% N2O in O2 via a laryngeal mask airway. Postoperative analgesia was initially provided with IV morphine in the postanesthesia care unit, then with IV patient-controlled analgesia started before discharge from the postanesthesia care unit. Pain scores, morphine consumption, side effects, and degree of knee flexion were recorded over 48 h and during the first and second physiotherapy periods, performed on Days 1 and 2. Patients in the ketamine groups required significantly less morphine than those in the CONT group over 48 h postoperatively (CONT group 67.7+/-38.3 mg versus PRE group 34.3+/-23.2 mg and POST group 29.5+/-21.5 mg; P < 0.01). Better first knee flexion (CONT group 35+/-10 degrees versus PRE group 46+/-12 degrees and POST group 47+/-13 degrees; P < 0.05) and lower morphine consumption (CONT group 3.8+/-1.7 mg versus PRE group 1.2+/-0.4 mg and POST group 1.4+/-0.4 mg; P < 0.05) were noted at first knee mobilization. No differences were seen between the PRE and POST groups, except for an increase in morphine demand in the PRE versus the POST group (P < 0.05) in the second hour postoperatively. We found that intraoperative small-dose ketamine reduced postoperative morphine requirements and improved mobilization 24 h after arthroscopic anterior ligament repair. No differences were observed in the timing of administration. Intraoperative small-dose ketamine may therefore be a useful adjuvant to perioperative analgesic management.

Abstract 91 of 500

A controlled, double-blind investigation was undertaken to determine whether <tx1_a><tx2_a>regional anesthesia by dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB)</tx1_a></tx2_a> could effectively minimize the pain and behavioral disruptions usually associated with newborn circumcision. <n1>Fifteen</n1> infants had <tx1><tx2_a>DPNB</tx2_a> with lidocaine</tx1>, <n2>eight</n2> control infants had <tx2><tx1_a>DPNB</tx1_a> with saline</tx2>, and <n3>eight</n3> additional control infants were circumcised <tx3>without undergoing <tx1_a><tx2_a>DPNB</tx1_a></tx2_a></tx3>. Newborn distress was gauged by subjective observation, measurement of heart rate, and the percent of time spent crying in six sequential timed intervals during circumcision. Ninety-three percent of subjects who received <tx1_a>lidocaine</tx1_a> were observed to have a decrease in agitation after anesthetic administration. The mean increase in heart rate during circumcision was at least 50 percent less in the <tx1_a>lidocaine</tx1_a> injected group than in either control group (p less than 0.01). Infants who had <tx1_a><tx2_a>DPNB</tx2_a> with lidocaine</tx1_a> cried 50 percent less during circumcision compared to combined controls (p less than 0.01). <tx1_a><tx2_a>DPNB</tx1_a></tx2_a> was easily administered, and there were no significant complications. Physicians who circumcise newborns have good reason to employ the technique of <tx1_a><tx2_a>dorsal penile nerve block</tx2_a> with lidocaine</tx1_a> to minimize infant pain and distress.

In a prospective randomized and controlled double-blind trial the effect of <tx1>prophylactic systemic administration of Cefazolin</tx1> in elective colorectal surgery on postoperative wound infection was investigated. The incidence of wound infection was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) from 32% in the control group to 10% in the treated group. Furthermore there was a significant reduction (P less than 0.05) in hospital stay of about 3 days.

Abstract 93 of 500

To compare the efficacy of acupressure wrist bands and ondansetron for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). One hundred and fifty ASA I-II, patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in a randomized, prospective, double-blind and placebo-controlled study. Patients were divided into three groups of 50. Group I was the control; Group II received ondansetron 4 mg iv just prior to induction of anesthesia; in Group III acupressure wristbands were applied at the P6 points. Acupressure wrist bands were placed inappropriately in Groups I and II. The acupressure wrist bands were applied 30 min prior to induction of anesthesia and removed six hours following surgery. Anesthesia was standardized. PONV were evaluated separately as none, mild, moderate or severe within six hours of patients' arrival in the postanesthesia care unit and then at 24 hr after surgery by a blinded observer. If patients vomited more than once, they were given 4 mg ondansetron iv as the rescue antiemetic. Results were analyzed by Z test. A P value of < 0.05 was taken as significant. The incidence of PONV and the requirement of rescue medication were significantly lower in both the acupressure and ondansetron groups during the first six hours. Acupressure at P6 causes a significant reduction in the incidence of PONV and the requirement for rescue medication in the first six hours following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, similar to that of ondansetron 4 mg iv.

Abstract 94 of 500

The aim of this work was to compare the efficiency of <tx1>standard intrauterine insemination (IUI)</tx1> and <tx2>Fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP)</tx2> in the treatment of infertility. <n>Ninety-six</n> consecutive patients with infertility in 100 cycles were included in the study. Those randomized to standard <tx1_a>IUI</tx1_a> included <n1>48</n1> patients in 50 cycles [25 clomiphene citrate only and 25 clomiphene citrate/human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) cycles] (group I). Patients subjected to <tx2_a>FSP</tx2_a> included <n2>48</n2> patients in 50 cycles (18 clomiphene citrate only and 32 clomiphene citrate/HMG cycles) (group II). The overall pregnancy rate per cycle (16% versus 18%) was not significantly different in the two groups. The pregnancy rates were also similar in the two groups when compared for the cause of infertility: ovulatory disorder 16.7% versus 16%, tubal impairment 10% versus 9.1%, cervical hostility (no pregnancy occurred in this group) and unexplained infertility 21.4 % versus 25 %. The overall pregnancy rate (for the two groups) appeared higher when clomiphene citrate/HMG was used for ovulation induction (21.1%) than when clomiphene citrate only was used (11.6%).

Abstract 95 of 500

In this long-term study, we wanted to explore the effect of dietary supplementation of <tx1>seal oil (SO)</tx1> as compared <tx2>cod-liver oil (CLO)</tx2> on subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia. The test parameters included fatty acid composition in serum, blood lipids, platelet aggregation, and the activity of blood monocytes. After a run-in period of 6 mon, <n>120</n> clinically healthy hypercholesterolemic (7.0-9.5 mmol/L; 270-366 mg/dL) subjects were randomly selected to consume either 15 mL of <tx1_a>SO</tx1_a> or <tx2_a>CLO</tx2_a> daily for 14 mon followed by a 4-mon wash-out period. A third group was <tx3>not given any dietary supplement</tx3> (control). Consumption of marine oils (<tx1_a>SO</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>CLO</tx2_a>) changed the fatty acid composition of serum significantly. Maximal levels were achieved after 10 mon. No further changes were seen after 14 mon. A wash-out period of 4 mon hardly altered the level of n-3 fatty acids in serum. Addition of <tx1_a>SO</tx1_a> gave 30% higher level of eicosapentaenoic acid, as compared to <tx2_a>CLO</tx2_a>. Subjects taking <tx1_a>SO</tx1_a> or <tx2_a>CLO</tx2_a> had lower whole-blood platelet aggregation than the control group. Neither <tx1_a>SO</tx1_a> nor <tx2_a>CLO</tx2_a> had any effects on the levels of serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, postprandial triacylglycerol, apolipoproteins Al and B100, lipoprotein (a), monocyte function expressed as monocyte-derived tissue factor expression, and tumor necrosis factor.

Abstract 96 of 500

Because of its anti-androgenic activity spironolactone 50-200 mg daily is advocated widely for the management of female hirsutism but this practice lacks adequately controlled experimental support. In a double-blind placebo controlled study of the efficacy of spironolactone 100 mg daily in idiopathic hirsutism we were unable to demonstrate objective benefit from spironolactone treatment. The mean effect of spironolactone given over a 9 month period was to increase hair shaft diameter by +15% with 95% CI (-0.4% to +29%). In addition there were no changes in circulating serum androgen concentrations.

Abstract 97 of 500

Combination antimalarial therapy is advocated to improve treatment efficacy and limit selection of drug-resistant parasites. We compared the efficacies of 3 combination regimens in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso: <tx1>amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1>, which was recently shown to be highly efficacious at this site; <tx2>artemether-lumefantrine</tx2>, the new national first-line antimalarial regimen; and <tx3>dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)</tx3>, a newer regimen. We enrolled <n>559</n> patients >or=6 months of age with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and randomized them to the 3 regimens. We analyzed the risk of recurrent parasitemia by day 28 and day 42, both unadjusted and adjusted by PCR methods to distinguish recrudescence and new infection. Complete data were available for 517 (92.5%) of the enrolled subjects. Early treatment failures occurred in 5 patients treated with amodiaquine plus <tx1_a>sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1_a> and in 2 patients each treated with the other regimens. The day 28 risk of recurrent parasitemia, unadjusted by genotyping, was significantly higher for patients receiving artemether-lumefantrine than for patients receiving <tx1_a>amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1_a> (20.1% vs. 6.2%; risk difference, 13.8%; 95% confidence interval, 7.0%-20.7%) or <tx3_a>dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine</tx3_a> (20.1% vs. 2.2%; risk difference, 17.9%; 95% confidence interval, 11.6%-24.1%). Similar differences were seen for children <5 years of age (54% of the study population) and when outcomes were extended to 42 days. Significant differences were not seen between outcomes for patients receiving <tx1_a>amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1_a> and outcomes for those receiving <tx3_a>dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine</tx3_a>. Recrudescences were uncommon (occurring in <5% of patients) in all treatment groups. No serious adverse events were noted. All regimens were highly efficacious in clearing infection, but considering the risks of recurrent malaria after therapy, the <tx1_a>amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1_a> and <tx3_a>dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine</tx3_a> regimens were more efficacious than the <tx2_a>artemether-lumefantrine</tx2_a> regimen (the new national regimen in Burkina Faso) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.

Abstract 98 of 500

In order to evaluate the contribution of tubal spasm to pelvic pain following laparoscopic sterilisation, we have studied the effect of <tx1_a>glycopyrrolate</tx1_a>, an anticholinergic agent with antispasmodic properties, on 60 ASA 1 and 2 patients presenting as day-cases for laparoscopic sterilisation using Filshie clips. In a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial, patients received either <tx1>glycopyrrolate 0.3 mg</tx1> or <tx2>saline intravenously</tx2> prior to induction of anaesthesia. Compared with the control group, patients receiving <tx1_a>glycopyrrolate</tx1_a> had significantly reduced immediate postoperative pain scores (p < 0.02) and required significantly less postoperative morphine (p < 0.01). Nausea, vomiting and anti-emetic requirements were also reduced though not significantly. We conclude that <tx1_a>glycopyrrolate 0.3 mg</tx1_a> at induction of anaesthesia is an effective method of improving the quality of recovery after day-case laparoscopic sterilisation using clips.

Abstract 99 of 500

To test the hypothesis that statins improve hyperandrogenemia in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Prospective, randomized trial. Academic medical center. Forty-eight women with PCOS. Subjects were randomized to a statin group (simvastatin, 20 mg daily plus oral contraceptive pill [OCP]; n = 24) or an OCP group (OCP alone; n = 24). Serum T. Baseline parameters of both groups were comparable. After 12 weeks of treatment, serum T levels declined by 41% in the statin group and by 14% in the OCP group. In the statin group, there was a greater decrease of LH (43% decrease vs. 9% in the OCP group) and a greater decline of LH/FSH ratio (44% vs. 12%). In the statin group, total cholesterol declined by 10% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by 24%. In the OCP group, total cholesterol increased by 8%, and LDL was unchanged. This is the first study demonstrating that statin decreases T levels and normalizes gonadotropin levels in women with PCOS. Statin therapy might offer a novel approach, providing endocrine and cardiovascular benefits.

Abstract 100 of 500

Seven 24-hour ECG recordings and blood samples were taken within 3 weeks in <n>42</n> patients who had suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Ca, K and Mg concentrations in serum, and K and Mg in the erythrocytes, were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. One half of the patients were infused with <tx1>81 mval/day MgSO4 for 3 days</tx1>. In patients who exhibited intense electrolyte alterations 10-20 days after AMI, there was a significantly higher rate in the frequency of couplets and/or tachycardia in the 2- to 20-day period after AMI. In patients infused with <tx1_a>MgSO4</tx1_a>, the fluctuation in serum electrolytes and the rate of arrhythmias were significantly reduced.

Abstract 101 of 500

Melasma is a common disorder of cutaneous hyperpigmentation predominantly affecting the faces of women. Little is known about the aetiology of melasma, and treatment is frequently disappointing. Topical tretinoin is of benefit in treating other forms of hyperpigmentation, for example liver spots, and we therefore investigated its effectiveness in melasma. Thirty-eight women completed a randomized, vehicle-controlled study, in which they applied 0.1% tretinoin (n = 19) or vehicle cream (n = 19) once daily to the face for 40 weeks. At the end of treatment 13 (68%) of 19 tretinoin-treated patients were clinically rated as improved or much improved, compared with 1 (5%) of 19 in the vehicle group (P = 0.0006). Significant improvement first occurred after 24 weeks of tretinoin treatment. Colorimetry (an objective measure of skin colour) demonstrated a 0.9 unit lightening of tretinoin-treated melasma and a 0.3 unit darkening with vehicle (P = 0.01); these results correlated with clinical lightening (r = 0.55, P = 0.0005). Histologically, epidermal pigment was reduced 36% following tretinoin treatment, compared with a 50% increase with vehicle (P = 0.002). Reduction in epidermal pigment also correlated with clinical lightening (r = -0.41, P = 0.01). Moderate cutaneous side-effects of erythema and desquamation occurred in 88% of tretinoin-treated and 29% of vehicle-treated patients. Topical 0.1% tretinoin produces significant clinical improvement of melasma, mainly due to reduction in epidermal pigment, but improvement is slow.

Abstract 102 of 500

To establish the efficacy of immediate preoperative ototopical ofloxacin eardrops in eradicating middle ear pathogens and improving operative outcome. Single-blind, randomized control study. Tertiary referral center, ambulatory clinic, and hospital setting. Consecutive patients with chronic suppurative otitis media for Type I tympanoplasty (myringoplasty). The patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Group A underwent 10-minute daily treatments with eardrops for 2 weeks before surgery, Group B underwent 3-minute daily treatments for 2 weeks before surgery, and Group C underwent no treatment. Preoperative and perioperative bacteriology and success of the surgery as defined by an intact tympanic membrane in the eighth week postsurgery. There were 101 patients entered in the study. The preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative observation of discharge and quantity of the discharge were compared, and no differences were found among the groups (Kruskal-Wallis test). The perioperative culture results were analyzed and 18/21 (86%) became culture negative in Group A, 23/27 (85%) became culture negative in Group B, and 3/21 (14%) became culture negative in the control group (Group C versus Group A or Group B, chi(2) tests p < 0.001). The success rates of surgery as defined by an intact tympanic membrane showed no difference: 28/33 (85%), 27/33 (82%), and 31/35 (89%) in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The preoperative positive bacteriology rate in the surgical failures was 10/15 (67%), compared with 16/76 (21%) for the successful procedures (p < 0.001). Our study has shown that ofloxacin successfully eradicates most bacterial flora preoperatively. We cannot, however, confirm the benefits of its preoperative usage in improving the graft success rate.

Abstract 103 of 500

<n>91</n> renal transplant candidates were randomised to receive <tx1>Towne strain cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2> at least 8 weeks before transplantation. The <tx2_a>vaccine</tx2_a> was well tolerated and there was no <tx1_a>vaccine</tx1_a> virus excretion. Serological and cellular immune responses developed in most <tx1_a>vaccines</tx1_a> but were lower in the transplant patients than in healthy volunteers and some of the seronegative patients failed to mount responses. CMV infection occurred in most of the seronegative <tx1_a>vaccine</tx1_a>-treated or <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-treated patients who received kidneys from seropositive donors, but the illnesses were less severe in the <tx1_a>vaccines</tx1_a> than those in similarly exposed <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-treated patients. <tx1_a>Vaccine</tx1_a>-treated patients who received kidneys from seronegative donors did not excrete virus, and therefore the vaccine virus was not reactivated from a putative latent state despite immunosuppression at the time of transplantation.

Abstract 104 of 500

Few reports have addressed the value of <tx1_a>unfractionated heparin (UFH)</tx1_a> or low-molecular-weight heparin in treating the full spectrum of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), including recurrent VTE and pulmonary embolism. In an open, multicenter clinical trial, <n>720</n> consecutive patients with acute symptomatic VTE, including 119 noncritically ill patients (16.5%) with pulmonary embolism and 102 (14.2%) with recurrent VTE, were randomly assigned to treatment with <tx1>subcutaneous UFH with dose adjusted by activated partial thromboplastin time by means of a weight-based algorithm (preceded by an intravenous loading dose)</tx1>, or <tx2>fixed-dose (adjusted only to body weight) subcutaneous nadroparin calcium</tx2>. Oral anticoagulant therapy was started concomitantly and continued for at least 3 months. We recorded the incidence of major bleeding during the initial heparin treatment and that of recurrent VTE and death during 3 months of follow-up. Fifteen (4.2%) of the <n1>360</n1> patients assigned to <tx1_a>UFH</tx1_a> had recurrent thromboembolic events, as compared with 14 (3.9%) of the <n2>360</n2> patients assigned to <tx2_a>nadroparin</tx2_a> (absolute difference between rates, 0.3%; 95% confidence interval, -2.5% to 3.1%). Four patients assigned to <tx1_a>UFH</tx1_a> (1.1%) and 3 patients assigned to <tx2_a>nadroparin</tx2_a> (0.8%) had episodes of major bleeding (absolute difference between rates, 0.3%; 95% confidence interval, -1.2% to 1.7%). Overall mortality was 3.3% in each group. Subcutaneous <tx1_a>UFH</tx1_a> with dose adjusted by activated partial <tx1_a>thromboplastin time by means of a weight-based algorithm</tx1_a> is as effective and safe as fixed-dose <tx2_a>nadroparin</tx2_a> for the initial treatment of patients with VTE, including those with pulmonary embolism and recurrent VTE.

Abstract 105 of 500

A randomized comparative study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of amoxycillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) compared with mezlocillin for the prevention of wound infection in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. There was no difference in overall wound infection rates between the amoxycillin/clavulanate treated group and the mezlocillin group. When sub-groups were examined for total infections no significant difference was seen between antibiotic groups in patients undergoing clean/potentially contaminated operations or contaminated operations, although more deep infections were encountered in the amoxycillin/clavulanate group in comparison with the mezlocillin group, in contaminated operations. The type of operation performed also failed to show any difference in those patients undergoing upper gastro-intestinal, appendiceal, colonic, or biliary operations. The infections in those receiving amoxycillin/clavulanate were largely of bowel origin and predominantly sensitive to amoxycillin/clavulanate. Those in the mezlocillin group were predominantly staphylococcal in origin. Amoxycillin/clavulanate appears to be an effective antibiotic for use as a single agent in surgical prophylaxis.

Abstract 107 of 500

To determine the efficacy of <tx1>Auralgan otic solution</tx1> (combination product of antipyrine, benzocaine, and glycerin) compared with an <tx2>olive oil placebo</tx2> in the management of moderate to severe ear pain in children with acute otitis media (AOM). Children 5 years or older who presented with ear pain and eardrum findings indicative of AOM were randomly assigned to treatment with <tx1_a>Auralgan</tx1_a> or <tx2_a>olive oil</tx2_a> drops instilled into the external auditory canal(s) of the affected ear(s). All children were also treated with <tx>15 mg/kg of acetaminophen</tx> in a single dose. Ear pain was assessed by means of 2 visual analog seales-a linear scale and a color scale-at study entry and 10, 20, and 30 minutes later (T0, T10, T20, and T30, respectively). Results of the measurements on the 2 scales were evaluated independently and were averaged to determine an ear pain score. A baseline ear pain score of at least 3 points was required for study entry. Four outcome measures regarding ear pain score at T10, T20, and T30 were used: (1) proportion of subjects who showed 50% reduction, (2) proportion of subjects who showed 25% reduction, (3) proportion of subjects who showed a 1 or more point reduction, and (4) mean score over time. Primary care center and emergency department of a children's hospital. Fifty-four children aged 5 to 19 years with ear pain and AOM. The <tx1_a>Auralgan</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> groups were comparable regarding age, sex, race, laterality of AOM, and T0 ear pain score. By each of the 4 measures used, the response to treatment consistently favored the <tx1_a>Auralgan</tx1_a> group, but only at T30 were any differences statistically significant. In children with AOM-associated ear pain who are treated with acetaminophen, topically applied <tx1_a>Auralgan</tx1_a> appears likely to provide additional relief in varying degree within 30 minutes.

Abstract 108 of 500

To investigate whether continuous epidural droperidol and intravenous (IV) intraoperative droperidol inhibit pruritus and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) during epidural morphine analgesia. Randomized, double-blinded, controlled study. Metropolitan cancer center. 120 ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing thoracic or abdominal surgery with general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia. Patients received an intraoperative epidural injection of 2 mg morphine hydrochloride, followed postoperatively by a continuous epidural infusion of morphine hydrochloride 4 mg/day for 4 days. Patients were randomly allocated to four groups: Group A = control group, Group B = intraoperative single IV injection of droperidol (2.5 mg), Group C = postoperative continuous epidural droperidol infusion (2.5 mg/day), and Group D = intraoperative IV injection of droperidol (2.5 mg) and postoperative continuous epidural droperidol infusion (2.5 mg/day). The frequency and severity of pruritus and PONV in each group were evaluated during the postoperative period. Continuous epidural infusion of droperidol significantly reduced the frequency and severity of pruritus and PONV induced by epidural morphine without causing significant side effects. Intraoperative single IV injection of droperidol was effective for PONV (p < 0.05) but not for pruritus. Postoperative epidural droperidol infusion significantly decreased both the frequency and severity of pruritus and PONV during postoperative continuous epidural morphine analgesia. IV intraoperative droperidol significantly reduced the frequency and the severity of PONV but not pruritus.

Abstract 109 of 500

The cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation was investigated in lightly anaesthetised patients admitted to hospital for elective intracranial surgery. One group of patients was <tx1>given fentanyl 5 microgram/kg body weight</tx1> before induction with thiopentone and suxamethonium. The other group served as controls. <tx1_a>Fentanyl treatment</tx1_a> caused a significant attenuation of the blood pressure and pulse response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Different techniques for induction of anaesthesia are discussed in relation to the demands of neuroanaesthesia.

Abstract 110 of 500

Blood haemoglobin concentrations and reticulocyte counts were determined in <n>430</n> school children in grades 1, 3 and 5 in a small township in rural Zambia at the end of the rainy season. Running capacity was estimated by the 12-min running test. Age, sex, height, weight, social and nutritional indicators were recorded. Mean haemoglobin was 125.3 g/1 +/- 12.3 SD. Low haemoglobin was associated with indicators of a traditional way of life. After a controlled trial of <tx1>iron</tx1>, <tx2>folic acid</tx2>, <tx3>tetrachlorethylene</tx3> and <tx4>chloroquine</tx4> lasting for 6 weeks, mean haemoglobin in all the children was 128.8 g/1 +/- 10.0 SD. The mean haemoglobin was significantly higher in the <n1>218</n1> children who received iron than in the <n2>212</n2> children who did not receive iron. There were no other significant differences among the treatment groups. In a subgroup of 377 children who completed two running tests, those with lower haemoglobin ran significantly shorter distances, even when possible confounding factors were partialled out. The effect was reduced by excluding 12 children with haemoglobin less than 100 g/1 or 48 children with reticulocyte counts of 15% or more, but remained statistically significant.

Abstract 111 of 500

To compare the efficacy of gentamicin for 5 days plus doxycycline for 8 weeks with streptomycin for 2 weeks plus doxycycline for 45 days in the treatment of human brucellosis. In each arm of the study, 82 patients older than 10 years randomly received 5 mg/kg gentamicin once daily for 5 days plus 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily for 8 weeks or 1 g of streptomycin intramuscularly for 2 weeks plus the same dose of doxycycline for 45 days. Therapeutic failure and relapse in these two treatment groups were compared. This study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (www.irct.ir) with registration number ID: IRCT138708191441N1. The clinical manifestations in these two groups were similar. Therapeutic failure was seen in two (2.4%) patients in the gentamicin/doxycycline group and in four (4.9%) patients in the streptomycin/doxycycline group [relative risk (RR) = 0.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-2.66, P = 0.68]. Relapse was seen in two (2.4%) cases in the gentamicin/doxycycline group and in five (6.1%) cases in the streptomycin/doxycycline group (RR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.08-2, P = 0.44). The efficacy with the gentamicin/doxycycline regimen was 95.12% and that with the streptomycin/doxycycline regimen was 89% (RR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.98-1.17, P = 0.25). Cox regression analyses showed no differences among the two treatment groups for patients who had relapse or therapeutic failure and those who had not regarding baseline covariates such as sex, duration of disease before diagnosis, positive blood culture and focal disease. The results show that the efficacy of gentamicin for 5 days plus doxycycline for 8 weeks is not superior to that of streptomycin for 2 weeks plus doxycycline for 45 days.

Abstract 112 of 500

The effect of weekly iron supplementation with and without deworming on hemoglobin was investigated in a double-masked, placebo-controlled field trial. Subjects were <n>289</n> preschoolers who were randomly divided into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 received <tx1_a><tx2>30 mg Fe once weekly</tx1_a></tx2> and group 3 received a <tx3>placebo</tx3>. Group 1 additionally received <tx1>anthelminthic treatment</tx1>. Supplements were administered by the mothers, who were educated about iron deficiency beforehand. In the <tx1_a><tx2_a>iron-supplemented</tx1_a></tx2_a> groups prevalence of anemia decreased from 37.2% to 16.2% (P < 0.001). Hemoglobin increased by an average of 6.9 +/- 9.8 g/L in the two <tx1_a><tx2_a>iron-supplemented</tx1_a></tx2_a> groups (n = 191), which was greater (P < 0.001) than the increase of 1.9 +/- 8.0 g/L in the <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a> group. None of the subjects had hookworm, and anthelminthic treatment did not have an additional effect. Iron supplements administered once weekly by mothers reduced anemia without major involvement of health staff.

Abstract 113 of 500

To determine whether management of incomplete first-trimester abortion with vaginal <tx1_a>misoprostol</tx1_a> in an under-resourced setting is a viable treatment option. A total of <n>94</n> women were randomized to <tx1>600 microg of misoprostol intravaginally</tx1> or to <tx2>surgical curettage</tx2>. The women receiving <tx1_a>misoprostol</tx1_a> were administered a second dose if the abortion was incomplete; and if still not complete after a week, evacuation of retained products of conception was performed. All women had a follow-up visit 2 weeks following complete abortion. The overall success rate of medical management was 91.5%, with 15 of 47 successful cases after 1 dose of <tx1_a>misoprostol</tx1_a>; 8.5% of the 47 women required evacuation of retained products of conception after 1 week because of treatment failure. The success rate in the <tx2_a>surgical</tx2_a> arm was 100%. Patients in the medical arm had a longer duration of bleeding and a greater need for analgesia. There were no differences in hemoglobin levels, white blood cell count, adverse effects, pain score, and satisfaction with treatment at the follow-up visit. However, more women who received the medical treatment would recommend it or choose it in the future. Medical management using <tx1_a>600 microg of misoprostol</tx1_a> in 2 doses is effective to treat incomplete first-trimester abortions in an under-resourced setting when there is no evidence of uterine sepsis.

Abstract 114 of 500

To determine the preventive and therapeutic effect of 10 mg of propofol administered after delivery on the incidence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV) during intradural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Controlled, randomized double blind study of 60 women (ASA I-II) receiving intradural anesthesia for elective or deferred emergency cesarean delivery. The propofol group received 10 mg i.v. immediately after fetal extraction. The control group received an equal volume of Intralipid. The presence of IONV after administration of the prophylactic bolus was treated with a second bolus, and if nausea had not subsided completely after two minutes, treatment was topped up with dehydro-benzoperidol. The control group included 31 women and the propofol group 29, of whom 3 were excluded. Control variables were similar in the two groups. There were no significant differences in the incidence and severity of IONV between the two groups (22.5 versus 23%). The top-up antiemetic drug was used in the same number of patients in each group. Although 10 mg propofol has been described as an effective direct antiemetic, episodes of IONV were neither prevented nor reversed by its use during intradural anesthesia for cesarean delivery.

Abstract 115 of 500

The present study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of <tx1_a>clozapine</tx1_a> versus <tx2_a>"high-dose" olanzapine</tx2_a> in treatment-refractory adolescents with schizophrenia. Children, ages 10-18 years, who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and who were resistant or intolerant to at least two antipsychotic drugs were randomized to receive <tx1>12 weeks of double-blind flexibly dosed treatment with clozapine</tx1> (n = <n1>18</n1>) or <tx2>"high-dose" olanzapine (up to 30 mg/day)</tx2> (n = <n2>21</n2>). The primary efficacy measure was response (improvement), defined as a decrease of 30% or more in total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score from baseline and a Clinical Global Impression Scale improvement rating of "1" (very much improved) or "2" (much improved). Significantly more <tx1_a>clozapine</tx1_a>-treated adolescents met response criteria (66%) compared with <tx2_a>olanzapine</tx2_a>-treated subjects (33%). <tx1_a>Clozapine</tx1_a> was superior to <tx2_a>olanzapine</tx2_a> in terms of reduction of the psychosis cluster scores and negative symptoms from baseline to end point. However, both treatments were associated with significant weight-gain and related metabolic abnormalities. This double-blind randomized comparison of two second-generation antipsychotic drugs for treatment-refractory adolescents with schizophrenia supports <tx1_a>clozapine</tx1_a> as the agent of choice. The development of interventions to limit weight gain and metabolic side effects are needed to enhance the risk-benefit profile for both study treatments.

Abstract 116 of 500

We have studied the efficacy of topical <tx1_a>Mupirocin</tx1_a> for elimination of Staphylococcus aureus (Staph. aureus) nasal carriage in CAPD patients. Staph. aureus nasal carriers in our CAPD program were randomized to one of two groups: Group 1, treated with <tx1>Mupirocin</tx1>, and Group 2, treated with <tx2>neomycin sulphate nasal ointment</tx2>. The prevalence of Staph. aureus nasal colonization was 44% for patients (24/54) and 17% for dialysis partners (5/29). Group 1 included <n1>11</n1> patients and 1 partner, and Group 2, <n2>8</n2> patients and 2 partners. In Group 1, the eradication rate was 100%, and the recolonization rate was 0, 8, 41, 55 and 66% at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 10 months. In Group 2, the eradication rate was 40%, with a recolonization rate of 0.25 and 75% at 1, 2 and 3 months. Re-treatment with <tx1_a>mupirocin</tx1_a> was successful in 66% of the cases, compared to 20% for <tx2_a>neomycin</tx2_a>. The MIC90 of <tx1_a>mupirocin</tx1_a> for Staph. aureus was 0.5 mcg/mL, with an increase to 4 mcg/mL towards the end of the study. During the study period, there was a very low incidence of Staph. aureus peritonitis or catheter-related infections in patients treated with <tx1_a>mupirocin</tx1_a>. Secondary effects of <tx1_a>mupirocin</tx1_a> were negligible. <tx1_a>Mupirocin</tx1_a> is more effective than <tx2_a>neomycin sulphate</tx2_a> for the elimination of Staph. aureus nasal colonization in patients undergoing CAPD. Periodic re-treatment is frequently necessary, given the significant recolonization rate.

Abstract 117 of 500

Narrow band UVB is succeeding psoralen and UVA irradiation as the main treatment of vitiligo vulgaris in several European countries. Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency in some vitiligo patients has prompted researchers to investigate the efficacy of these vitamins in the treatment of vitiligo. In the present controlled study we investigated the value of narrow band UVB phototherapy in the treatment of vitiligo and the possible additive effect of vitamin B12 and folic acid. Twenty-seven patients with long-term stable vitiligo were included and randomized in a "UVB only" (UVB) or "UVB combined with vitamin B12 and folic acid" (UVB+) group. Patients were irradiated thrice weekly for one year, whilst repigmentation was carefully monitored. In 92% (25/27) of the patients up to 100% repigmentation was seen. Repigmentation was notable in lesions on the face, neck and throat, lower arm, chest, back and lower legs, whilst repigmentation on the hands, wrists, feet and ankles proved to be minimal. Maximum repigmentation rates did not differ significantly between the UVB group and the UVB+ group. Our study reconfirms that narrow band UVB phototherapy is an effective treatment for vitiligo and shows that co-treatment with vitamin B12 and folic acid does not improve the outcome of treatment of vitiligo with narrow band UVB phototherapy.

Abstract 118 of 500

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are widely prescribed for children with autism spectrum disorders. To determine the efficacy and safety of <tx1_a>citalopram hydrobromide therapy</tx1_a> for repetitive behavior in children with autism spectrum disorders. National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized controlled trial. Six academic centers, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of California at Los Angeles, Yale University, and Dartmouth Medical School. <n>One hundred forty-nine</n> volunteers 5 to 17 years old (mean [SD] age, 9.4 [3.1] years) were randomized to receive <tx1>citalopram</tx1> (n = <n1>73</n1>) or <tx2>placebo</tx2> (n = <n2>76</n2>). Participants had autistic spectrum disorders, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified; had illness severity ratings of at least moderate on the Clinical Global Impressions, Severity of Illness Scale; and scored at least moderate on compulsive behaviors measured with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Twelve weeks of <tx1_a>citalopram hydrobromide</tx1_a> (10 mg/5 mL) or <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>. The mean (SD) maximum dosage of <tx1_a>citalopram hydrobromide</tx1_a> was 16.5 (6.5) mg/d by mouth (maximum, 20 mg/d). Positive response was defined by a score of much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale. An important secondary outcome was the score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Adverse events were systematically elicited using the Safety Monitoring Uniform Report Form. There was no significant difference in the rate of positive response on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale between the <tx1_a>citalopram</tx1_a>-treated group (32.9%) and the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group (34.2%) (relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.51; P > .99). There was no difference in score reduction on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders from baseline (mean [SD], -2.0 [3.4] points for the <tx1_a>citalopram</tx1_a>-treated group and -1.9 [2.5] points for the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group; P = .81). <tx1_a>Citalopram</tx1_a> use was significantly more likely to be associated with adverse events, particularly increased energy level, impulsiveness, decreased concentration, hyperactivity, stereotypy, diarrhea, insomnia, and dry skin or pruritus. Results of this trial do not support the use of <tx1_a>citalopram</tx1_a> for the treatment of repetitive behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.

Abstract 120 of 500

To measure the blood flow distribution and regional oxygen transport in hyperdynamic septic shock during hypotension and after correction by vasopressor doses of dopamine or norepinephrine. Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Tertiary care center. Ten patients with hyperdynamic septic shock (ages ranging from 45.1 +/- 16.6 yrs) and a control group of 11 postoperative cardiac surgery patients (ages ranging from 54.8 +/- 7.9 yrs). Systemic and regional hemodynamics and oxygen transport were measured in ten patients with hyperdynamic septic shock during hypotension and after vasopressor therapy (norepinephrine or dopamine). Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured by indirect calorimetry and splanchnic and leg blood flow with indocyanine green infusion. Splanchnic blood flow and VO2 (p < .05) were increased in septic shock during hypotension and during vasopressor therapy. Both dopamine and norepinephrine increased systemic blood flow and VO2 independently of the arterial lactate level. Despite the relatively small changes in systemic oxygen transport, major regional changes occurred in oxygen delivery and VO2, and these changes were unpredictable from systemic changes. Regional changes in oxygen transport in septic shock cannot be predicted from the changes in the whole body. The increased oxygen demand in the splanchnic region is the main risk factor for splanchnic tissue hypoxia in septic shock.

Abstract 121 of 500

Topical NSAIDs have been proven to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) in short-term studies (2 weeks). To justify its chronic use, efficacy of a topical NSAID over a longer term of study should be demonstrated. The efficacy and safety of a <tx1_a>topical diclofenac solution</tx1_a> over a 6-week treatment course in symptomatic primary OA of the knee was investigated. <n>216</n> men and women, age 40-85 years, with radiologically confirmed primary OA of the knee and a flare of pain at baseline following discontinuation of prior therapy were enrolled into this double-blind study. Participants applied either a <tx1>topical diclofenac solution (Pennsaid)</tx1> or <tx2>vehicle control solution (carrier with no diclofenac)</tx2>; 40 drops 4 times daily directly to the painful knee(s), without massage, for 6 weeks. Pre-planned primary efficacy outcome measures included the core continuous variables pain relief and improved physical function measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) LK3.1 OA Index, and improved patient global assessment (PGA). Secondary efficacy measure was reduced stiffness. Safety assessments included adverse events and vital signs. The <tx1_a>topical diclofenac</tx1_a> group had a significantly greater mean change in score (final minus baseline) compared to the <tx2_a>vehicle control</tx2_a> group for pain (-5.2 vs. -3.3, p = 0.003), physical function (-13.4 vs. -6.9, p = 0.001), PGA (-1.3 vs. -0.7, p = 0.0001) and stiffness (-1.8 vs. -0.9, p = 0.002). The mean difference between treatment arms (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 1.9 (0.7 to 3.2), 6.5 (2.5 to 10.5), 0.6 (0.2 to 0.9), and 0.9 (0.3 to 1.4), respectively. Safety analyses showed that <tx1_a>topical diclofenac</tx1_a> caused skin irritation, mostly minor local skin dryness, in 42/107 (39%), leading to discontinuation of treatment in 5/107 (5%) participants. This <tx1_a>topical diclofenac solution</tx1_a> demonstrated relief at 6 weeks of the symptoms of primary osteoarthritis of the knee.

The efficacy of an <tx1>orally administered calcium antagonist, nifedipine</tx1>, in suppressing premature uterine activity, was compared with <tx2>intravenous ritodrine</tx2> and <tx3>no treatment</tx3>. <tx1_a>Nifedipine</tx1_a> was found to be significantly more effective than <tx2_a>ritodrine</tx2_a> or <tx3_a>withholding therapy</tx3_a>, and was almost devoid of side-effects.

Abstract 123 of 500

The 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome' (SIRS) may represent the underlying cause of complications after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This study was conducted to determine whether blocking the etiologic factors of SIRS could improve the complications of BMT. <n>Sixteen</n> consecutive patients with unrelated donors were allocated alternately to two groups. <n1>Seven</n1> patients received <tx1>1.8 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) orally from 3 weeks before to about 180 days after transplantation</tx1>, while <n2>nine</n2> patients did not. These two groups were compared with respect to complications, survival, and various cytokines and factors causing vascular endothelial damage. All seven patients receiving <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a> survived and only two had grade III graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Among the nine patients <tx2>not receiving <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a></tx2>, three had grade III or IV GVHD. In addition, thrombotic microangiopathy developed in four patients and cytomegalovirus disease occurred in four. Five patients died in this group. The levels of leukotriene B(4), thromboxane A(2), and prostaglandin I(2) were significantly lower in patients receiving <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a> than in those not receiving it (all P < 0.01). Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-10 were also significantly decreased by <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a> (P < 0.05), as were factors causing vascular endothelial damage such as thrombomodulin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P < 0.05). The survival rate was significantly higher in the group given <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a> (P < 0.01). <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a> significantly reduced the complications of BMT, indicating that these complications may be manifestations of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

Abstract 124 of 500

Improved drug therapy for schizophrenia may represent the best strategy for reducing the costs of schizophrenia and the recurrent chronic course of the disease. <tx1>Olanzapine</tx1> and <tx2>risperidone</tx2> are atypical antipsychotic agents developed to meet this need. We report a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, 30-week study designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and associated resource use for <tx1_a>olanzapine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a> in Australia and New Zealand. The study sample consisted of <n>65</n> patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder. <tx1_a>Olanzapine</tx1_a>-treated patients showed a significantly greater reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, and PANSS General Psychopathology scores at endpoint compared to the <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a>-treated patients. Response rates through 30 weeks showed a significantly greater proportion of <tx1_a>olanzapine</tx1_a>-treated patients had achieved a 20% or greater improvement in their PANSS total score compared to <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a>-treated patients. <tx1_a>Olanzapine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a> were equivalent in their improvement of PANSS positive and negative scores and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) at endpoint. Using generic and disease-specific measures of quality of life, <tx1_a>olanzapine</tx1_a>-treated patients showed significant within-group improvement in most measures, and significant differences were observed in favor of <tx1_a>olanzapine</tx1_a> over <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a> in Quality of Life Scale (QLS) Intrapsychic Foundation and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item instrument (SF-36) Role Functioning Limitations-Emotional subscale scores. Despite the relatively small sample size, our study suggests that <tx1_a>olanzapine</tx1_a> has a superior risk:benefit profile compared to <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a>.

Abstract 125 of 500

To clarify the effectiveness of <tx1_a>amoxicillin prophylaxis</tx1_a> in the prevention of catheter-related infections. We performed a randomized, controlled, sequential, prospective trial in newborn infants undergoing percutaneous central venous catheterization. <n1>Seventy-five</n1> infants (median birth weight, 1240 gm; median age at catheter insertion, 3 days) received <tx1>prophylactic amoxicillin (100 mg/kg per day)</tx1>; <n2>73</n2> infants in the control group (median birth weight, 1170 gm; median age, 2 days) received <tx2>no routine prophylactic antibiotic treatment</tx2>. No infant receiving <tx1_a>amoxicillin</tx1_a> had septicemia, whereas two infants (2.7%) in the control group did; suspected septicemia (positive clinical and laboratory findings but negative blood culture results) was found in 3 infants in the <tx1_a>amoxicillin</tx1_a> group and in 6 of the control group (not significantly). Bacterial contamination of the catheter tip at removal was significantly reduced in the <tx1_a>amoxicillin</tx1_a> group (13.3% vs 28.8% in control subjects; p < 0.05). Negligible differences were found in duration of catheterization (median, 15 days in both groups), or the number of thrombotic (9.3% vs 2.7% in control subjects) and other catheter-related complications between the groups. A low incidence of catheter-related infections can be achieved in neonates with central venous catheters without using prophylaxis with an antibiotic.

Abstract 126 of 500

We evaluated the efficacy of mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray in decreasing adenoid size and reducing the severity of chronic nasal obstruction symptoms in children affected by adenoidal hypertrophy. Sixty children were recruited in a 2-stage, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. All patients complained of chronic nasal obstruction symptoms, and nasal endoscopy showed >75% choanal obstruction attributable to adenoid pads. In the first stage, 30 patients (group A) underwent mometasone treatment (50 microg per nostril per day) for 40 days, and 30 children (group B) received placebo. In the second stage, at the end of the first 40-day treatment period, patients in group A who showed subjective and objective clinical improvement were divided into 2 subgroups; group A1 (11 children) received topical intranasal steroid treatment on alternate days for the first 2 weeks per month, whereas group A2 (10 children) continued daily mometasone treatment for the first 2 weeks per month. After 3 months, all children were reassessed. Fifty-seven children completed the study according to the protocol. After the first treatment period, the severity of symptoms and adenoid size decreased for 21 patients (77.7%) in group A. No improvement was observed in the placebo group. After 3 months of additional therapy, group A2 patients demonstrated a more-pronounced reduction in adenoid size compared with group A1 patients. No statistically significant change in symptoms was identified. Mometasone treatment was well tolerated by all patients. Mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray may be considered useful in decreasing adenoid pad size and the severity of symptoms related to adenoidal hypertrophy. Children with adenoidal hypertrophy that is not associated with tonsillar hypertrophy should be considered for intranasal mometasone treatment before surgery is planned.

Abstract 127 of 500

Different mechanical devices have been developed to improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The aim of this study was to evaluate <tx1_a>active compression-decompression (ACD) CPR</tx1_a> applied by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) in a defined population. The Trondheim region EMS (population 154,000) employs simultaneous paramedic and physician response. Upon decision to treat, patients with cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin were allocated to <tx1>ACD CPR (CardioPump)</tx1> or <tx2>standard CPR</tx2> by drawing a random number tag. Outcome in each patient was determined on a 5 point ordinal scale (no clinical improvement = 1, survival to discharge = 5). In 4 years, <tx2_a><tx1_a>CPR</tx1_a></tx2_a> was attempted in a total of <n>431</n> cardiac arrests, 54 patients (13%) survived to discharge; 302 patients with similar baseline characteristics were randomised. The prevalence of bystander <tx2_a><tx1_a>CPR</tx1_a></tx2_a> was 57% and the median call-arrival interval 9 min. By intention to treat, the mean score in the <tx2_a>standard <tx1_a>CPR</tx1_a></tx2_a> group was 2.51 and 17/<n2>145</n2> patients (12%) survived. The mean score in the <tx1_a>ACD <tx2_a>CPR</tx2_a></tx1_a> group was 2.53 (P = 0.9) and 20/<n2>157</n2> patients (13%) survived. Cerebral outcome was similar in the two groups. Among the <n1_a>145</n1_a> <tx2_a>ACD</tx2_a> patients, the technique was successfully applied in 110, found inapplicable in 35 and in seven patients chest compressions were unnecessary. This is the largest, single-centre, randomised, population based study of <tx1_a>ACD <tx2_a>CPR</tx2_a></tx1_a> in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to date. Even when considering a wider outcome spectrum than crude survival, we found no evidence of clinical benefit. In a quarter of cases <tx1_a>ACD <tx2_a>CPR</tx2_a></tx1_a> was inapplicable, further limiting its potential usefulness.

Abstract 128 of 500

A double-blind, five-week, multicenter trial was conducted to compare the effect of <tx1_a>baclofen</tx1_a>, a unique amino acid derivative, with that of <tx2>placebo</tx2> in the treatment of <n>106</n> patients with spasticity secondary to multiple sclerosis. A spasticity assessment method that included a neurological examination, physicians' clinical impressions of changes during treatment, and a patient's self-evaluation was used to determine efficacy. This method showed <tx1>baclofen (70 to 80 mg daily maximum, titrated)</tx1> is effective relative to <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> in relieving symptoms of spasticity, such as flexor spasms, pain and stiffness, resistance to passive joint movements, and tendon stretch reflexes. Patient self-evaluation results also showed a significant reduction in clonus. Side effects were generally mild and transient.

Abstract 129 of 500

For psoriasis therapy, topical derivatives of vitamin D3 represent a versatile option: they can be used either alone or in combination with other agents such as topical corticosteroids. In this two-phase parallel-group study, the naturally occurring vitamin D3 analogue, calcitriol, was compared with the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol in 125 patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis. The proposed treatment regimen was an initial bitherapy for 2 or 4 weeks, with clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream, a super potent topical corticosteroid applied in the morning and either calcitriol 3 mug/g ointment or calcipotriol 50 mug/g ointment applied in the evening, followed by monotherapy with either calcitriol or calcipotriol applied twice daily until endpoint week 12. Efficacy evaluations (global assessment of improvement, PASI and body surface area (BSA) affected) showed no significant differences between the two regimen groups at the primary endpoints (week 2 and week 12) or at any interim points. At week 2 the investigator's global assessment showed clinical success (psoriasis markedly improved, almost clear or clear) for more than 50% of the patients in both groups and for 48 (79%) and 56 (88%) patients, respectively in the calcitriol and calcipotriol regimen group at week 12. Least-square means analysis of PASI indicated the calcitriol regimen to be equivalent to the calcipotriol regimen. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regards to cutaneous safety or to incidence of adverse events. The present study shows that for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis calcitriol 3 mug/g ointment can provide a safe and effective alternative to calcipotriol 50 mug/g ointment while being administered within a regimen based on a bitherapy with corticosteroids followed by a vitamin D3 maintenance monotherapy.

Abstract 130 of 500

In contrast to the use of opioids for the treatment of acute and chronic cancer pain, the administration of <tx1_a>chronic opioid therapy</tx1_a> for pain not due to malignancy remains controversial. We describe <n>100</n> patients who were chronically given <tx1_a>opioids</tx1_a> for treatment of nonmalignant pain. Most patients experienced neuropathic pain or back pain. We used sustained-release <tx1>dihydrocodeine, buprenorphine, and sustained-release morphine</tx1>. Pain reduction was measured with visual analogue scales (VAS), and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale was used to assess the patient's function. Good pain relief was obtained in 51 patients and partial pain relief was reported by 28 patients. Only 21 patients had no beneficial effect from opioid therapy. There was a close correlation between the sum and the peak VAS values (r = 0.983; p less than 0.0001) and pain reduction was associated with an increase in performance (p less than 0.0001). The most common side effects were constipation and nausea. There were no cases of respiratory depression or addiction to <tx1_a>opioids</tx1_a>. Our results indicate that <tx1_a>opioids</tx1_a> can be effective in chronic nonmalignant pain, with side effects that are comparable to those that complicate the treatment of cancer pain.

Abstract 131 of 500

<n>Eighty three</n> patients with neutropenia and cancer were randomised to receive either <tx1>1 g meropenem tds</tx1> or <tx2>amikacin 15 mg/kg single dose daily plus ceftazidime 2 g tds</tx2>. No prophylactic antibiotics were allowed before entry to the trial. Seventy seven patients were available for analysis. Infection was microbiologically or clinically documented in 53 episodes (69%). The overall success rate without adjustment was 49% in monotherapy, 37.5% in the combination group. These rates were increased to 65% and 56%, respectively when secondary infection episodes requiring a different class of chemotherapy were taken into account. Median duration for defervescence was 3 days in successfully treated patients in both groups. Only minor reversible side effects were noted in both treatment arms. <tx1_a>Meropenem monotherapy</tx1_a> seemed as effective and safe as <tx2_a>amikacin plus ceftazidime</tx2_a> for the empirical treatment of neutropenic cancer patients with fever.

Abstract 132 of 500

It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Because this issue remains controversial, we studied the incidence of such complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study. The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial is a prospective, randomized, blinded trial comparing the effects of moderate control of blood pressure (target diastolic pressure, 80 to 89 mm Hg) with those of intensive control of blood pressure (diastolic pressure, 75 mm Hg) on the incidence and progression of complications of diabetes. The study also compared nisoldipine with enalapril as a first-line antihypertensive agent in terms of the prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In the current study, we analyzed data on a secondary end point (the incidence of myocardial infarction) in the subgroup of patients in the ABCD Trial who had hypertension. Analysis of the 470 patients in the trial who had hypertension (base-line diastolic blood pressure, > or = 90 mm Hg) showed similar control of blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid concentrations, and smoking behavior in the nisoldipine group (237 patients) and the enalapril group (233 patients) throughout five years of follow-up. Using a multiple logistic-regression model with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 33.8). In this population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation.

Abstract 133 of 500

Using an open randomised controlled study, we examined the effectiveness of manual and electroacupuncture on symptom relief for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee were randomised to one of three treatment groups. Group A had <tx1><tx>acupuncture</tx> alone</tx1>, group B had <tx2><tx_a>acupuncture</tx_a> but continued on their symptomatic medication</tx2>, and group C <tx3>used their symptomatic medication for the first five weeks and then had a course of <tx_a>acupuncture</tx_a> added</tx3>. Patients receiving <tx_a>acupuncture</tx_a> were treated twice weekly over five weeks. Needles were inserted (with manual and electrical stimulation) in <tx_a>acupuncture</tx_a> points for pain and stiffness, selected according to traditional <tx_a>acupuncture</tx_a> theory for treating Bi syndrome. Patients were assessed by a blinded observer before treatment, after five weeks' treatment and at one month follow up, using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario McMaster (WOMAC) questionnaire for osteoarthritis of the knee. The <n>30</n> patients in our study were well matched for age, body mass index, disease duration, baseline VAS pain score and baseline WOMAC scores. Repeated measure analyses gave a highly significant improvement in pain (VAS) after the courses of <tx_a>acupuncture</tx_a> in groups A (P = 0.012) and B (P=0.001); there was no change in group C until after the course of <tx_a>acupuncture</tx_a>, when the improvement was significant (P = 0.001). Similarly significant changes were seen with the WOMAC pain and stiffness scores. These benefits were maintained during the one month after the course of <tx_a>acupuncture</tx_a>. Patients' rating of global assessment was higher than that of the acupuncturist. We conclude that manual and electroacupuncture causes a significant improvement in the symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee, either on its own or as an adjunct therapy, with no loss of benefit after one month.

Abstract 135 of 500

Our purpose was to determine the effect of ceftizoxime in the prolongation of pregnancies receiving tocolysis for preterm labor. A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients with preterm labor between 24 and 35 weeks' gestation. A total of 545 patients with intact membranes and without chorioamnionitis who were receiving magnesium sulfate were screened. Exclusions were for advanced cervical dilatation, penicillin allergy, current antibiotic therapy, and failure to give informed consent. Of these, 117 consecutive, eligible, consenting patients were randomized to receive either 2 gm of ceftizoxime or a placebo every 8 hours. The primary end point was prolongation of gestation. Statistical comparisons were performed by use of unpaired two-tailed t tests and chi 2 analysis. Of the 58 ceftizoxime and 59 placebo patients, there was no difference in the interval to delivery (34.5 +/- 21.1 days vs 34.6 +/- 24.5 days, p = 0.99) and no difference in the rate of delivery before 37 weeks' gestation (60% in the ceftizoxime group vs 58% in the placebo group, p = 0.91). Subanalyses of 61 subjects who received nine or more doses and who were group B streptococci negative, 69 patients at < or = 32 weeks on presentation, and 22 sets of twins all showed no differences in delivery interval or rate of delivery at < 37 weeks. The sample size of this study was sufficient to detect a 9-day difference in prolongation of pregnancy (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2). Ceftizoxime had no effect on interval to delivery or duration of pregnancy in women treated for preterm labor.

Abstract 136 of 500

A study on induction of labor was carried out to test the hypothesis that changing the cervix will enhance the effectiveness of induction of labor. <n>Fifty</n> pregnant women near term with Bishop scores of 4 or less were divided into 5 study groups, in which a 12-hour preparation phase procedure was carried out to produce cervical or myometrial changes. All women had continuous measurement of uterine activity by an extraovular catheter. The patients were divided into 1) <tx1>control</tx1> subjects, and into groups treated with 2) <tx2>laminaria</tx2>, 3) <tx3>Foley catheter</tx3>, 4) <tx4>amniotomy</tx4>, and 5) <tx5>oxytocin infusion</tx5>. These preparation techniques were used for 12 hours, after which rupture of membranes was carried out in all cases. Although all procedures significantly changed the cervix, none but <tx5_a>oxytocin</tx5_a> affected the induction-to-delivery interval. The authors concluded that when a study design rigidly controls for cervical Bishop score, timing of rupture of membranes, and <tx5_a>oxytocin</tx5_a> infusion rates, the cervical preparation alone will not enhance inducibility.

A double-blind comparative trial of <tx1>loxapine</tx1> and <tx2>trifluoperazine</tx2> was carried out in <n>57</n> acute and chronic schizophrenic patients. In both groups of patients <tx1_a>loxapine</tx1_a> proved to be equivalent in its effects to <tx2_a>trifluoperazine</tx2_a> and there were suggestions it might be rather more effective in chronic patients. Side-effects were similar with the two drugs but anticholinergic effects, excitement, dizziness and faintness occurred rather more commonly with <tx1_a>loxapine</tx1_a>. Laboratory tests, urine analysis, cardiovascular and ophthalmological investigations showed no significant abnormalities.

Abstract 138 of 500

Weight gain is a common adverse effect associated with the use of most antipsychotic drugs. Leptin has been reported to be associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship between the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine and serum leptin levels. We planned to comparatively investigate the effects of the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine on leptin and triglyceride levels and weight gain. The study population comprised 56 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia, who were divided into 4 treatment groups: quetiapine (N = 14), olanzapine (N = 14), risperidone (N = 14), or clozapine (N = 14) monotherapy, and a control group of 11 patients receiving no psychopharmacologic treatment. The patients were evaluated at baseline and at the sixth week according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), body mass index (BMI), weight, and fasting serum leptin and triglyceride levels. Data were gathered in 2001 and 2002. Olanzapine and clozapine caused a marked increase in weight and serum triglyceride and leptin levels, though increases in these variables were modest in the patients receiving quetiapine and minimal in those receiving risperidone. There were positive correlations between serum leptin levels and BMI and triglyceride levels. Clinical efficacy, as indicated by decrease in total PANSS scores, was associated with leptin levels in all atypical antipsychotic groups. Our results suggest that leptin may be associated with olanzapine- and clozapine-induced weight gain and that quetiapine appears to have modest influence and risperidone appears to have minimal influence on leptin and triglyceride levels and weight gain compared with olanzapine and clozapine.

Abstract 139 of 500

Smoking cessation has been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials. It is unclear though, whether interventions also work in routine primary care. In 167 primary care settings we conducted a randomized four-armed smoking cessation trial to examine the efficacy of a <tx1>minimal intervention (MI</tx1>; n = <n1>81</n1>), <tx2>cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT</tx2>; n = <n2>175</n2>), <tx3>bupropion (BUP</tx3>; n = <n3>108</n3>) and <tx4>nicotine replacements (NRT</tx4>; n = <n4>103</n4>). Overall, <n>467</n> current smokers were enrolled. Abstinence rates at the end of treatment (12 weeks) were 32.8% for <tx1_a>MI</tx1_a> patients, 34.8% for <tx2_a>CBT</tx2_a>, 35.3% for <tx4_a>NRT</tx4_a>, and 46.5% for <tx3_a>BUP</tx3_a> patients (ITT, intention to treat) (no differential effects). Retention rates were highest in the <tx3_a>BUP</tx3_a> group (59.3%) and lowest in the <tx4_a>NRT</tx4_a> group (50.5%). Completer findings were: <tx1_a>MI</tx1_a>, 56.4%; <tx2_a>CBT</tx2_a>, 64%; <tx3_a>BUP</tx3_a>, 79.3%; <tx4_a>NRT</tx4_a>, 69.2% (LOCF, lost to follow-up). No serious adverse events occurred during or after the medication phase. At 12-month follow-up continuous abstinence rates were: <tx3_a>BUP</tx3_a>, 29.0%; <tx2_a>CBT</tx2_a>, 20.9%; <tx4_a>NRT</tx4_a>, 29.6%; <tx1_a>MI</tx1_a>, 29.6%. Our findings suggest that established smoking cessation treatments are effective when applied by non-specialist primary care physicians. Our data supports a structured, multimodal treatment structure as core ingredient of successful smoking cessation in primary care. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract 140 of 500

Lipid targets can be difficult to attain in familial hypercholesterolaemia. To compare <tx1>atorvastatin</tx1> with <tx2>simvastatin-fenofibrate</tx2> and <tx3>simvastatin-cholestyramine therapy</tx3>, we studied <n>54</n> patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia over periods of 2-6 months on each therapeutic regimen. The <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> regimen reduced total cholesterol by 41.2 +/- 11.2%, LDL by 45.6 +/- 15.5%, triglycerides by 33.8 +/- 24.8%, and increased HDL by 2.3 +/- 37.0%. <tx2_a>Simvastatin-fenofibrate therapy</tx2_a> achieved reductions of 33.9 +/- 8.5% in cholesterol, 42.0 +/- 12.2% in LDL, 34.7 +/- 38.3% for triglycerides, and a 25.4 +/- 55.1% increase in HDL. <tx3_a>Simvastatin-cholestyramine</tx3_a> gave a reduction of 31.3 +/- 11.8% in cholesterol, 36.0 +/- 14.4% in LDL, 13.7 +/- 36.3% in triglycerides, and a 1.1 +/- 30.3% rise in HDL. The <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> regimen was marginally but not significantly better than <tx2_a>simvastatin-fenofibrate</tx2_a> in improving the LDL:HDL ratio, LDL:apoB and and apolipoprotein B:A1 ratios. Eleven patients (20.4%) had side-effects: two discontinued <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> due to side-effects; two patients had rashes; six had myalgia and two had diarrhoea. Gastrointestinal side-effects were described in 16 (30.1%) patients on <tx3_a>simvastatin-cholestyramine</tx3_a> therapy and four cases of myalgia (11.2%) were seen with <tx2_a>simvastatin-fenofibrate</tx2_a>. In nine patients on <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> (20.4%) a 30% or greater fall in HDL was observed, compared to five patients with resin therapy (9.2%) and two with fibrate therapy (5.5%). There were no significant differences in liver or muscle biochemistry between the regimens, but <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> did raise transaminase and creatine kinase concentrations significantly compared to pre-treatment values (p = 0.001). <tx1_a>Atorvastatin</tx1_a> significantly improves the lipid profile in most patients compared with other regimens. It has a comparable incidence of side-effects to combination therapy regimens.

Abstract 142 of 500

To evaluate risk factors for anal incontinence using an identical twin sisters study design to provide control over genetic variance. A total of <n>271</n> identical twin sister pairs (mean age 47 years) completed the validated Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory questionnaire detailing the presence and severity of anal incontinence. Data were analyzed using a stepwise logistic regression with repeated binary measures to account for correlated data within twin pairs. Three different statistical models were used to analyze nonobstetric as well as obstetric risk factors separately. Significant risk factors for anal incontinence and higher Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory anal incontinence subscale scores included age 40 years or older (fecal: odds ratio [OR] 2.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-6.0; flatal: OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.11-3.24), menopause (fecal: OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.15-3.8; flatal: OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.43-3.13), increasing parity (parity > or = 2; fecal: OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.25-7.65; flatal: OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.65-4.51), and the presence of stress urinary incontinence (fecal: OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.12-3.98; flatal: OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.14-2.59). Obesity was associated with significantly higher Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory anal incontinence subscale scores (mean difference 5.18, P = .007). Cesarean delivery after initiation of labor was associated with a lower prevalence of anal incontinence than vaginal birth; however, this difference was not statistically significant (17% compared with 4%, P = .11). No anal incontinence was noted in women who had only elective cesarean deliveries. Age, menopause, obesity, parity, and stress urinary incontinence are the major risk factors for female anal incontinence.

Abstract 143 of 500

<tx1_a>Neostigmine</tx1_a>, used for reversal of neuromuscular block, has been implicated in the development of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). The use of mivacurium, which does not require neostigmine reversal due to its metabolism by plasma cholinesterase, has made it possible to study the effect of neostigmine on PONV in a randomised, double-blind, <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled manner. <n>Ninety</n> healthy women scheduled for laparoscopic gynaecological surgery were randomly allocated to two groups in a double-blind manner. One group was given <tx1>neostigmine (50 microg kg(-1)) and glycopyrrolate (10 microg kg(-1)) (group NG)</tx1>, the other <tx2>NaCl i.v. as placebo (group P)</tx2> at the end of surgery when all the patients were spontaneously reversed to at least 75% of full muscle power. The risk of PONV was reduced by using low doses of opioids and ondansetron prophylaxis. All the patients were monitored and assessed for 24 h with regard to pain, nausea, vomiting and overall satisfaction. There was a statistically significant difference (P=0.03) in the occurrence of nausea during the first 6 h postoperatively between <tx1_a>NG</tx1_a> group (30%) and <tx2_a>P</tx2_a> group (11%), resulting in the more extensive use of antiemetic drugs in the <tx1_a>NG</tx1_a> group (28%) than in <tx2_a>P</tx2_a> group (7%) (P=0.01) in this period. There was no difference between the groups in the frequency of vomiting; seven nauseated patients had vomiting, four in group <tx1_a>NG</tx1_a>, three in group <tx2_a>P</tx2_a>. Total number of patients with PONV during the observation period of 24 h, usage of antiemetic rescue medication and overall patient satisfaction did not differ significantly between the groups. The results suggest that antagonism of neuromuscular block with a high dose of <tx1_a>neostigmine</tx1_a> increases postoperative nausea and the use of antiemetic drugs during the first 6 h after administration.

Abstract 144 of 500

We studied the possible interaction between rifampin and doxycycline in 20 patients with brucellosis treated randomly with either doxycycline and streptomycin or doxycycline and rifampin. The doxycycline levels in the plasma of patients in the group treated with rifampin were significantly lower than those in the plasma of patients treated with doxycycline and streptomycin. Furthermore, clearance in patients treated with rifampin was significantly higher than that in patients treated with doxycycline and streptomycin, and consequently, the elimination half-life and the area under the concentration-time curve were significantly lower. There was no therapeutic failure or relapse in the group treated with doxycycline and streptomycin, whereas 2 of 10 patients in the group treated with doxycycline and rifampin had a therapeutic failure or relapse. The plasma doxycycline levels had an inverse correlation with plasma rifampin levels. In the group treated with rifampin, those who were rapid acetylators had lower levels of doxycycline. In conclusion, combined treatment with rifampin reduces the levels of doxycycline in plasma. These data suggest that therapeutic failures or relapses may result from this interaction.

Abstract 145 of 500

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of <tx2_a>nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution and salbutamol</tx2_a> in the treatment of mild to moderate bronchiolitis. In a randomized controlled trial, <n>93</n> infants with mild to moderate bronchiolitis were divided into two groups. The infants received <tx1>inhalation of 2.5 mg (0.5 mL) salbutamol dissolved in either 4.0 mL normal (0.9%) saline (control group</tx1>, n= <n1>43</n1>) or <tx2>4.0 mL hypertonic (3%) saline (treatment group</tx2>, n= <n2>50</n2>). The therapy was repeated three times daily until discharge. Cough, wheezing, pulmonary physical signs, and the length of hospital stay were recorded. Wheezing remission time was 3.8 + or - 1.1 days in the control group and 2.7 + or - 0.9 days in the treatment group (P < 0.01). Cough remission time was 6.3 + or - 0.9 days in the control group and 5.3 + or - 0.8 days in the treatment group (P < 0.01). The moist crackles disappeared at 5.4 + or - 0.8 days in the treatment group versus 6.2 + or - 0.9 days in the control group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the average length of hospital stay decreased from 7.4 + or - 1.5 days in the control group to 6.0 + or - 1.2 days in the treatment group (P < 0.01). No obvious adverse effects were observed. <tx2_a>Inhalation of nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution and salbutamol</tx2_a> is a safe and effective therapy for patients with mild to moderate bronchiolitis.

Abstract 146 of 500

This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of <tx1_a>oral erythromycin treatment</tx1_a> in safely prolonging pregnancy among women experiencing preterm premature rupture of membranes. <n>Sixty-five</n> women were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with either <tx1>erythromycin base</tx1> or an identical-appearing <tx2>placebo</tx2> three times daily for 7 days. Only women between 23 and 34 completed weeks' gestation who did not have an indication for delivery were enrolled in the study. Pretreatment microbiologic tests were obtained and women were followed expectantly. Fifty-five women and their newborns completed the protocol and were fully evaluated. Overall, time from rupture of membranes to onset of labor and to delivery was longer, although not significantly, for <tx1_a>erythromycin</tx1_a>-treated women. Similarly, there was a trend for reduced neonatal intensive care (level II, p = 0.07). When gestational age at enrollment was controlled, <tx1_a>erythromycin</tx1_a> treatment of women between 28 to 32 weeks' gestation was associated with a prolonged interval from enrollment to delivery [<tx1_a>erythromycin</tx1_a>: 292 hours (5 to 679); <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>: 54 (12 to 323); p less than 0.044]. Fifty percent of <tx1_a>erythromycin</tx1_a>-treated women between 28 to 32 weeks' gestation continued their pregnancies at least 13 days after premature rupture of membranes, whereas 50% of <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-treated women were delivered of infants within 4 days (p = 0.02). <tx1_a>Erythromycin</tx1_a> treatment among women less than 28 and between 33 to 34 weeks' gestation was not associated with prolonged latency or other changes. There were no differences between <tx1_a>erythromycin</tx1_a>- and <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-treated women in the occurrence of clinically recognized chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, or neonatal infectious morbidity. In this double-blind, <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled trial, <tx1_a>erythromycin</tx1_a> treatment was well tolerated, safe, and associated with prolongation of pregnancy and reduced intensive neonatal care requirements for selected mother-newborn pairs with preterm premature rupture of membranes.

Abstract 147 of 500

To assess the effectiveness of low-intensity laser therapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal low back pain. A double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. A physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic. Sixty-three ambulatory men and women between the ages of 18 and 70yrs with symptomatic nonradiating low back pain of more than 30 days' duration and normal neurologic examination results. Subjects were bloc randomized into two groups with a computer-generated schedule. All underwent irradiation for 90 seconds at eight symmetric points along the lumbosacral spine three times a week for 4 weeks by a masked therapist. The sole difference between the groups was that the probes of a 1.06 microm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser emitted 542mW/cm2 for the treated subjects and were inactive for the control subjects. Subject's perception of benefit, level of function as assessed by the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and lumbar mobility. The treated group had a time-dependent improvement in two of the three outcome measures: perception of benefit and level of function. These results were most marked at the midpoint evaluation (p < .005, p < .01) and end of treatment (p < .017, p < .001) but tended to lessen at the 1-month follow-up (p < .10, p < .004). Lumbar mobility did not differ between the groups at any time. All tests were two-sample t tests with unequal variances. Treatment with low-intensity 1.06 microm laser irradiation produced a moderate reduction in pain and improvement in function in patients with musculoskeletal low back pain. Benefits, however, were limited and decreased with time. Further research is warranted.

Abstract 148 of 500

Activated B cells have recently been shown to produce soluble CD23 from their membranes. The serum-soluble CD23 concentration in <n>21</n> patients with pelvic pain diagnosed as having endometriosis and confirmed by histology, and in 18 patients without pelvic pain, who had a normal pelvis during laparoscopic sterilization, was studied by chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The endometriosis patients were randomized to 3 months of either <tx1>danazol</tx1> or <tx2>leuprolide acetate injection</tx2>. Serum was taken before and after 3 months of therapy. The serum-soluble CD23 concentration was significantly elevated in patients with endometriosis when compared with the controls (P < 0.0001). There was no correlation between soluble CD23 concentrations and the severity of endometriosis (r = 0.48, P > 0.05). The serum concentration of soluble CD23 decreased significantly on treatment with <tx1_a>danazol</tx1_a> but not <tx2_a>leuprolide acetate</tx2_a> (P < 0.05). We conclude that the elevation of soluble CD23 in patients with endometriosis suggests that there is activation of B cells, which respond to <tx1_a>danazol</tx1_a> but not <tx2_a>leuprolide acetate injection</tx2_a>.

Abstract 149 of 500

In a clinical trial of <n>172</n> patients at four medical centers, <tx1>interferon alfa-2b (1.5 x 10(6) IU)</tx1> or a <tx2>placebo</tx2> was injected directly into biopsy-proved noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas three times weekly for 3 weeks, for a cumulative dose of 13.5 million IU. Efficacy of treatment was determined at 16 to 20 weeks by examination of biopsy specimens that demonstrated cure of lesions in 86% of <tx1_a>interferon</tx1_a>-treated patients and in only 29% of <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-treated patients. During the treatment course and follow-up, an initial inflammatory response was observed at the treatment sites, followed by diminished erythema, improvement in overall appearance, and a decrease in size of lesions. Side effects of treatment, mainly flu-like symptoms, were usually mild and transient and occurred more commonly in the <tx1_a>interferon</tx1_a>-treated group. Only three patients, all in the <tx1_a>interferon</tx1_a>-treated group, discontinued therapy because of side effects. One year after initiation of therapy, 81% of <tx1_a>interferon</tx1_a> recipients and 20% of those given the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> remained tumor free. Noduloulcerative and superficial lesions were equally responsive to treatment with <tx1_a>interferon</tx1_a>. For some patients with noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas, intralesional <tx1_a>interferon alfa-2b</tx1_a> may be an alternative, effective treatment.

Abstract 150 of 500

A 12-week placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate imipramine as a treatment for cocaine abuse, and to examine whether its effect may be limited to subgroups defined by route of use or by diagnosis of depression. One-hundred thirteen patients were randomized, stratified by route of use and depression. All patients received weekly individual counseling. Compared to placebo the imipramine group showed greater reductions in cocaine craving, cocaine euphoria, and depression, but the effect of imipramine on cocaine use was less clear. A favorable response, defined as at least 3 consecutive, urine-confirmed, cocaine-free weeks was achieved by 19% (11/59) of patients on imipramine compared to 7% (4/54) on placebo (P < 0.09). The imipramine effect was greater among nasal users--33% (9/27) response on imipramine vs. 5% (1/22) on placebo (P < 0.02). Response was also more frequent, but not significantly so, among depressed users on imipramine (26%, 10/38) than on placebo (13%, 4/31) (P < 0.19). Response rates were low in intravenous and freebase users and those without depression. Considered together with the literature on desipramine, these data suggest tricyclic antidepressants are not promising as a mainstay of treatment for unselected cocaine abusers. However, tricyclics may be useful for selected cocaine abusers with comorbid depression or intranasal use, or in conjunction with a more potent psychosocial intervention.

<tx1>Azithromycin (total dose 1.5 g)</tx1> given orally in five or six doses over 5 days was compared with <tx2>erythromycin</tx2> and <tx3>cloxacillin</tx3> both given orally as 500 mg four times daily for 7 days in two multicentre studies of patients with skin and associated soft-tissue infections. <tx1_a>Azithromycin</tx1_a> eradicated baseline pathogen(s), mainly Staphylococcus aureus, in 89% compared with in 78%, of <tx2_a>erythromycin</tx2_a>-treated patients (P = 0.501) and in 78% compared with in 59% of <tx3_a>cloxacillin</tx3_a>-treated patients (P = 0.421). No statistically significant difference in clinical cure was reported between <tx1_a>azithromycin</tx1_a> (74%) and <tx2_a>erythromycin</tx2_a> (75%, P = 1.00) and between <tx1_a>azithromycin</tx1_a> (60%) and <tx3_a>cloxacillin</tx3_a> (47%, P = 0.301) treatment groups. The side-effects reported for <tx1_a>azithromycin</tx1_a> were mainly mild or moderate gastro-intestinal complaints and there were no major abnormalities in laboratory parameters. It is concluded that <tx1_a>azithromycin</tx1_a> was as effective as, but better tolerated than, either <tx2_a>erythromycin</tx2_a> or <tx3_a>cloxacillin</tx3_a> and short-course therapy may improve patient compliance.

Abstract 152 of 500

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of <tx1>low-dose sotalol (a class III antiarrhythmic beta-blocking agent)</tx1> in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs) and to identify predictors for the occurrence of these arrhythmias shortly after coronary artery bypass grafting, <n>300</n> consecutive patients were randomized in a double-blind, <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled fashion. Patients with severely depressed left ventricular function or other contraindications for beta blockers were excluded. Beginning at 4 hours and up to the sixth day after surgery, <n1>150</n1> patients received <tx1_a>40 mg of sotalol</tx1_a> every 6 hours. SVT was observed in 24 (16%) of <n1_a>150</n1_a> <tx1_a>low-dose sotalol</tx1_a>-and in 49 (33%) of <n2>150</n2> <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-treated patients [p less than 0.005]. In patients receiving <tx1_a>sotalol</tx1_a>, atrial fibrillation was the only noted tachyarrhythmia, whereas in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group, 42 (28%) patients had atrial fibrillation, 3 (2%) atrial flutter, 1 (0.7%) atrial tachycardia and 3 (2%) sinus tachycardia. Drug-related adverse effects necessitating discontinuation of the drug were noted in only 2 (1%) <tx1_a>sotalol</tx1_a>-treated patients and 4 (3%) <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-treated patients (p = not significant). For both groups, univariate analysis indicated that older age, 1- or 2-vessel coronary artery disease, long bypass (greater than or equal to 150 minutes) and aorta cross-clamp time (greater than or equal to 120 minutes) were predictive variables for the occurrence of SVTs. Multivariate analysis showed that male sex (odds ratio 2.3), 1- or 2-vessel coronary artery disease (odds ratio 2.0) and older age (odds ratio 1.1) were independent risk factors for increased occurrence of postoperative SVT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract 153 of 500

Aspirin is commonly used to treat migraine attacks, although sumatriptan, a much more expensive treatment, is also effective. We compared a combination of lysine acetylsalicylate (equivalent to 900 mg aspirin) and 10 mg metoclopramide (LAS+MTC) with oral sumatriptan (100 mg) and placebo in 421 patients with migraine. LAS+MTC was as effective as sumatriptan with a decrease of headache from severe or moderate to mild or none of 57% and 53%, respectively, for the first migraine attack treated. Both treatments were better than placebo (success rate 24%, p < 0.0001). LAS+MTC was significantly more effective in the treatment of nausea than sumatriptan (p < 0.0001) and was better tolerated (adverse events in 18% and 28%, respectively, p < 0.05). LAS+MTC is as effective as sumatriptan in the treatment of migraine attacks. It is also much cheaper.

Abstract 154 of 500

<tx1_a>Inhaled corticosteroids</tx1_a> are effective in the treatment of children with asthma. It is uncertain how <tx1-a>inhaled corticosteroids</tx1_a> compare with <tx2_a>oral corticosteroids</tx2_a> in the management of severe acute disease. We performed a double-blind, randomized trial involving <n>100</n> children five years of age or older who had severe acute asthma (indicated by a forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] that was less than 60 percent of the predicted value) and in whom the results could be evaluated. All were treated with an <tx>aggressive bronchodilator regimen</tx> and received one dose of either <tx1>2 mg of inhaled fluticasone through a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer</tx1> or <tx2>2 mg of oral prednisone per kilogram of body weight</tx2>. They were assessed hourly for up to four hours. The mean (+/-SD) base-line FEV1 as a percentage of the predicted value was 46.3+/-12.5 in the <tx1_a>fluticasone</tx1_a> group (<n1>51</n1> subjects) and 43.9+/-9.9 in the <tx2_a>prednisone</tx2_a> group (<n2>49</n2> subjects). The FEV1 increased by a mean of 9.4+/-12.5 percentage points in the <tx1_a>fluticasone</tx1_a> group and by 18.9+/-9.8 percentage points in the <tx2_a>prednisone</tx2_a> group four hours after therapy (P< 0.001). None of the children in the <tx2_a>prednisone</tx2_a> group had a reduction in FEV1 as a percentage of the predicted value from base line to four hours, as compared with 25 percent of those in the <tx1_a>fluticasone</tx1_a> group (P<0.001). Sixteen (31 percent) of the children treated with <tx1_a>fluticasone</tx1_a> were hospitalized, as compared with five (10 percent) of those treated with <tx2_a>prednisone</tx2_a> (P=0.01). Children with severe acute asthma should be treated with oral <tx2_a>prednisone</tx2_a> and not with <tx1_a>inhaled fluticasone</tx1_a> or a similar inhaled corticosteroid.

Abstract 155 of 500

To examine the efficacy of <tx1_a><tx3_a>albuterol</tx1_a></tx3_a> (0.15 mg/kg per dose) in the management of bronchiolitis. Randomized, double-blind, <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>-controlled outpatient clinical trial utilizing four study groups: <tx1>neubulized albuterol</tx1>, <tx2>nebulized saline</tx2>, <tx3>oral albuterol</tx3>, and <tx4>oral placebo</tx4>. Pediatric emergency department and outpatient clinic at University of Maryland in Baltimore. <n>Eighty-eight</n> infants (median age 5.5 months) being treated for their first episode of wheezing were randomly assigned to <tx1_a>nebulized albuterol</tx1_a> (n = <n1>22</n1>), <tx2_a>nebulized saline<tx2_a> (n = <n2>23</n2>), <tx3_a>oral albuterol</tx3_a> (n = <n3>19</n3>), <tx4_a>oral placebo</tx4_a> (n = <n4>24</n4>). The <tx1_a><tx2_a>nebulized</tx1_a></tx2_a> groups received two nebulizations 30 minutes apart, whereas the <tx3_a><tx4_a>oral</tx3_a></tx4_a> groups received one oral dose. Respiratory and heart rates, clinical score, oxygen saturation (Spo2), and the infant's state, ie, asleep, awake, or feeding, were recorded at baseline and at 30 and 60 minutes after treatment. Randomization produced equivalent groups in terms of demographics and baseline measures. There were no statistically significant differences in any outcomes among the four treatments, except for <tx3_a>oral albuterol</tx3_a>, which produced an increase in heart rate (15 beats per minute, P = .005). No differences in the need for additional treatment or hospitalization were observed. Change in the state of the infant during the trial had significant effects on respiratory rate and clinical score. <tx1_a><tx3_a>Albuterol</tx1_a></tx3_a> is as effective as <tx4_a>oral placebo</tx4_a> in the management of bronchiolitis. Past studies supporting the use of <tx1_a><tx3_a>albuterol</tx1_a></tx3_a> did not control for effects of change in state of the infant and did not use a truly inactive <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> group. This study underscores the importance of these design components in measuring the efficacy of <tx1_a><tx3_a>albuterol</tx1_a></tx3_a> in infants.

Abstract 156 of 500

Two hundred twenty-three patients were randomly selected to receive propranolol, 10 mg orally every 6 hours, or to serve as controls after coronary artery bypass grafting. The study began at the time of discharge from the intensive care unit. Patients were ineligible if they had cardiac arrhythmias while in the intensive care unit, low cardiac output requiring catecholamine support, or bradycardia requiring a pacemaker. In the control group, cardiac arrhythmias for which treatment was necessary developed in 31 of 136 patients (23%), atrial fibrillation or flutter in 24 patients (18%), and ventricular arrhythmias in 7 (5%). In the group receiving propranolol, cardiac arrhythmias requiring treatment developed in 9 of 87 patients (10%), atrial fibrillation or flutter in 7 (8%), and ventricular arrhythmias in 2 (2%). The difference in frequency with which cardiac arrhythmias occurred between the two groups is significantly different (p less than 0.05). We conclude that propranolol is effective in the prevention of cardiac arrhythmias following coronary artery bypass grafting.

The most effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to prevent mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in pregnancy and its efficacy during breast-feeding are unknown. We randomly assigned <n>560</n> HIV-1-infected pregnant women (CD4+ count, > or = 200 cells per cubic millimeter) to receive <tx1>coformulated abacavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine (the nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor [NRTI] group)</tx1> or <tx2>lopinavir-ritonavir plus zidovudine-lamivudine (the protease-inhibitor group)</tx2> from 26 to 34 weeks' gestation through planned weaning by 6 months post partum. A total of <n3>170</n3> women with CD4+ counts of less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter received <tx3>nevirapine plus zidovudine-lamivudine</tx3> (the observational group). Infants received single-dose nevirapine and 4 weeks of zidovudine. The rate of virologic suppression to less than 400 copies per milliliter was high and did not differ significantly among the three groups at delivery (96% in the <tx1_a>NRTI</tx1_a> group, 93% in the <tx2_a>protease-inhibitor</tx2_a> group, and 94% in the observational group) or throughout the breast-feeding period (92% in the <tx1_a>NRTI</tx1_a> group, 93% in the <tx2_a>protease-inhibitor</tx2_a> group, and 95% in the observational group). By 6 months of age, 8 of 709 live-born infants (1.1%) were infected (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5 to 2.2): 6 were infected in utero (4 in the <tx1_a>NRTI</tx1_a> group, 1 in the <tx2_a>protease-inhibitor</tx2_a> group, and 1 in the observational group), and 2 were infected during the breast-feeding period (in the <tx1_a>NRTI</tx1_a> group). Treatment-limiting adverse events occurred in 2% of women in the <tx1_a>NRTI</tx1_a> group, 2% of women in the <tx2_a>protease-inhibitor</tx2_a> group, and 11% of women in the observational group. All regimens of HAART from pregnancy through 6 months post partum resulted in high rates of virologic suppression, with an overall rate of mother-to-child transmission of 1.1%.

Abstract 158 of 500

A prospective, randomized, nonblinded clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate whether <tx1>local intraarticular lidocaine injection (IAL)</tx1> is equally effective in facilitating reduction of acute anterior shoulder dislocations (AASD) as <tx2>intravenous analgesia/sedation (IVAS)</tx2>. The setting was an urban, Level 1, trauma center. Patients enrolled presented to the emergency department (ED) with radiographically confirmed AASD and were randomized either to the <tx1_a>IVAS</tx1_a> group or the <tx2_a>IAL</tx2_a> group. Ease of reduction and pain associated with reduction were measured subjectively using a 10-point scale. There were <n>49</n> patients entered into the study, <n1>20</n1> in the <tx1_a>IVAS</tx1_a> group and <n2>29</n2> in the <tx2_a>IAL</tx2_a> group. There was no statistically significant difference between mean +/- SD pain scores of 3.32+/-2.39 in the <tx1_a>IVAS</tx1_a> group and 4.90+/-2.34 in the <tx2_a>IAL</tx2_a> group (P = .18), or mean +/- SD ease of reduction scores of 3.32+/-2.36 in the <tx1_a>IVAS</tx1_a> group and 4.45+/-2.46 in the IAL group (P = .12). Although <tx1_a>IVAS</tx1_a> tended to have a higher success rate (20 of 20) than <tx2_a>IAL</tx2_a> (25 of 29) in this study, Kaplan-Meier estimates for delayed time-events curves applying the log-rank test showed that this difference was not statistically significant overall (P = .16). However, with reduction rate evaluated as a function of time delay in seeking treatment, patients presenting 5.5 hours after dislocation were more likely to fail treatment with <tx2_a>IAL</tx2_a> (P = .00001). Additionally, half of the patients in the <tx2_a>IAL</tx2_a> group who had experience with <tx1_a>IVAS</tx1_a> did not favor <tx2_a>IAL</tx2_a>. Emergency physicians should be aware of <tx2_a>IAL</tx2_a> as an alternative technique that may be considered in patients when there are reasons to avoid systemic analgesia or sedation.

Abstract 159 of 500

This study aimed to compare the efficacy of ultrasound treatment to local corticosteroid injection plus splinting in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). There is still limited knowledge on the efficacy of conservative treatment options for CTS. Fourty-nine hands of 34 patients with CTS were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to the ultrasound treatment (group A) or local corticosteroid injection plus splinting (group B). The primary outcome measures included clinical parameters such as symptoms severity score, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain, functional status score, grip strength and two-point discrimination. The secondary outcome measures were the electrophysiological tests. The examinations were performed at baseline, and then at 4th and 8th weeks. At the end of the study, a statistically significant improvement was obtained in all clinical parameters in the group B: VAS pain, severity of symptoms, functional status, grip strength (p < 0.001 for each) and two-point discrimination (p < 0.016). Also the group A showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters (p < 0.001 for each), except for the grip strength. Additionally, significant improvements in the median nerve sensory conduction velocity and distal motor latency were also found in both groups at the end of the 8 week follow-up period. There was no significant difference between the groups in the primary and secondary outcome measures, except for the grip strength. Both ultrasound treatment and corticosteroid injection plus splinting were effective on the clinical symptoms and the electrophysiological findings of CTS. Thus, the ultrasound therapy may be an alternative treatment for CTS, particularly in patient who do not accept injection or splinting (Tab. 3, Fig. 2, Ref. 36).

Abstract 160 of 500

The efficacy of medications, consisting of serotonin partial and specific reuptake blockers, and <tx2_a>behavior therapy</tx2_a>, consisting of exposure and response prevention in addition to social skills training, cognitive therapy, and habit reversal, in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder are well documented. The purpose of the study was to explore if adding <tx2_a>behavior therapy</tx2_a> to medication would enhance treatment efficacy. <n>Ten</n> children/adolescents who had not previously responded to behavior therapy were randomly assigned to two groups: <tx><tx1>fluvoxamine</tx1></tx> alone or <tx2>fluvoxamine with behavior therapy</tx2>. All 10 patients received <tx_a><tx1_a>fluvoxamine</tx1_a></tx_a> for 10 weeks-<n1>five</n1> continued solely on <tx_a><tx1_a>fluvoxamine</tx1_a></tx_a> for one year and <n2>five</n2> engaged in <tx2_a>behavior therapy</tx2_a> for 20 sessions along with <tx_a><tx1_a>fluvoxamine</tx1_a></tx_a> and then continued solely on medication until the end of the year. Eight of 10 patients improved significantly on <tx_a><tx1_a>fluvoxamine</tx1_a></tx_a> at week 10 on the primary outcome variable, the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). According to the other measurements-National Institute of Mental Health-Global Obses-sive-Compulsive Scale, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (assessing level of im-provement from week to week), and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness Scale (as-sessing how ill the patient is from week to week)-improvement was not as evident. According to the CY-BOCS, those who received a combination of <tx_a><tx1_a>fluvoxamine</tx1_a></tx_a> and exposure with response prevention showed significantly more improvement than those who only took medication. At two-year follow-up, all patients continued to improve, with those in the combined approach improving more than those in the medication-alone group. Future studies should determine the specific effect of each treatment group, combined and singularly. Reasons for discrepancy in improvement ratings as noted by the different instruments are discussed. The addition of <tx2_a>behavior therapy</tx2_a> to <tx_a><tx1_a>fluvoxamine</tx1_a></tx_a> seems to enhance treatment efficacy, according to the CY-BOCS.

Abstract 161 of 500

To investigate the efficacy and possible side effects of <tx1_a>Methotrexate (MTX)</tx1_a> treatment in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. A total of <n>51</n> patients with a diagnosis of AS according to NewYork criteria were randomly distributed into 2 groups. In Group I (n = <n1>25</n1>) only <tx><tx2>Naproxen (1000 mg/day)</tx2></tx> and in Group II (n = <n2>26</n2>) <tx1>oral MTX (7.5 mg/week) combined with Naproxen</tx1> were given for 12 months. The patients were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months after the start of the treatment according to a number of clinical parameters using objective and subjective variables. Data were analysed using ki-square and Mann-Whitney U tests. The comparison of the values using the percent changes and difference scores with respect to pretreatment values showed significant improvement in the "global evaluation of the physician" in Group II compared to Group I while no other parameter was found to be significantly different between the two groups. Those results have led us to conclude that a combination of <tx1_a>MTX</tx1_a> with <tx_a><tx2_a>Naproxen</tx2_a></tx_a> did not prove to be superior to <tx_a><tx2_a>Naproxen</tx2_a></tx_a>-alone treatment in terms of statistical significance. Further trials with <tx1_a>MTX</tx1_a> employing larger doses and different patient populations, mainly comprised of peripheral arthritis are necessary for delineation of the role of <tx1_a>MTX</tx1_a> in AS treatment.

Abstract 162 of 500

We compared ondansetron with droperidol, given prophylactically, in a randomized, prospective, double-blind study of women undergoing outpatient gynecologic laparoscopy. One-hundred fifty-eight women received either ondansetron (4 mg) or droperidol (20 micrograms/kg) intravenously during induction of anesthesia. Nausea was measured at three intervals: at admission to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), 1 h after admission to the PACU, and on Postoperative Day 1. The incidence of vomiting was tabulated in the PACU and on Postoperative Day 1. Sedation was assessed 1 h after admission to the PACU. No differences in nausea, sedation, or number of patients vomiting in the PACU were found. More patients in the ondansetron group reported vomiting on Postoperative Day 1 than subjects in the droperidol group (25 vs 11). No difference in opiate use was found among patients who vomited. We conclude that droperidol is equivalent to ondansetron for the prophylactic treatment of nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy, and that significant cost savings can be appreciated if droperidol is used. Implications: Either ondansetron or droperidol, frequently used antiemetics, was given to women before they underwent gynecologic laparoscopy. No difference in the number of women experiencing postoperative nausea and vomiting or their level of sedation was found. Equivalent effectiveness and significant cost-savings may be obtained by using droperidol prophylactically for laparoscopic surgery.

Abstract 163 of 500

Safe, simple and cost-effective protocol is an important goal in ART cycles. The aim of this prospective study was whether administration of low-dose hCG in late follicular phase can be used clinically to replace gonadotropin administration in GnRH long protocol. <n>122</n> patients who were candidates for ART enrolled the study and randomly divided into two groups. The control group (n = <n1>62</n1>) received <tx1>standard long protocol and gonadotropin administration continued until the day of hCG injection (10,000 IU) for final follicular maturation</tx1>. The study group (n = <n2>60</n2>) received <tx2>GnRH long protocol and when at least ≥6 follicles with mean diameter ≥12 mm were observed in both ovaries, hMG was displaced by 200 IU per day of hCG until final follicular maturation</tx2>. There were no significant differences in age, basal FSH, infertility duration and infertility etiology between two groups. There were no statistically significant differences between two groups regarding chemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, and abortion per cycle (50, 40, 40, and 20 % in study group vs. 45.2, 35.5, 35.5, and 21.4 % in control group, respectively). Mean dose of used gonadotropins was significantly higher in control group than that in the study group (2,524 ± 893 IU in control group and 1,439 ± 433 IU in study group) (p = 0.000). According to our data, we recommend the use of <tx2_a>low-dose hCG in GnRH long protocol</tx2_a> because of lower doses of used gonadotropins.

Abstract 164 of 500

The role of <tx1_a>vancomycin</tx1_a> and other antibiotics in the treatment of acute peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients is well established. However, the role of preoperative <tx1_a>vancomycin</tx1_a> or cephalosporins in preventing early infection in newly placed PD catheters remains controversial. We performed a prospective randomized study to examine the role of <tx1_a>vancomycin</tx1_a> or <tx2_a>cefazolin</tx2_a> prophylaxis in decreasing the incidence of postoperative peritonitis. Over a 6-year period, <n>221</n> patients undergoing 254 permanent peritoneal catheter placement procedures were randomized into three groups. Group I patients (86 procedures) were administered <tx1>a single intravenous (IV) dose of vancomycin, 1,000 mg, 12 hours before peritoneal catheter placement procedures</tx1>, whereas group II patients (85 procedures) were administered <tx2>a single IV dose of cefazolin, 1,000 mg, 3 hours before the procedure</tx2>. Group III patients (83 procedures) were <tx3>not administered antibiotics preoperatively for at least 1 week before the procedure</tx3>. Patients were monitored for peritonitis in the following 14 days. Peritonitis developed in 1 patient (1%) in group I (<tx1_a>vancomycin</tx1_a> group) and 6 patients (7%) in group II (<tx2_a>cefazolin</tx2_a> group) compared with 10 patients (12%) in group III (control group); P = 0.02. We conclude that the use of preoperative single-dose IV <tx1_a>vancomycin</tx1_a> prophylaxis for permanent PD catheter placement reduces the risk for postoperative peritonitis. Single-dose <tx1_a>vancomycin</tx1_a> is superior to single-dose <tx2_a>cefazolin</tx2_a> in reducing the risk for postoperative peritonitis. Absence of prophylaxis is associated with a high risk for developing postoperative peritonitis.

Abstract 165 of 500

A new mesalazine rectal gel preparation (without propellant gas) has been recently developed to improve topical treatment in distal ulcerative colitis. To evaluate the efficacy, safety and patient tolerability of mesalazine gel enema compared with mesalazine foam enema in the treatment of patients with acute left-sided ulcerative colitis. In a randomized multicentre investigator-blind parallel group trial, 103 patients with mild to moderate left-sided colitis or proctosigmoiditis were randomly allocated to mesalazine 2 g gel enema (n = 50 evaluable patients) and mesalazine 2 g foam enema (n = 53 evaluable patients) for 4 weeks. Clinical symptoms, endoscopic and histological findings were assessed at entry, 2 and 4 weeks. Patients' evaluation of treatment tolerability and acceptability was assessed at 2 and 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, clinical remission was achieved by 76% of mesalazine gel enema-treated patients and 69% of patients treated with mesalazine foam enema (P = 0.608). Endoscopic remission rates at week 4 were 51 and 52% for the mesalazine gel and foam enemas, respectively (P = 0.925). Histological remission was achieved by 30% of patients in both groups. Patients reported that the new mesalazine gel preparation was significantly better tolerated than the foam enema. Patients in the foam group had significantly more difficulty in retention (25% vs. 6%, P < 0.05), abdominal bloating (50% vs. 26%, P < 0.005) and discomfort during administration (48% vs. 26%, P < 0.05). The new mesalazine gel enema is efficacious and significantly better tolerated than the mesalazine foam enema.

<n>Fifty-one</n> adult male outpatients at or below ideal body weight (IBW) with no history of weighing more than 15% over IBW in the past 5 yr and no more than 25% in the past 15 yr were randomly assigned to a <tx1>traditional calorically defined exchange-type diet (EXCH)</tx1> or an <tx2>unmeasured diet emphasizing avoidance of refined sugar and balance of food consumption throughout the day</tx2>. All but 4 patients were insulin treated. With the exception of one patient in each group, all patients were classified as having type II diabetes. Subjects were followed in a single-blind design for 4 yr in the Diabetes Outpatient Clinic every 3 mo. The average mean fasting glycemia (FBS), coefficient of FBS variation, number of reported hypoglycemic reactions, mean fasting serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and mean total daily insulin dosage were similar in both groups. Each patient's mean daily caloric intake did vary over time, but there was no difference in mean caloric intake between diet groups. There was a significant correlation between a patient's mean FBS rating and his serum triglyceride level: patients with lower mean FBS had a significantly lower mean triglyceride level than patients with higher FBS. Overall body weights remained stable throughout the study. However, there was a significant difference in the number of patients in the <tx1_a>EXCH</tx1_a> group whose actual weight was 3% or more above IBW on 50% or more of their visits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract 167 of 500

<n>Eight hundred twelve</n> men with presumed acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular filling pressure of at least 12 mm Hg participated in a randomized double-blind <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a <tx1>48-hour infusion of sodium nitroprusside</tx1>. The mortality rates at 21 days (10.4 per cent in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group and 11.5 per cent in the <tx1_a>nitroprusside</tx1_a> group) and at 13 weeks (19.0 per cent and 17.0 per cent, respectively) were not significantly affected by treatment. The efficacy of <tx1_a>nitroprusside</tx1_a> was related to the time of treatment: the drug had a deleterious effect in patients whose infusions were started within nine hours of the onset of pain (mortality at 13 weeks, 24.2 per cent vs. 12.7 per cent; P = 0.025) and a beneficial effect in those whose infusions were begun later (mortality at 13 weeks, 14.4 per cent vs. 22.3 per cent; P = 0.04). <tx1_a>Nitroprusside</tx1_a> should probably not be used routinely in patients with high left ventricular filling pressures after acute myocardial infarction. However, the results in the patients given late treatment suggest that those with persistent pump failure might receive sustained benefit from short-term <tx1_a>nitroprusside</tx1_a> therapy.

Abstract 168 of 500

Methodology to evaluate the efficacy of antitussive drugs rely largely on subjective methods and cough counts. There are few studies in cough due to natural disease especially using objective techniques. This paper presents data from a series of randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trials in cough due to both chronic bronchopulmonary disease and acute upper respiratory tract infections. In these studies, cough was quantified using a standardized and validated computerized system for the acquisition and multidimensional analysis of the cough sound. Key objective parameters like cough counts, intensity, latency and total effort expended were studied. Guaiphenesin and bromhexine showed significant expectorant effects in patients with productive cough due to chronic bronchopulmonary disease. Differences were observed in speed of action, and objective and subjective measures, that probably indicate differences in drug action. More recently, three studies evaluated the antitussive drug dextromethorphan in non-productive cough due to uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections. Reproducible cough suppressant effects were demonstrated after a single 30 mg dose using objective measures of cough counts, latency and total effort. These results establish the sensitivity and robustness of the cough quantitation methodology in the objective evaluation of cough treatments.

Abstract 169 of 500

In chronic hepatitis C the schedule of <tx1><tx2><tx>interferon (IFN)</tx></tx2>, 3 MU thrice weekly (tiw) plus ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/daily)</tx1> needs further evaluation, as <tx_a>IFN</tx_a> dosages >3 MU achieve better responses. To compare the efficacy of <tx1_a>5 MU tiw of IFN with</tx1_a> (<n1>96</n1> patients) or <tx2_a>without ribavirin</tx2_a> (<n2>96</n2> patients) for 12 months in naïve patients, to evaluate the effect of baseline features on the response to therapy, and to determine a reliable point in time during treatment to predict non-response. Sustained virologic response was 20.8% (95% CI 13-29) with <tx2_a><tx_a>IFN</tx_a> monotherapy</tx2_a> and 54.2% (95% CI 44-64) with <tx1_a>combination</tx1_a> (P = 0.0001), the relapse rate 39.4% (95% CI 23-56) and 9% (95% CI 1-16) (P = 0.0007), and the combined rate of sustained biochemical and virologic response 22.7% (95% CI 14-31) and 60.5% (95% CI 50-71) (P = 0.0001), respectively. Patients given <tx1_a>combination therapy</tx1_a> were more likely to respond regardless of baseline features. Apart from genotype non-1, predictive factors for <tx2_a><tx_a>IFN</tx_a> monotherapy</tx2_a> were ineffective in predicting response to <tx1_a>combination therapy</tx1_a>. Using logistic regression analysis, <tx1_a><tx_a>IFN</tx_a>-ribavirin</tx1_a> was the strongest predictor of response (X2 = 21.3; P = 0.0001). Viral persistence at month 3 of therapy was a more accurate predictor than aminotransferase values for non-response to <tx2_a><tx_a>IFN</tx_a> monotherapy</tx2_a> but not to combination therapy (positive predictive values of 98 and 82%, respectively). In this study, <tx1_a>5 MU of <tx_a>IFN</tx_a> combined with a standard dose of ribavirin</tx1_a> has yielded the highest rate of sustained response reported to date. Further dose finding studies are warranted.

Abstract 170 of 500

Post-operative nausea and vomiting is distressing for patients and can cause dissatisfaction and impaired well-being in the post-operative period. This study examined the question whether the reduced incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting inevitably translates into improved clinical status and well-being. In this context high doses of <tx1_a>droperidol</tx1_a> were investigated. On the one hand, <tx1_a>droperidol</tx1_a> is known to be a powerful anti-emetic, but on the other hand there is concern about psychological effects, both in the pre- and the post-operative period. In this prospective randomized double-blinded study, <tx1>droperidol (5-7.5 mg)</tx1> was compared with <tx2>midazolam (5-7.5 mg)</tx2> used to supplement <tx>fentanyl-N2O based anaesthesia</tx>, with respect to post-operative mood and well-being using a psychological questionnaire (Bf-S-test). Furthermore, the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting was recorded. Out of 160 patients undergoing thyroidectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, data from <n>150</n> patients were analysed. The administration of <tx1_a>droperidol</tx1_a> significantly lowered the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting from 77.8% to 55.1% compared with <tx2_a>midazolam</tx2_a> (P = 0.0059; chi 2-test). Although post-operative nausea and vomiting is an independent risk factor for post-operative discomfort and bad mood, patients receiving <tx1_a>droperidol</tx1_a> showed impaired well-being 6 h after surgery. Well-being scores returned to pre-operative base-line values and did not differ between the two groups 24 and 48 h post-operatively. The reduced incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting achieved with high dose <tx1_a>droperidol</tx1_a> does not equate with increased post-operative well-being. It is an important point at issue to decide whether smaller doses of <tx1_a>droperidol</tx1_a> that are commonly used for anti-emetic therapy are free of these side effects.

Abstract 171 of 500

We tested the usefulness of aspirin (325 mg twice daily), heparin (1000 units per hour by intravenous infusion), and a combination of the two in the early management of acute unstable angina pectoris in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 479 patients. The patients entered the study as soon as possible after hospital admission (at a mean [+/- SD] of 7.9 +/- 8.0 hours after the last episode of pain), and the study was ended after 6 +/- 3 days, when definitive therapy had been selected. Major end points--refractory angina, myocardial infarction, and death--occurred in 23, 12, and 1.7 percent of the 118 patients receiving placebo, respectively. Heparin was associated with a decrease in the occurrence of refractory angina (P = 0.002). The incidence of myocardial infarction was significantly reduced in the groups receiving aspirin (3 percent; P = 0.01), heparin (0.8 percent; P less than 0.001), and aspirin plus heparin (1.6 percent, P = 0.003), and no deaths occurred in these groups. There were too few deaths overall to permit evaluation of the effect of treatment on this end point. The combination of aspirin and heparin had no greater protective effect than heparin alone but was associated with slightly more serious bleeding (3.3 vs. 1.7 percent). We conclude that in the acute phase of unstable angina, either aspirin or heparin treatment is associated with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction, and there is a trend favoring heparin over aspirin. Heparin treatment is also associated with a reduced incidence of refractory angina.

Abstract 172 of 500

Infarct expansion starts within hours to days after transmural myocardial injury. Previous echocardiographic and left ventriculographic studies demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy limits left ventricular dilatation, particularly in patients with anterior wall acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or impaired left ventricular function. <n>Forty-three</n> patients with an acute Q-wave AMI were randomized within 24 hours of symptom onset to <tx1>intravenous enalaprilat (1 mg)</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2>. Patients were then given corresponding <tx>oral therapy</tx> and followed for 1 month. Predrug and 1-month gated blood pool scans were obtained in 32 patients to evaluate changes in cardiac volumes and ejection fraction. Twenty-three patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 1 month to evaluate left ventricular infarct expansion. Blood pressure decreased at 6 hours but returned to baseline in both groups after 1 month of therapy. The change in cardiac volumes from baseline to 1 month differed between the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> (end-diastolic volume +16 +/- 5 ml, end-systolic volume +8 +/- 6 ml), and <tx1_a>enalapril</tx1_a> (end-diastolic volume -8 +/- 9 ml and end-systolic volume -14 +/- 7 ml) groups (p < 0.05 vs placebo). Global and infarct zone ejection fractions improved significantly at 1 month in the <tx1_a>enalapril</tx1_a> group (+6 +/- 3% and 19 +/- 5%, respectively) but did not change over 1 month in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group. Infarct segment length and infarct expansion index by magnetic resonance imaging were significantly less in those treated with <tx1_a>enalapril</tx1_a>, suggesting less infarct expansion in this group. Thus, early administration of <tx1_a>enalaprilat</tx1_a> to patients presenting with a first Q-wave AMI prevents cardiac dilatation and infarct expansion.

To compare the efficacies of <tx2_a>meperidine</tx2_a> and <tx1_a>hydromorphone</tx1_a> in the treatment for ureteral colic in the emergency department (ED). A prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted over six months at a tertiary referral center with 93,000 annual ED visits. <n>Seventy-three</n> patients completed the study. The patients received either <tx1>1 mg of hydromorphone</tx1> or <tx2>50 mg of meperidine IV</tx2> at t = 0. Pain intensity was determined using a 10-cm visual analog scale at t = 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. A second dose of the study drug could be given between t = 15 and t = 120 minutes when the clinician believed the initial dose was ineffective. Patients requiring more than one additional dose of analgesia were treated as nonresponders and were removed from the study. <n1>Thirty-six</n1> patients received <tx1_a>hydromorphone</tx1_a> and <n2>37</n2> received <tx2_a>meperidine</tx2_a>. The initial pain intensities (<tx1_a>hydromorphone</tx1_a> group = 8.4 +/- 1.5; <tx2_a>meperidine</tx2_a> group = 8.5 +/- 2.1), age distributions, sex distributions, and side effects of the two groups were comparable. Pain relief was better (p < 0.05) with <tx1_a>hydromorphone</tx1_a> at t = 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. The <tx1_a>hydromorphone</tx1_a> group required rescue analgesia less often (31% vs 68%, p < 0.01), had fewer IV pyelographies (IVPs) (28% vs 54%, p < 0.05), and had a lower proportion of hospital admissions (25% vs 49%, p = 0.08). For the fixed doses used in this study, the adult ureteral colic patients receiving <tx1_a>hydromorphone</tx1_a> achieved more pain relief, required less rescue medication, underwent fewer IVPs, and avoided hospital admission more frequently than did those receiving <tx2_a>meperidine</tx2_a>.

Abstract 174 of 500

To determine whether the use of verbal descriptors suggested by the European Union (EU) such as "common" (1-10% frequency) and "rare" (0.01-0.1%) effectively conveys the level of risk of side effects to people taking a medicine. Randomised controlled study with unconcealed allocation. 120 adults taking simvastatin or atorvastatin after cardiac surgery or myocardial infarction. Cardiac rehabilitation clinics at two hospitals in Leeds, UK. A written statement about one of the side effects of the medicine (either constipation or pancreatitis). Within each side effect condition half the patients were given the information in verbal form and half in numerical form (for constipation, "common" or 2.5%; for pancreatitis, "rare" or 0.04%). The estimated likelihood of the side effect occurring. Other outcome measures related to the perceived severity of the side effect, its risk to health, and its effect on decisions about whether to take the medicine. The mean likelihood estimate given for the constipation side effect was 34.2% in the verbal group and 8.1% in the numerical group; for pancreatitis it was 18% in the verbal group and 2.1% in the numerical group. The verbal descriptors were associated with more negative perceptions of the medicine than their equivalent numerical descriptors. Patients want and need understandable information about medicines and their risks and benefits. This is essential if they are to become partners in medicine taking. The use of verbal descriptors to improve the level of information about side effect risk leads to overestimation of the level of harm and may lead patients to make inappropriate decisions about whether or not they take the medicine.

Abstract 175 of 500

Bile duct perfusion with corticosteroids is reported to improve the cholangiographic and biochemical abnormalities in some patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. In a randomised <tx2>placebo</tx2> controlled trial, <n>thirteen</n> consecutive patients received <tx>continuous bile duct irrigation</tx> with either <tx1>normal saline (1 l/day)</tx1> or <tx2>normal saline plus hydrocortisone (100 mg daily) via a nasobiliary tube placed in a hepatic duct at endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography</tx2>. Eleven patients completed lavage for 2 weeks but no cholangiographic changes were observed in either group. Liver function tests deteriorated during lavage, but later returned to pre-treatment levels. Although bile was sterile at start of lavage, a wide range of bacteria was isolated from bile in all patients during treatment, and cholangitis with septicaemia occurred in 2 patients. We conclude that <tx2_a>nasobiliary lavage</tx2_a> is not beneficial in treating primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Abstract 176 of 500

To confirm the reported lack of major gastrointestinal side effects of <tx1>naproxen</tx1>, we gave <n>58</n> patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and significant gastrointestinal disease therapeutic doses of <tx1_a>naproxen</tx1_a> while closely monitoring them for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction. All patients underwent upper gastrointestinal x-ray examinations at the start of the trail, and, when indicated, during the course of the study. Endoscopies were also performed when indicated. Forty patients had hiatus hernia and 35 had peptic ulcer (23 duodenal ulcer and 12 gastric ulcer). Twenty-six patients had a combination of hiatus hernia with either type of peptic ulcer. After 262 patient visits over a period of 52 weeks, 35 patients remained in the study, all having had more than six months of <tx1_a>naproxen</tx1_a> therapy in dosages ranging from 500 to 750 mg daily. In 33 of the 35, the response to <tx1_a>naproxen</tx1_a> had generally been good to excellent. Only seven patients dropped out of the trial because of complaints referable to side effects. There were no major related upper gastrointestinal side effects as monitored by continuing clinical evaluation, stool occult blood, comprehensive laboratory examination, and, where indicated, upper gastrointestinal x-ray studies. Approximately 70 per cent of the patients demonstrated efficacy on long-term <tx1_a>naproxen</tx1_a> therapy by subjective and objective parameters. <tx1_a>Naproxen</tx1_a> appears to be an efficacious and remarkably safe drug in the long-term therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, even in the presence of significant upper gastrointestinal symptomatology.

Abstract 177 of 500

To evaluate whether selective digestive decontamination (SDD) reduces mortality from any cause, and the incidence of pneumonia among patients with severe burns. SDD is a prophylactic strategy to reduce infectious morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Two meta-analyses and a recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated a mortality reduction varying between 20% and 40%. But this technique has never been properly evaluated in severely burned patients. The design of this single-center trial was randomized, double blind, placebo controlled. Patients with burns > or =20% of total body surface and/or suspected inhalation injury were enrolled and assigned to receive SDD or placebo for the total duration of treatment in the burn intensive care unit (ICU). One hundred seventeen patients were randomized and 107 were analyzed (53 in the SDD group and 54 in the placebo group). The ICU mortality was 27.8% in the placebo group and 9.4% in the SDD group in the burn ICU. Treatment with SDD was associated with a significant reduction in mortality both in the burn ICU (risk ratio 0.25; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76) and in the hospital (risk ratio 0.28; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.80), following adjustment for predicted mortality. The incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in the placebo group: 30.8 and 17.0 pneumonias per 1000 ventilation days (P = 0.03) in placebo and SDD group, respectively. Treatment with SDD reduces mortality and pneumonia incidence in patients with severe burns.

To determine whether there is a difference in the quality of life between elderly patients <tx1>managed in a day hospital</tx1> and those receiving <tx2>conventional care</tx2>. Randomized controlled trial; assessment upon entry to study and at 3, 6 and 12 months afterward. Geriatrician referral-based secondary care. A total of <n>113</n> consecutively referred elderly patients with deteriorating functional status believed to have rehabilitation potential; <n1>55</n1> were <tx1_a>assessed and treated by an interdisciplinary team in a day hospital</tx1_a> (treatment group), and <n2>58</n2> were <tx2_a>assessed in an inpatient unit or an outpatient clinic or were discharged early with appropriate community services</tx2_a> (control group). Barthel Index, Rand Questionnaire, Global Health Question and Geriatric Quality of Life Questionnaire (GQLQ). Eight study subjects and four control subjects died; the difference was insignificant. Functional status deteriorated over time in the two groups; although the difference was not significant there was less deterioration in the control group. The GQLQ scores indicated no significant difference between the two groups in the ability to perform daily living activities and in the alleviation of symptoms over time but did show a trend favouring the control group. The GQLQ scores did indicate a significant difference in favour of the control group in the effect of treatment on emotions (p = 0.009). The <tx1_a>care received at the day hospital</tx1_a> did not improve functional status or quality of life of elderly patients as compared with the otherwise excellent <tx2_a>geriatric outpatient care</tx2_a>.

Abstract 179 of 500

To determine which of three different approaches increased women's understanding of risk of pregnancy associated with different contraceptive methods. We randomly assigned <n>461</n> reproductive-age women to one of three tables presenting pregnancy risk (<tx1>Food and Drug Administration table with numbers</tx1>, <tx2>World Health Organization table with numbers and categories</tx2>, or <tx3>table with categories</tx3>). We evaluated participant knowledge before and after being shown the assigned table. The most important reason for choosing a contraceptive was how well it works (53%), followed by ease of use (13%), and protection against sexually transmitted disease or human immunodeficiency virus (11%). Before looking at the tables, about half the participants knew that hormone shots are more effective than pills (48%) and that pills are more effective than condoms (57%). For these two key comparisons, the <tx3_a>category table</tx3_a> compared to the <tx1_a>Food and Drug Administration table</tx1_a> with numbers improved knowledge significantly more (37% versus 20% and 27% versus 14%; both P <.05). Compared with those assigned to the <tx1_a>Food and Drug Administration table with numbers</tx1_a>, significantly fewer participants assigned to the <tx3_a>category table</tx3_a> said the table was difficult to read (6% versus 19%; P <.01). Most participants in all three groups said their assigned table provided enough information to choose a contraceptive method. The table with categories communicated relative contraceptive effectiveness better than the tables with numbers. However, without being presented with numbers, participants grossly overestimated the absolute risk of pregnancy using contraceptives. A combination of categories and a general range of risk for each category may provide the most accurate understanding of both relative and absolute pregnancy risk.

Abstract 180 of 500

In 1995 a meta-analysis of randomised trials investigating the value of adding chemotherapy to primary treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) suggested a small survival benefit for cisplatin-based chemotherapy in each of the primary treatment settings. However, the meta-analysis included many small trials and trials with differing eligibility criteria and chemotherapy regimens. The aim of the Big Lung Trial was to confirm the survival benefits seen in the meta-analysis and to assess quality of life and cost in the supportive care setting. A total of 725 patients were randomised to receive supportive care alone (n = 361) or supportive care plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy (n = 364). 65% of patients allocated chemotherapy (C) received all three cycles of treatment and a further 27% received one or two cycles. 74% of patients allocated no chemotherapy (NoC) received thoracic radiotherapy compared with 47% of the C group. Patients allocated C had a significantly better survival than those allocated NoC: HR 0.77 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.89, p = 0.0006), median survival 8.0 months for the C group v 5.7 months for the NoC group, a difference of 9 weeks. There were 19 (5%) treatment related deaths in the C group. There was no evidence that any subgroup benefited more or less from chemotherapy. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of the pre-defined primary and secondary quality of life end points, although large negative effects of chemotherapy were ruled out. The regimens used proved to be cost effective, the extra cost of chemotherapy being offset by longer survival. The survival benefit seen in this trial was entirely consistent with the NSCLC meta-analysis and subsequent similarly designed large trials. The information on quality of life and cost should enable patients and their clinicians to make more informed treatment choices.

Abstract 182 of 500

Our purpose was to investigate the efficacy of postsurgical treatment with <tx1_a>nafarelin</tx1_a> in women with advanced endometriosis. Eligible for trial were women < or = 38 years old with unexplained infertility with or without chronic pelvic pain and stage III or IV endometriosis according to the American Fertility Society, revised, classification who underwent laparotomy as first surgical treatment for debulking or radical surgery of endometriotic lesions. Patients were assigned according to a randomization list to <tx1>nasal nafarelin, 400 micrograms/day</tx1> (<n1>36</n1> subjects) or <tx2>placebo nasal spray</tx2> (<n2>39</n2> subjects) for 3 months. Pelvic pain was assessed before first surgery and at the 12-month follow-up visit in women with pelvic pain by means of a multidimensional score system and a 10-point linear pain scale. No marked differences in pain scores emerged among women allocated to different treatments. The mean reduction of the multidimensional score was 3.6 and 4.0, respectively, in women allocated to <tx1_a>nafarelin</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> and of the 10-point linear scale scores was 7.0 and 6.9. These differences were not statistically significant. Within 1 year from randomization, of the 36 women allocated to <tx1_a>nafarelin</tx1_a> and the 39 allocated to <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>, seven (19%) and seven (18%), respectively, became pregnant. This study suggests that medical treatment with <tx1_a>nafarelin</tx1_a> does not markedly improve pelvic pain and short-term reproductive prognosis in women with stages III and IV endometriosis.

Abstract 183 of 500

Major depression is a common psychiatric disorder in the elderly population. The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants is well established, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear to have a similar effectiveness along with advantages in terms of tolerability and safety. Given the lack of literature data regarding fluvoxamine in the treatment of depressed elderly patients, the aim of the present study was to compare its efficacy and tolerability with those of sertraline in a sample of elderly patients. Under double-blind conditions, 93 hospitalized patients older than 59 years, who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for a major depressive episode, were randomly assigned to receive sertraline (150 mg daily) or fluvoxamine (200 mg daily) for 7 weeks. The clinical response was defined as a reduction on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score to 8 or below. At study completion, the response rates were 55.6% (25/45) and 71.8% (28/39) for sertraline and fluvoxamine, respectively. No significant difference in final response rates was found between the 2 treatment groups (P = 0.12). A repeated-measures analysis of variance on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores revealed a significantly different decrease of depressive symptoms between the 2 treatment groups, favoring fluvoxamine (P = 0.007). The overall safety profile of sertraline and fluvoxamine was favorable with no differences between the 2 drugs. The results of this double-blind trial show that sertraline and fluvoxamine may be effective compounds in the treatment of elderly depression with the latter showing some advantage in terms of speed of response. These findings warrant further replication in placebo-controlled studies.

Abstract 184 of 500

Two treatment strategies were compared in <n>155</n> women with pregnancy-induced hypertension who were also given comprehensive non-pharmacological care. The mean gestation at entry was 28 weeks. As long as the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) remained below 106 mmHg, <tx1>oxprenolol, or oxprenolol plus dihydralazine</tx1>, were given to the early treatment group, and matching <tx2>placebos</tx2> to the control group. Open antihypertensive treatment was provided for patients whose DBP rose above 105 mmHg. Proteinuria occurred in seven women in each group. In the early treatment group, 13 of the <n1>78</n1> women were delivered by caesarean section; the corresponding numbers in the control group were 27 of <n3>76</n3> (17 vs 36%, 95% confidence interval (CI) of difference: 5-33%); the sections included seven and 16 in the early treatment and control groups, respectively, for severe hypertension and/or fetal distress. There were five perinatal deaths, two in the early treatment group and three in the control group. Early treatment did not influence gestational age at birth or birthweight. Respiratory distress syndrome occurred in four infants in the early treated group and in 10 in the control group; 14 infants in the former group and 26 in the latter were in hospital for more than 10 days (18 vs 35%; 95% CI of difference 4-32%). These results indicate that <tx1_a>early antihypertensive treatment with oxprenolol</tx1_a> is safe for the fetus and newborn in pregnancy-induced hypertension, but has no advantage over non-pharmacological care in terms of fetal growth. However, it may prevent acute hypertension in late pregnancy and associated fetal distress, and thus reduce the number of caesarean sections.

Abstract 185 of 500

Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of aortoiliac and femoropopliteal atherosclerotic lesions can provide long-lasting hemodynamic improvement. High-dose aspirin is commonly prescribed as reocclusion prophylaxis, but low doses would be preferable because of fewer adverse effects. We performed a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial in patients with peripheral vascular disease with lesions appropriate for angioplasty. We compared the efficacy and side effects of two doses of <tx>aspirin</tx> (<tx1_a>50 mg</tx1_a> vs. <tx2_a>900 mg</tx2_a> daily) during a period of 12 months after angioplasty. A total of <n>359</n> patients were evaluated: <n1>175</n1> were randomly assigned to treatment with <tx2>900 mg aspirin daily</tx2> and <n2>184</n2> to <tx1>50 mg aspirin daily</tx1>. Thirty-nine patients developed restenosis at the angioplasty site; the cumulative percentage of event-free survival after 1 year (patency rate) was 85% in <tx2_a>900 mg</tx2_a> group and 84% in <tx1_a>50 mg</tx1_a> group. An equivalence test showed the two groups equivalent with respect to restenosis rates (P = 0.0003 for an equivalence region of < 10% difference. Nine patients (5%) in the <tx2_a>900 mg</tx2_a> group had serious gastrointestinal side effects (peptic ulcer, 8; erosive gastritis requiring transfusion, 1) compared to two ( peptic ulcer) in the <tx1_a>50 mg</tx1_a> group (P = 0.03). The results of our study show that a dose of <tx1_a>50 mg aspirin a day</tx1_a> is as effective as <tx2_a>900 mg</tx2_a> for the prevention of restenoses after lower limb angioplasty, and that severe gastrointestinal side effects are less frequent.

Abstract 186 of 500

The effect of antibiotic therapy in sore throat is questionable and this dilemma has been complicated by the emergence of multiple resistant strains of micro-organisms. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken in patients aged 4-60 years to assess the efficacy of penicillin V on the clinical course and bacteriological response in patients with sore throat in general practice. Two hundred and thirty-nine patients presenting with an acute sore throat to 37 general practices in the Netherlands who were clinically suspected of group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were randomized for treatment with penicillin V (n = 121) or placebo (n = 118). Resolution of sore throat, fever and return to daily activities were evaluated by the general practitioner 2 days after the start of treatment and by the patients keeping a diary for 7 days. The result of throat culture after 2 days was evaluated. A difference in resolution of sore throat was present after 2 days in all patients, but was a result of GABHS-positive patients (n = 111; 46%) in favour of those randomized for penicillin V (adjusted odds ratio 5.3; 95% CI 1.9-15.1). An effect in the course of fever was also seen in GABHS-positive patients (adjusted odds ratio 5.3; 95% CI 1.02-27.7). A difference of 1-2 days was seen in clinical recovery. No difference was found in daily activities between the treatment groups. After 2 days, 4% of the penicillin-treated patients harboured GABHS compared with 75% of the placebo group. Only GABHS-positive patients benefit from penicillin V in their clinical cure in the first few days. Therefore, rapid testing is necessary. Treatment may be beneficial with regard to the clinical course, but it is not necessary.

Abstract 187 of 500

This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance <tx1_a>oral nifedipine</tx1_a> in patients initially treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate for preterm labor. Patients with a diagnosis of preterm labor between 24 and 33.9 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to receive either <tx1>maintenance tocolytic therapy with oral nifedipine (20 mg every 4-6 hours)</tx1> or <tx2>no treatment</tx2> (control) after discontinuation of magnesium tocolysis. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were evaluated. A sample size of 50 patients was required to detect a 10-day difference in mean time gained (beta =.2, alpha =.05). Statistical analyses were based on intent to treat. The t, chi(2), and Fisher exact tests were performed. <n>Seventy-four</n> patients were randomly assigned to receive either <tx1_a>oral nifedipine</tx1_a> (n = <n1>37</n1>) or <tx2_a>no treatment</tx2_a> (n = <n2>37</n2>). There were no statistically significant differences in age, race, parity, preterm delivery risk factors, enrollment gestational age, results of cervical examination, delivery gestational age, time gained, or neonatal complications between the groups. Delivery gestational age (mean +/- SD) was 35.4 +/- 3.2 weeks for patients randomly assigned to receive <tx1_a>nifedipine</tx1_a> and 35.3 +/- 3.2 weeks for patients who received <tx2_a>no treatment</tx2_a> (P =.9). Time gained during pregnancy was 37 +/- 23.9 days in the <tx1_a>nifedipine</tx1_a> group and 32.8 +/- 20.4 days in the control group (P =.4). Maintenance therapy with <tx1_a>oral nifedipine</tx1_a> does not significantly prolong pregnancy in patients initially treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate for preterm labor.

Abstract 188 of 500

Concurrent potent therapy of hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV includes at least five antiviral drugs. Drug interactions, toxicity, tolerance and acceptance by patients of such treatment regimens are unknown. A prospective open randomized pilot trial was conducted to test <tx1>interferon-alpha (6 million units/day for the 1st month followed by 6 million thrice weekly) and amantadine</tx1> versus <tx2>interferon-alpha monotherapy</tx2> for tolerability and feasibility among HIV and HCV co-infected patients on stable antiretroviral combination therapy. <n>1,013</n> HIV-infected patients were consecutively evaluated. 314 were anti-HCV antibody positive; only eight (2.4%) were eligible. Major reasons for exclusion were: normal transaminase levels (34%), ongoing intravenous drug use (33%), or recent change in antiretroviral therapy (31%). Study drugs were stopped in all of the seven patients enrolled because of side effects and/or failure of anti-HCV therapy. CD4 lymphocyte counts and HIV-1 RNA remained stable. Among patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy, the addition of <tx1_a>interferon-alpha with or without amantadine</tx1_a> was inefficient and poorly tolerated, but had no negative influence on HIV infection. Eligibility for the study was unexpectedly low.

Abstract 190 of 500

The need for increasing operating room efficiency has led to various initiatives, one of which is the elimination of mandatory admission to the phase I recovery area postoperatively, also referred to as fast tracking of ambulatory surgery patients. This Institutional Review Board-approved study was conducted to evaluate the effect of <tx1>Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring</tx1> on the ability of patients to successfully bypass the phase I recovery area following gynecologic laparoscopy during general anesthesia. <n>Ninety-nine</n> consenting patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: group one, in which the <tx1_a>BIS monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Natick, MA)</tx1_a> was used, and group two, in which <tx2>no BIS monitor</tx2> was used. All patients received a <tx>standardized anesthetic that included 1 microg/kg sufentanil and sevoflurane in oxygen</tx>, titrated in group one to a <tx1_a>BIS</tx1_a> value of 50-60 and in group two to maintain vital signs within 20% of preoperative values. All patients received <tx>prophylactic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and antiemetics</tx>. Postoperatively, patients were evaluated using the modified Aldrete scoring system, and those who achieved a score of 9 or higher within 10 min were permitted to bypass the phase I recovery area. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to the number of patients who successfully bypassed the phase I recovery area, postoperative length of hospital stay, or cost of hospitalization. With a standardized anesthetic regimen and a strict discharge scoring system, <tx1_a>BIS monitoring</tx1_a> does not have a significant effect on the ability to fast track outpatients.

Preoperative administration of methylprednisolone sodium succinate can control surgical stress in patients undergoing hepatic resection. A prospective randomized trial. A university hospital department of surgery. <n>Thirty-three</n> patients who underwent hepatic resection were classified into 2 groups: a <tx1>control</tx1> group (n = <n1>16</n1>) and a steroid group (n = <n2>17</n2>) in which patients were intravenously administered <tx2>500 mg of methylprednisolone 2 hours before surgery</tx2>. Perioperative levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 (serum and peritoneal), immunosuppressive acidic protein, Candida antigen, and other laboratory and clinical variables were measured. Postoperative levels of serum and peritoneal IL-6 and levels of C-reactive protein were significantly lower in the <tx2_a>steroid</tx2_a> group than in <tx1_a>controls</tx1_a>. Furthermore, serum and peritoneal IL-10 levels were significantly higher in the <tx2_a>steroid</tx2_a> group. The total bilirubin value on postoperative day 1 was significantly lower in the <tx2_a>steroid</tx2_a> group than in <tx1_a>controls</tx1_a>. Postoperative immunosuppressive acidic protein levels were also significantly lower in the <tx2_a>steroid</tx2_a> group, as was the positive rate of serum Candida antigen. No differences were found in the incidence of postoperative complications. Preoperative steroid administration significantly elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels, suppressed the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and C-reactive protein, and prevented postoperative elevation of total bilirubin values. Furthermore, postoperative elevation of immunosuppressive acidic protein levels and the positive rate of Candida antigen were suppressed, indicating that the immune response was maintained by preoperative <tx2_a>steroid</tx2_a> administration.

Abstract 192 of 500

This randomized, double-blind trial compared the efficacy of nebulized epinephrine with salbutamol in the treatment of infants with acute bronchiolitis. The mean percent oxygen saturation at 60 minutes was significantly higher in the epinephrine group. Thirty-three percent of the patients in epinephrine group were admitted to the hospital compared with 81% of the salbutamol group (p = 0.003). We conclude that nebulized epinephrine is more efficacious than salbutamol for infants with acute bronchiolitis seen in an emergency department.

Abstract 193 of 500

The current study was undertaken to determine if blood loss at the time of cesarean section is affected by method of placental removal (spontaneous versus extracted) or uterine position for repair (in situ versus exteriorized). This prospective randomized study involved <n>100</n> women who were undergoing a cesarean section. The patients were placed into one of four groups--1, <tx1>spontaneous placenta detachment, in situ uterine repair</tx1>; 2, <tx2>spontaneous placental detachment, exteriorized uterine repair</tx2>; 3, <tx3>manual placental removal, in situ uterine repair</tx3>, and 4, <tx4>manual placental removal, exteriorized uterine repair</tx4>. Patients with <tx1_a><tx2_a>spontaneous placental separation</tx1_a></tx2_a> (groups 1 and 2) compared with <tx3_a><tx4_a>manual removal</tx3_a></tx4_a> (groups 3 and 4) revealed a significant decrease in blood loss (p < 0.001). Uterine position did not significantly affect blood loss in the <tx1_a><tx2_a>spontaneous</tx1_a></tx2_a> group (1 and 2; p = 0.971) or the <tx3_a><tx4_a>manual placental removal</tx3_a></tx4_a> groups (3 and 4; p = 0.061). The hematocrit values for all groups were similar preoperatively, but postoperatively, were significantly lower in the <tx3_a><tx4_a>manual removal</tx3_a></tx4_a> groups when compared with the <tx1_a><tx2_a>spontaneous</tx1_a></tx2_a> placental separation groups (p < 0.001). The method of placental removal and not the position of the uterus at the time of its repair has a significant role in blood loss during cesarean birth.

Abstract 194 of 500

Uncontrolled studies suggest that high-dose chemotherapy is beneficial in patients with breast cancer and multiple metastases to the axillary lymph nodes. Many physicians accept this treatment as standard care. We aimed to assess adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy in breast cancer in a phase II randomised trial. <n>97</n> women aged younger than 60 years, who had breast cancer with extensive axillary-node metastases (confirmed by a tumour-positive infraclavicular lymph-node biopsy), received <tx_a>three courses of up-front chemotherapy (FE120C)</tx_a>. This regimen consisted of <tx>cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 120 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 once weekly for 3 weeks</tx>. After surgery, stable patients or those who responded to chemotherapy were randomly assigned <tx1>conventional therapy (fourth course of FE120C, followed by radiation therapy and 2 years of tamoxifen</tx1> [<n1>40</n1> patients]) or <tx2>high-dose therapy (identical treatment but an additional high-dose regimen and peripheral-blood progenitor-cell [PBPC] support after the fourth FE120C course</tx2> [<n2>41</n2> patients]). This <tx2_a>high-dose regimen comprised cyclophosphamide 6 g/m2, thiotepa 480 mg/m2, and carboplatin 1600 mg/m2</tx2_a>. The primary endpoint was overall and disease-free survival. All analyses were by intention to treat. No patients died from toxic effects of chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 49 (range 21-76) months, the 4-year overall and relapse-free survivals for all <n_a>97</n_a> patients were 75% and 54%, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival between the patients on <tx1_a>conventional therapy</tx1_a> and those on <tx2_a>high-dose therapy</tx2_a>. <tx2_a>High-dose therapy</tx2_a> is associated with substantial cost and acute toxic effects, but also has potentially irreversible long-term effects. Until the benefit of this therapy is substantiated by large-scale phase III trials, <tx2_a>high-dose chemotherapy</tx2_a> should not be used in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, apart from in randomised studies.

Abstract 195 of 500

In a patient with longstanding severe uraemic pruritus who was undergoing chronic haemodialysis cholestyramine caused the pruritus to disappear completely within a few days. A four-week randomised controlled double-blind study was therefore performed in 10 other patients with uraemic pruritus who were on chronic haemodialysis. The pruritus improved considerably in four of the five treated patients, whereas only one of those treated with placebo experienced relief. The patient who had no relief while on cholestyramine showed a considerable improvement when the dose subsequently doubled. One of the five patients receiving cholestyramine experienced mild and easily reversible constipation, and another suffered nausea. Neither of these complications prevented the patients from continuing treatment. Cholestyramine seems to be useful in treating uraemic pruritus, although it is not known how it acts.

Abstract 196 of 500

Dimenhydrinate and metoclopramide are inexpensive antiemetic drugs. Metoclopramide, especially, has been studied extensively in the past, but there are no studies on the combination of both drugs for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). <n>One hundred and sixty</n> male inpatients undergoing endonasal surgery were randomized to receive one of four antiemetic regimens in a double-blind manner: <tx1>placebo</tx2>, <tx2>1 mg x kg(-1) dimenhydrinate</tx2>, <tx3>0.3 mg x kg(-1) metoclopramide</tx3>, or <tx4>the combination of both drugs</tx4> was administered after induction of anesthesia. Patients received a second dose of these drugs six hours after the first administration to mitigate their short half-life. Standardized general anesthesia included benzodiazepine premedication, propofol, desflurane in N2O/O2 vecuronium, and a continuous infusion of remifentanil. Postoperative analgesia and antiemetic rescue medication were standardized. Episodes of vomiting, retching, nausea, and the need for additional antiemetics were recorded for 24 hr. The incidences of PONV were analyzed with Fisher's Exact test and the severity of PONV (rated by a standardized scoring algorithm) with the Jonckheere-Terpestra-test. The incidence of patients free from PONV was 62.5% in the <tx1_a>placebo</tx1_a>-group and increased to 72.5% in the <tx2_a>metoclopramide</tx2_a>-group (P = 0.54), 75.0% in the <tx3_a>dimenhydrinate</tx3_a>-group (P = 0.34), and 85.0% in the <tx4_a>combination</tx4_a>- group (P = 0.025). In the latter group, the severity of PONV was reduced compared with <tx1_a>placebo</tx1_a> treatment (P = 0.017; Jonckheere-Terpestra-test). <tx2_a>Dimenhydrinate</tx2_a> and <tx3_a>metoclopramide</tx3_a> were ineffective in reducing the incidence and the severity of PONV. Their <tx4_a>combination</tx4_a> reduced the incidence of PONV compared with <tx1_a>placebo</tx1_a>.

Abstract 197 of 500

We tested the hypothesis that <tx1_a>recombinant human deoxyribonuclease 1 (rhDNase)</tx1_a> reduces airflow obstruction and improves mucociliary clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and that improvements seen in FEV1 and FVC after <tx1_a>rhDNase</tx1_a> treatment are independent of chest physical therapy (CPT). CF patients inhaled <tx2>placebo</tx2> (<n2>10</n2> patients) or <tx1>2.5 mg rhDNAse aerosol</tx1> (<n1>10</n1> patients) twice a day for six consecutive days. Compared with baseline, there were no statistically significant differences between the two study groups by Day 6 for indices of airflow obstruction obtained from gamma-camera images of the right lung following inhalation of 99mTc aerosol, or for mucociliary clearance or the rate of clearance of the radioaerosol, quantified over a 6-h period. By Day 6, FEV1 and FVC were significantly higher in the <tx1_a>rhDNase</tx1_a>-treated group than in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group, increasing by an average of 9.4 +/- 3.5% and 12.7 +/- 2.6%, respectively, as compared with a decrease of 1.8 +/- 1.7% and an increase of 0.4 +/- 1.1%, respectively (p < 0.05). There was no significant change in the FEV1/FVC ratio on Day 6 (0.68 +/- 0.05) compared with baseline (0.70 +/- 0.05) in the <tx1_a>rhDNase</tx1_a> group. On Day 6, FEV1 and FVC decreased after CPT in both study groups, but the decreases were not significant. Our results indicate that <tx1_a>aerosolized rhDNase</tx1_a> improves FEV1 and FVC independent of CPT. We were unable to demonstrate that <tx1_a>rhDNase</tx1_a> reduces airflow obstruction or improves mucociliary clearance.

Abstract 198 of 500

Fifty dysfunctional central venous catheters proven radiographically to be occluded by thrombus were blindly randomized to be injected with either 2 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) or 10,000 units of urokinase (UK) and allowed to incubate for 2 h. A second dose was allowed if catheter function was not restored with the first injection. Repeat radiograph contrast injection was done when catheter function was restored or after 2 doses of study drug were administered, whichever occurred first. Thirteen of 22 catheters randomized to UK had full function restored compared to 25 of 28 randomized to t-PA (p = 0.013). Radiographic contrast injection showed 7 catheters randomized to UK had complete resolution of the thrombus compared to 17 randomized to t-PA (p = 0.042). Four catheters randomized to UK had complete resolution of the thrombus after a single dose compared to 13 randomized to t-PA (p = 0.036). A novel dose of 2 mg of t-PA restored catheter function more reliably and dissolved thrombi faster than twice the standard, FDA-approved dose of UK.

Abstract 199 of 500

<tx1>Nomifensine</tx1>, <tx2>imipramine</tx2>, and <tx3>placebo</tx3> were compared in <n>61</n> depressed geriatric outpatients over a 35-day period. At average daily doses of 150 mg, <tx1_a>nomifensine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>imipramine</tx2_a> were significantly more effective than <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a> in reducing symptoms of depression in this sample of elderly depressed patients. <tx1_a>Nomifensine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>imipramine</tx2_a> were generally comparable in clinical effect; 78% of the <tx1_a>nomifensine</tx1_a>-treated patients were rated as improved at the end of treatment as compared with 64% of <tx2_a>imipramine</tx2_a> and 20% of <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a> patients. The findings suggest a more favorable side effect profile for <tx1_a>nomifensine</tx1_a>, which was associated with a lower frequency of sedating and anticholinergic effects than was seen in the <tx2_a>imipramine</tx2_a> group.

Abstract 200 of 500

A positive family history of coronary heart disease alone confers an increased risk, which may be affected by untreated hypercholesterolemia. <tx1>Dietary counseling</tx1> is a first-line treatment approach. To determine whether <tx2>nurse counseling</tx2> can provide additional benefits over usual physician efforts to lower dietary fat in high-risk persons, <n>117</n> apparently healthy adult siblings of persons with premature coronary heart disease were <tx2_a>counseled by a registered nurse</tx2_a> using adapted national guidelines. Reductions in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol were significantly greater in the nurse group compared to those in the usual care group. Total fat intake decreased by 14 g in the <tx2_a>nurse</tx2_a> group, compared with an increase of 5 g in the <tx1_a>usual care</tx1_a> group (p=0.0001). Assignment to the <tx2_a>nurse</tx2_a> group was also a significant predictor of a greater reduction in the percentage of total fat calories (p=0.008). The authors conclude that a registered <tx2_a>nurse</tx2_a> may serve as a complement to <tx1_a>usual care</tx1_a> in efforts to lower dietary fat and cholesterol in high-risk families.

Abstract 201 of 500

The authors designed a randomized, double-blind, crossover study to assess the efficacy of sertraline in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) when given only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Thirty-one subjects were selected for a 7-month study period that included an initial 2 months of screening, 2 months of treatment with placebo or sertraline, 1 washout month, and 2 months of crossover treatment with either placebo or sertraline. Eleven subjects completed the study. Symptoms were monitored with daily reports using the Calendar of Premenstrual Experience (COPE). For each study phase, premenstrual COPE scores (7 days prior to menses) were examined using repeated measures analysis of variance. Scores were logarithmically transformed. Comparison of baseline scores between the luteal and follicular phases was examined using the paired t test. Analysis of COPE results during the treatment periods of the luteal phase showed a significant treatment effect, with higher scores during the placebo cycles compared with the sertraline-treated cycles (p = .0052 behavioral, p = .014 physical). This study is the first to demonstrate a significant response to a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor used only during the luteal phase. The authors point out the importance of this finding both in terms of economic cost of patients as well as how it may add to the growing understanding of the etiology of PMDD.

Abstract 202 of 500

Three tight regimens to maintain blood sugar values of 5.6 SI (group A), 5.6-6.7 SI (group B), and 6.7-8.9 SI (group C), were studied in 60 pregnant diabetic patients. The perinatal salvage rate was 96.6%. Maternal hypoglycaemia occurred only in group A. The group C regimen produced more complications than occurred in the other 2 groups. Very tight control of blood sugar is not necessary for successful management of diabetes in pregnancy and blood sugar value between 5.6-6.7 SI offers the best outcome.

Abstract 203 of 500

We performed a randomized phase III multicenter study to compare systemic treatment versus no treatment after complete excision and radiotherapy for isolated first locoregional recurrence in patients with breast cancer. One hundred sixty-seven good-risk patients with an estrogen receptor (ER+) positive recurrence or, in case of unknown receptor status, a disease-free interval (DFI) of greater than 12 months and < or = three recurrent tumor nodules each < or = 3 cm in diameter were entered onto the study. They were randomized to observation subsequent to local treatment or to receive tamoxifen (TAM) until disease progression. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were postmenopausal. The median observation period for the entire study population was 6.3 years. The median disease-free survival (DFS) duration was 26 months for observation and 82 months for TAM patients (P = .007). This was mainly due to the reduction of further local recurrences, whereas the occurrence of early distant metastases was delayed. A multivariate analysis identified DFI and treatment with TAM as significant prognostic factors for DFS. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 76% and 74%, respectively (P = .77). DFI was also a prognostic factor for OS. Systemic therapy with TAM after isolated locoregional recurrence of breast cancer significantly increased 5-year DFS rates from 36% to 59% compared with observation alone and prolonged median DFS by more than 4.5 years in patients with ER+ tumors or in the case of unknown ER status with a DFI of greater than 12 months and minimal tumor burden. Treatment with TAM currently has no significant impact on OS, but the median survival duration of the study population has not yet been reached.

Abstract 204 of 500

To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of galantamine, using a slow dose escalation schedule of up to 8 weeks, in 978 patients with mild to moderate AD. A 5-month multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Following a 4-week placebo run-in, patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: placebo or galantamine escalated to final maintenance doses of 8, 16, or 24 mg/day. Outcome measures included the cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus), the AD Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living inventory, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Standard safety evaluations and adverse event monitoring were carried out. After 5 months, the galantamine-placebo differences on ADAS-cog were 3.3 points for the 16 mg/day group and 3.6 points for the 24 mg/day group (p < 0.001 versus placebo, both doses). Compared with placebo, the galantamine 16- and 24-mg/day groups also had a significantly better outcome on CIBIC-plus, activities of daily living, and behavioral symptoms. Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events were low in all galantamine groups (6 to 10%) and comparable with the discontinuation rate in the placebo group (7%). The incidence of adverse events in the galantamine groups, notably gastrointestinal symptoms, was low and most adverse events were mild. Galantamine 16 and 24 mg/day significantly benefits the cognitive, functional, and behavioral symptoms of AD as compared with placebo. Slow dose escalation appears to enhance the tolerability of galantamine, minimizing the incidence and severity of adverse events.

Abstract 205 of 500

The efficacy of lithium carbonate as a prophylactic drug against depression in bipolar manic depressive patients was assessed through a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients who had histories of recurrent depressions and hypomanias ("bipolar II"). The results revealed that treatment with lithium carbonate resulted in a reduction in the frequency of depressive attacks was observed with lithium carbonate treatment during the study (mean length of study, approximately 16 months), although there was a suggestion that the depressive attacks that occurred during treatment with lithium carbonate might be less severe than with placebo treatment.

Abstract 206 of 500

The results of a clinical trial comparing slow-release 5-aminosalicylic acid tablets (Pentasa) and enteric-coated sulfasalazine tablets (Salazopyrin) with regard to the efficacy of maintaining ulcerative colitis patients in remission for 12 mo and with regard to safety of treatment are reported. Seventy-five patients with ulcerative colitis in remission for between 1 mo and 5 yr were included for analysis. Forty-nine men and 26 women, aged between 18 and 79 yr, received either Pentasa t.i.d. (1500 mg) plus Salazopyrin placebo or Salazopyrin t.i.d. (3 g) plus Pentasa placebo daily. Patients were assessed clinically, endoscopically, and histologically before and 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo after the start of treatment. Life-table analysis showed ongoing remission after 6 and 12 mo for Pentasa to be 63% (26 of 41) and 54% (22 of 41) and for Salazopyrin 72% (22 of 31) and 46% (14 of 31). These differences were not statistically significant. Three patients treated with Salazopyrin were withdrawn because of severe erythrodermia, anxiety and backache, and pregnancy, respectively. One patient on Salazopyrin experienced transient rises in serum urea, creatinine, and lactic dehydrogenase and another patient in this group reported slight reversible loss of hair. In the Pentasa group no side effects were recorded. We conclude that Pentasa is a well-tolerated drug, equally effective as Salazopyrin in maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis.

Abstract 207 of 500

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of simvastatin on plasma lipoproteins and renal function in hypercholesterolaemic Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy. Twenty-six hypercholesterolaemic (total cholesterol greater than or equal to 5.5 mmol/l) Type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy were enrolled in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study for 12 weeks. The active treatment group (n = 14) received simvastatin (10-20 mg/day) for 12 weeks while the remaining 12 patients received treatment with placebo. The results during simvastatin treatment (baseline vs 12 weeks): total cholesterol 6.6 vs 4.8 mmol/l (p less than 0.01), LDL-cholesterol 4.25 vs 2.57 mmol/l (p less than 0.01) and apolipoprotein B 1.37 vs 1.06 mmol/l (p less than 0.01). HDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I remained unchanged. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B remained unchanged during placebo treatment. Albuminuria measured during the simvastatin and the placebo treatment (baseline vs 12 weeks) (the data are logarithmically transformed before analysis because of their positively skewed transformation; geometric mean (x/divided by antilog SE) is indicated) was 458 (x/divided by 1.58) vs 393 (x/divided by 1.61) and 481 (x/divided by 1.62) vs 368 (x/divided by 1.78 micrograms/min (NS). Glomerular filtration rate during simvastatin and placebo treatment (baseline vs 12 weeks) was 64 vs 63 and 72 vs 74 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2, respectively. Two patients receiving simvastatin treatment were withdrawn, one due to gastrointestinal side effects and one due to myalgia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract 209 of 500

To evaluate the additional effect of functional exercises on balance and lower extremity function among hostel-dwelling elderly people partaking in strength,training. A randomized two-group parallel controlled trial. A senior resident's hostel in Switzerland. Thirty-two individuals randomized to either strength or strength and functional exercise groups. Both groups received machine-driven strength training for 45 min, twice weekly, for 12 weeks. The strength and functional exercises group received an additional 30 min of functional exercise training, once weekly. Tinetti test, balance tests and a physical performance test. Assessments were performed before and after the intervention. Improvements for the balance test depended on the type of training (significant interaction effects [F(1,20)= 6.7; P = 0.018]). This test improved from 11.3 +/- 11.7 to 17 +/- 11.2 (P = 0.009) in the combined training group (n = 12) and remained from 7.3 +/- 9.5 to 6.9 +/- 9.2 unchanged (P = 0.821) in the strength training group (n = 13). A significant difference between groups following training was observed (P = 0.031). The Tinetti balance score and the chair stand test of the physical performance assessment improved from 14.3 +/- 1.9 to 15.3 +/- 1.1 (P = 0.026) and 1.8 +/- 1.2 to 2.8 +/- 1.1 (P = 0.012) respectively in the combined training group only. Our findings suggest that twice-weekly lower extremity strength training of 12 weeks' duration in hostel-dwelling elderly people only improves task-specific balance performance and lower extremity physical function when additional functional exercises are added.

Abstract 210 of 500

In singleton gestations, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) has been shown to reduce the rate of recurrent preterm birth. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether 17P would reduce the rate of preterm birth in twin gestations. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 14 centers. Healthy women with twin gestations were assigned to weekly intramuscular injections of 250 mg of 17P or matching placebo, starting at 16 to 20 weeks of gestation and ending at 35 weeks. The primary study outcome was delivery or fetal death before 35 weeks of gestation. Six hundred sixty-one women were randomly assigned to treatment. Baseline demographic data were similar in the two study groups. Six women were lost to follow-up; data from 655 were analyzed (325 in the 17P group and 330 in the placebo group). Delivery or fetal death before 35 weeks occurred in 41.5% of pregnancies in the 17P group and 37.3% of those in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 1.3). The rate of the prespecified composite outcome of serious adverse fetal or neonatal events was 20.2% in the 17P group and 18.0% in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.5). Side effects of the injections were frequent in both groups, occurring in 65.9% and 64.4% of subjects, respectively (P=0.69), but were generally mild and limited to the injection site. Treatment with 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate did not reduce the rate of preterm birth in women with twin gestations. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00099164 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

Abstract 211 of 500

The development of bone metastases depends on tumor-induced osteoclastic resorption of bone, which may be inhibited by the antiosteolytic bisphosphonate clodronate. Given to patients with primary breast cancer, clodronate might reduce the subsequent incidence of bone metastases. This double-blind, multicenter trial accrued 1,069 assessable patients with operable breast cancer between 1989 and 1995. All patients received surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and tamoxifen as required. Patients were randomized to receive oral clodronate 1,600 mg/d or a placebo for 2 years starting within 6 months of primary treatment. The primary end point was relapse in bone, analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis, during the medication period and during the total follow-up period (median follow-up, 2,007 days). Secondary end points were relapse in other sites, mortality, and toxicity. During the total follow-up period, there was a nonsignificant reduction in occurrence of bone metastases (clodronate, n = 63; placebo, n = 80; hazards ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 1.08; P =.127). During the medication period there was a significant reduction in the occurrence of bone metastases (clodronate, n = 12; placebo, n = 28; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.86; P =.016). The occurrence of nonosseous metastases was similar (clodronate, n = 112; placebo, n = 128; P =.257), but there was a significant reduction in mortality (clodronate, n = 98; placebo, n = 129; P =.047) during the total follow-up period. Clodronate, given to patients with primary operable breast cancer, may reduce the occurrence of bone metastases, although this reduction was only significant during this medication period. There was a significant reduction in mortality.

Abstract 212 of 500

Multimodal analgesia may be important for optimal postoperative pain treatment and facilitation of early mobilization and recovery. We investigated the analgesic effect of pregabalin and dexamethasone in combination with paracetamol after abdominal hysterectomy. One hundred and sixteen patients were randomly assigned to either group A (paracetamol+placebo x 2), group B (paracetamol+pregabalin+placebo) or group C (paracetamol+pregabalin+dexamethasone). According to randomization and preoperatively, patients received paracetamol 1000 mg, pregabalin 300 mg, dexamethasone 8 mg or placebo. General anaesthesia was performed. Postoperative pain treatment was paracetamol 1000 mg x 4 and patient-controlled intravenous morphine, 2.5 mg bolus. Nausea was treated with ondansetron. Morphine consumption, pain score (visual analogue scale) at rest and during mobilization, nausea, sedation, dizziness, number of vomits and consumption of ondansetron were recorded 2, 4 and 24 h after the operation. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The 24-h morphine consumption and pain score, both at rest and during mobilization, were not significantly different between treatment groups. The mean nausea score (P=0.002) was reduced in group C vs. A. The number of vomits was significantly reduced in both group B (P=0.041) and C (P=0.001) vs. A. Consumption of ondansetron was reduced in group C vs. A and B (P<0.001). Other side effects were not different between groups. Combinations of paracetamol and pregabalin, or paracetamol, pregabalin and dexamethasone did not reduce morphine consumption and pain score compared with paracetamol alone for patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. Dexamethasone reduced nausea, vomiting and use of ondansetron.

Abstract 213 of 500

The urinary excretion of the norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) was measured in unipolar depressed patients before and during the fourth week of treatment with either imipramine hydrocloride or amitriptyline hydroxhloride. On the basis of strict rating criteria, 24 patients were selected as either unequivocal responders or nonresponders. In the imipramine group the mean pretreatment MHPG was significantly lower in the nine responders in the seven nonresponders; the converse was found with the amitriptyline patients. Of particular interest is that there was no overlap in individual values between the responders and nonresponders to either drug. Treatment with eigher imipramine or amitriptyline was associated with a significant decrease in MHPG excretion, which was independent of clinical response.

Abstract 214 of 500

The impact of oral antimicrobial prophylaxis on the surgical site infection and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after elective colorectal surgery was evaluated by a prospective randomized single-blind study. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either mechanical bowel cleansing with polyethylene glycol alone (group 1) or mechanical cleansing plus oral antimicrobial prophylaxis with kanamycin and erythromycin for 2 days prior to surgery (group 2). In both groups, cefotiam was intravenously given twice a day for 3 days. A total of 143 patients (71 for group 1 and 72 for group 2) were eligible. The incidence of a surgical site infection was 23.9% in group 1 and 11.1% in group 2 (P = 0.04). The incidence of MRSA infection including at surgical and remote sites was 11.1% in group 1 and 5.6% in group 2 (P = 0.19). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of surgical site infection was influenced by the choice of the chemical bowel preparation (P = 0.03) and blood loss (P < 0.01), while an MRSA infection was predominantly influenced by blood loss (P < 0.01) followed by coexisting underlying diseases (P = 0.07). These results suggest that preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis would be useful for reducing the incidence of a surgical site infection without increasing the risk of an MRSA infection following elective colorectal surgery.

Abstract 215 of 500

This study examined the effectiveness of short-term contingency management for eliminating cocaine use and increasing full day treatment attendance with pregnant methadone-maintained women randomly assigned to either an escalating voucher incentive schedule (n=44) or non-incentive (n=36) conditions. Full day treatment attendance and urine toxicology for cocaine and heroin were assessed and consequated for 14 days. The escalating voucher incentive schedule significantly increased full day treatment attendance and drug abstinence compared to the non-incentive schedule. These results suggest that reinforcing the co-occurrence of two required behaviors (treatment attendance and abstinence from illicit drug use) is effective, and may be an important adjunct to methadone pharmacotherapy for treating pregnant drug dependent women.

Abstract 216 of 500

Pharmacokinetic properties and efficacy of a conventional (C) carbamazepine (CBZ) preparation divided into three daily doses and a slow-release CBZ preparation (SR) divided into two daily doses were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The trial started with a 8-week baseline period followed by the two treatment periods each 10 weeks long. At the end of each period, a 24-h blood sample series for determination of serum CBZ and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) was collected. The occurrence of seizures was monitored day and night during the whole study period by experienced nurses. The mean age of the 20 evaluable patients was 24.9 and the duration of epilepsy 19.2 and carbamazepine treatment 7.0 years. The bioavailability of CBZ from the two preparations was similar. The mean fluctuation of serum CBZ concentration (Cmax-Cmin/Css) was 16% smaller during SR. The mean serum CBZ concentration in the morning samples was significantly (P less than 0.001) higher during SR treatment. The mean total number of seizures was approximately four per week and did not differ between the two treatments, but during the last 2 weeks of the study period the occurrence of seizures was significantly smaller during SR (P = 0.02).

Abstract 217 of 500

One hundred and eighty women with a history of recurrent, unexplained spontaneous abortion (mean 3.5 abortions) were randomised to receive oral dydrogesterone (10 mg b.i.d.), intramuscular human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG; 5000 IU every 4 days) or no additional treatment (controls). Treatment was started as soon as possible after confirmation of pregnancy and continued until the 12th gestational week. All women received standard supportive care. Abortions were significantly (p < or = 0.05) less common in the dydrogesterone group (13.4%) than in the control group (29%); there were no statistically significant differences between the hCG group and the control group. There were no differences between the groups with respect to pregnancy complications or congenital abnormalities. In conclusion, hormonal support with dydrogesterone can increase the chances of a successful pregnancy in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion.

Abstract 220 of 500

A double-blind clinical trial of 3% acyclovir (Zovirax) and 3% adenosine arabinoside (ara-A, Vidarabine) in 93 patients with herpetic corneal ulceration is presented. Ulcers in 45 (94%) of acyclovir-treated patients and 37 (82%) ara-A-treated patients healed within 14 days. Patients treated with acyclovir healed more rapidly than those treated with ara-A (p less than 0.01). No serious adverse effects were observed.

Abstract 221 of 500

To identify the minimum effective single oral dose of metronidazole for trichomoniasis. Women attending an inner-city sexually transmitted disease clinic who had Trichomonas vaginalis vaginitis diagnosed by microscopy were recruited for this randomized, double-blind study. Subjects were given a 0.5-, 1-, 1.5-, or 2-g single oral dose of metronidazole, taken under direct observation. Demographic information, symptoms, and clinical findings were collected from patient interviews, and physical examinations were conducted at the time of enrollment and at the follow-up visit. The primary outcome measure was treatment success at the follow-up visit, established by negative culture and microscopy. Three (1.8%) of the 167 women enrolled were excluded because of vomiting after taking metronidazole, and 66 (40%) of the 164 remaining subjects did not return for the follow-up visit. No associations were found between the proportion of subjects lost to follow-up and the characteristics of these subjects across assignment groups. The treatment success ratio was highest in subjects who received the 1.5-g dose (23, 85%), followed by the 2-g (16, 84%), 1-g (18, 62%), and the 0.5-g dose (8, 35%). A single 1.5-g dose of metronidazole has efficacy equivalent to a single 2-g dose for the treatment of T vaginalis vaginitis.

Abstract 222 of 500

We performed a randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of zimelidine with amitriptyline and placebo in outpatients with major depression, in particular patients with mixed anxiety/depressive symptomatology. Overall, amitriptyline was more effective than zimelidine and placebo after 4 weeks of treatment. However, when those patients with more severe depression were specifically examined, both antidepressants were equal in efficacy and superior to placebo. We also found no evidence for a greater likelihood of a zimelidine-induced peripheral neuropathy in this study. The present results suggest that zimelidine may be more effective in the treatment of severely depressed patients, rather than those with more mild mixed anxiety/depressive syndromes.

Abstract 223 of 500

The introduction of the triazole antifungal agent fluconazole, which can be used via an oral route and single dose, has had a significant impact on patient compliance. To compare the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose of 150 mg fluconazole with that of a 100-mg clotrimazole vaginal suppository twice a day in the morning and at bedtime for 3 days in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted at Ramathibodi Hospital between June 1 and September 30, 1993. There were 53 women in the group treated with fluconazole and 50 in the group treated with clotrimazole. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding clinical characteristics (age and length of follow-up period). Mycological cure rates approximately 1 week after treatment were 79.2% in the fluconazole group and 80.0% in the clotrimazole group. Approximately 4 weeks after treatment, these rates were 60.4% and 66.0%, respectively. The side effects were minimal and did not warrant any treatment. The differences in the results were not statistically significant. We recommend that a single oral dose of 150 mg of fluconazole be given as an alternative method of treating vulvovaginal candidiasis, but the cost is higher than for clotrimazole.

Abstract 224 of 500

To study the occurrence of diabetic neuropathy and the effect of insulin treatment in elderly Type 2 diabetic patients. In 38 patients and 20 controls symptoms and neurophysiological examinations including electroneurography, vibration perception and temperature discrimination thresholds were investigated. Patients were randomized to insulin (n = 18) or sulfonylurea (n = 16) treatment and were re-investigated after 1 year. Neuropathy was present in 21/38 patients (56%). It was asymptomatic in 17/38 (45%) and symptomatic in 4/38 (11%). The occurrence of neuropathy was less common in healthy controls, 3/20 (15%) (P < 0.01). Temperature discrimination thresholds was the test that most often revealed pathology. The metabolic control after 1 year was significantly improved in the insulin treated group and unchanged in the sulfonylurea treated group. There were no changes as regards occurrence of neuropathy between or within the two treatment groups after 1 year. Diabetic neuropathy is common among elderly Type 2 diabetic patients. It is mostly asymptomatic. Improvement was not seen after 1 year of insulin treatment.

Abstract 225 of 500

Conventional nebulized beta-agonist therapy has met with disappointing results in an increasing number of moderate to severe asthmatics who may be characterized as "poor responders." Thirty-eight patients suffering from acute exacerbations of moderate to severe asthma were treated in an emergency department with an intravenous infusion of saline placebo or 1.2 g of magnesium sulfate after conventional beta-agonist therapy failed to produce significant improvement in peak expiratory flow rate. Nineteen patients were randomized into each of two groups in a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. The treatment group demonstrated an increase in peak expiratory flow rate from 225 to 297 L/min as compared with 208 to 216 L/min seen in the placebo group. In addition, the number admitted vs discharged was significantly better for the treatment group (7 vs 12) than the placebo group (15 vs 4). Intravenous magnesium sulfate may represent a beneficial adjunct therapy in patients with moderate to severe asthma who show little improvement with beta-agonists.

Abstract 226 of 500

To study the efficacy of intestinal decontamination by oral nonabsorbable antibiotic agents to control a nosocomial outbreak of intestinal colonization and infection with multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae, and to examine its effects on endemic nosocomial infection rates. A 10-week prospective incidence study (group 1), and then an 8-week randomized, open trial of intestinal decontamination (groups 2 and 3). A medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care university hospital. Consecutive patients with unit stay of over 2 days and a severity score at admission of more than 2; 124 patients were included in group 1, 50 in group 2 (control), and 36 in group 3 (intestinal decontamination). Neomycin, polymyxin E, and nalidixic acid were given to group 3 patients throughout their stay in the unit. Intestinal colonization with multiresistant strains occurred in 19.6% of patients in group 1, at a mean of 16 days after admission, and preceded detection in clinical samples by a mean of 11 days. During the decontamination trial, intestinal colonization rates decreased to 10% (group 2), and 3% (group 3) (P = 0.12 and P less than 0.01, compared with group 1, respectively). Corresponding infection rates were 9% (group 1), 3% (group 2), and 0 (group 3). No new cases were detected in the following 4 months. The intestinal colonization rate with gram-positive cocci was higher in group 3 than group 2 (P less than 0.001). The overall rate of nosocomial infections was at 28% (group 1), 33% (group 2), and 32% (group 3). Intestinal decontamination can help to control an outbreak of intestinal colonization and infection with multiresistant gram-negative bacilli in the intensive care unit, but should not be recommended for routine prevention of endemic nosocomial infections.

Abstract 227 of 500

To assess the Vitamin A status of pregnant women in their third trimester using maternal serum retinol levels as the indicator; and (ii) To assess the impact of postpartum Vitamin A supplementation on the Vitamin A status of exclusively breastfed infants. Prospective randomized single blind controlled study. Teaching Hospital. 109 apparently healthy primi and second gravida women registered at the antenatal clinic were included in the study and followed up for three months postpartum. Serum retinol levels of pregnant mothers in their third trimester (35-37 weeks) and cord blood levels after delivery were estimated. Mothers were then assigned to two groups. The experimental group included 53 mothers who received a single dose of 2 lakh units of Vitamin A orally. The control group had 56 mothers who did not receive Vitamin A. Mothers and infants were followed up for three months. The serum retinol of infants and the breast milk retinol levels were estimated at the end of three months and the results were compared. The growth of the infants was also monitored. Subclinical Vitamin A deficiency was seen in 29.67% of pregnant women. At the end of three months, 69.6% of mothers in the control group had breast milk retinol levels below 30 mg/dl, as opposed to 36.1% in the experimental group. Forty five per cent of infants in the control group had subclinical vitamin A deficiency compared to none in the experimental group. There was no difference in the growth of infants in the two groups. However, the infant serum and the breast milk retinol levels were significantly higher in the supplemented group. There is a high prevalence of inapparent Vitamin A deficiency (29.7%) in pregnant women in their third trimester from lower socio-economic strata. Postpartum Vitamin A supplementation had a beneficial impact on the infant serum retional and the breast milk retinol level but no effect on infant growth.

Abstract 228 of 500

To study the efficacy of neostigmine compared with placebo for the antagonism of neuromuscular blockade at the end of a mivacurium infusion, and to determine its optimal dose. One hundred adult patients undergoing an elective surgical procedure received a standardized anaesthetic with 20-30 micrograms.kg-1 alfentanil, a propofol infusion and nitrous oxide. Muscle relaxation was maintained at 90-95% T1 depression with 0.2 mg.kg-1 mivacurium followed by an infusion. Neuromuscular blockade was measured with an integrated evoked electromyogram in response to train-of-four (TOF) stimuli at the ulnar nerve every 20 sec. Patients were randomized into four groups. At the end of surgery, the mivacurium infusion was stopped and patients received, immediately, in a double-blind manner, neostigmine (10, 20, or 40 micrograms.kg-1) or placebo according to a random number table. The T1 and TOF ratio were recorded until adequate recovery of neuromuscular function (TOF ratio > 0.70). During the reversal period, non-invasive blood pressure and heart rate were recorded every minute. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was recorded in the recovery room. Data from 94 patients who completed the protocol were analysed. Compared with placebo, neostigmine 10 micrograms.kg-1 did not reduce the time to TOF > 0.70 (17.0 +/- 5.1 vs 14.6 +/- 4.2 min respectively). However the time was decreased with neostigmine 20 micrograms.kg-1 and 40 micrograms.kg-1 (P < 0.001), but with no difference between these last two groups (11.4 +/- 3.0 and 11.4 +/- 3.5 min respectively). Changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were not different between the four groups. Very few PONV events were observed in all groups (global incidence 7.4%). Recovery of neuromuscular blockade following a mivacurium infusion is accelerated by neostigmine. A dose of neostigmine 20 micrograms.kg-1 appears optimal with no further reduction in recovery time obtained from a larger dose.

Abstract 229 of 500

Saccharomyces boulardii (SB) is a yeast that acts both as a probiotic and as a polyamine producer. Probiotics prevent the overgrowth of pathogens in the gut while polyamines enhance intestinal maturation. The aim of this randomized study was to investigate the ability of SB to modify the gut microbial ecology and its function. A total of 87 healthy babies with gestational age 28-32 weeks were studied. They were randomly assigned to receive a preterm formula to which SB or maltodextrins was added for 30 days. Evaluations were made on the following: SB tolerance and weight gain, faecal flora analysis, intestinal D-xylose absorption and faecal lipid excretion. SB was well tolerated by the infants. There was no difference in weight gain between the two groups. Median log of colony forming units per gram of faeces for Escherichia coli and enterococci was significantly lower in the SB group [E. coli: 2.67 (0.045) vs. 2.75 (0.058), P<0.001; enterococci: 2.14 (0.359) vs. 2.19 (0.138), P<0.05]. On the other hand, the number of bifidobacteria and staphylococci in the stools was significantly higher in the SB group [bifidobacteria: 2.65 (0.083) vs. 2.27 (0.075), P<0.001; staphylococci: 1.23 (0.869) vs. 0.6 (0.281), P<0.001]. D-Xylose and lipid absorption was not improved by SB [median blood D-xylose: 1.5 (0.4) mmol/l vs. 1.35 (0.3) mmol/l, P>0.1; median stool steatocrit: 64% (3.05%) vs. 65% (2.72%) P>0.5]. An SB-supplemented formula is well tolerated by preterm infants, it has a beneficial effect on stool flora bringing it closer to that of breast fed babies but it does not improve D-xylose or lipid gut absorption.

Abstract 230 of 500

To compare the efficacy of vaginal and oral misoprostol for the induction of labour in women with intra-uterine foetal death (IUFD). A prospective randomised clinical trial, comparing 200 microg oral and 200 microg vaginal misoprostol, six hourly for a maximum of four doses for the induction of labour in women with IUFD. Ga-Rankuwa hospital (Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology), Pretoria, South Africa. It is a tertiary institution serving predominantly black indigenous population. The primary outcome measure was the induction to delivery time, and secondary outcome measures were the number of patients requiring augmentation with oxytocin and all complications were noted. Twenty women were randomised to the vaginal route and 18 to the oral route. The induction to delivery time was shorter with vaginal misoprostol (13.5 +/- 8.3 hrs) compared to oral misoprostol (21.4 +/- 13.9 hrs; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the amount of misoprostol needed to achieve successful induction in the two groups. More women (10/18) who received oral misoprostol required oxytocin augmentation to complete the induction of labour compared with 4/20 women in the vaginal group (p < 0.05; Odds Ratio 2.8; 95% Cl 1.36 - 4.24). There were no cases of failed induction. The systemic side effects (shivering, diarrhoea, vomiting and pyrexia) were more common with oral misoprostol (44.5%) compared to vaginal misoprostol (20%). This difference gives an overall Odds Ratio of 2.2 at 95% Cl of 1.6-2.8(p < 0.05). Vaginal misoprostol achieved successful induction of labour in women with IUFD in a shorter time than oral misoprostol with significantly less side effects.

Abstract 231 of 500

Efficacy and safety of i.v. dermatan sulphate (DS) and heparin (H) in controlling laboratory alterations due to DIC were compared in 10 patients with acute leukaemia, in a prospective, randomised pilot study. The time courses of the coagulation and fibrinolysis markers for DIC were similar in the two treatment groups except for activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time, which were prolonged in the H but not in the DS group. Blood product support tended to be greater in the H than in the DS group. DS appears to be as effective as H in controlling thrombin production during leukaemic cytolysis and may represent a safer alternative to H in the management of DIC in acute leukaemia.

Abstract 232 of 500

High-dose transarterial (TA) technique results in high effectiveness of the axillary block. The technique is fast and simple, but does not produce a satisfactory success rate when using the manufacturer's recommended dose of mepivacaine. The multiple nerve stimulation (MNS) technique requires more time and experience. This double-blind study compared effectiveness, safety and the time used to obtain an effective analgesia in 101 patients, having an axillary block by either TA or MNS techniques. Mepivacaine with adrenaline (MEPA), 850 mg, was used for the initial block. Five millilitres of 1% solution was injected subcutaneously. In the TA group, 20 mL of 2% solution was injected deep to, and 20 mL superficial to the axillary artery. In the MNS group, four terminal motor nerves were electrolocated in the axilla, and injected with 10 mL each. Analgesia was assessed every 10 min and, when needed, supplemented after 30 min. The block was effective when analgesia was present in all sensory nerve areas distal to the elbow. The MNS group required median 11 min for block performance compared with 8 min for the TA group (P < 0.001). Latency of the initial block was shorter and the frequency of supplemental analgesia lower in the MNS group (median 10 min and 6%) than in the TA group (30 min and 36%, respectively), P < 0.001. All incomplete blocks were successfully supplemented. However, the total time to obtain an effective block was shorter in the MNS group (23 min) than in the TA group (37 min), P < 0.001. Two patients in each group had signs and symptoms of systemic toxicity, the most serious being atrial fibrillation and temporary loss of consciousness in a cardiovascularly medicated patient. The local adverse effects (intravascular injections and haematomas) were fewer in the MNS group, P < 0.001. The MNS technique of axillary block by four injections of 10 mL of 2% MEPA produces faster and more extensive block than the TA technique by two injections of 20 mL. Therefore, the MNS technique requires fewer supplementary blocks and results in faster patient readiness for surgery. However, high doses of MEPA may result in dangerous systemic toxic reactions.

Abstract 233 of 500

Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition that is a risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a disease whose incidence is rapidly increasing. Because aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as celecoxib, may decrease the risk of developing esophageal cancer, we investigated the effect of long-term administration of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia. Chemoprevention for Barrett's Esophagus Trial (CBET) is a phase IIb multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus and low- or high-grade dysplasia. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo, both administered orally twice daily, and then stratified by grade of dysplasia. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 48 weeks of treatment in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia between the celecoxib and placebo arms. Secondary and tertiary outcomes included evaluation of changes in histology and expression levels of relevant biomarkers. All statistical tests were two-sided. From April 1, 2000, through June 30, 2003, 222 patients were registered into CBET, and 100 of them with low- or high-grade Barrett's dysplasia were randomly assigned to treatment (49 to celecoxib and 51 to placebo). After 48 weeks of treatment, no difference was observed in the median change in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia or cancer between treatment groups in either the low-grade (median change with celecoxib = -0.09, interquartile range [IQR] = -0.32 to 0.14 and with placebo = -0.07, IQR = -0.26 to 0.12; P = .64) or high-grade (median change with celecoxib = 0.12, IQR = -0.31 to 0.55, and with placebo = 0.02, IQR = -0.24 to 0.28; P = .88) stratum. No statistically significant differences in total surface area of the Barrett's esophagus; in prostaglandin levels; in cyclooxygenase-1/2 mRNA levels; or in methylation of tumor suppressor genes p16, adenomatous polyposis coli, and E-cadherin were found with celecoxib compared with placebo. Administration of 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily for 48 weeks of treatment does not appear to prevent progression of Barrett's dysplasia to cancer.

Abstract 234 of 500

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of isoflavones on climacteric-related symptoms and on the endometrium in postmenopausal women, in a prospective, open, randomized, clinical trial performed at the Menopause Clinic of our Department. Seventy postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to two treatment groups receiving 12 cycles of treatment with genistein (group A) or calcium (group B). In all patients ultrasonographic endometrial thickness and Kupperman Index (KI) were evaluated at baseline and after 6 and 12 cycles of treatment. At baseline no significant difference was detected in endometrial thickness and in KI between groups A and B. After 6 and 12 cycles of treatment, no significant difference was observed in endometrial thickness between or within groups. Endometrial thickness was lower than 5 mm in all cases before and during treatment except in two cases in group B and in one case in group A after 12 months. At 6 and 12 months, the KI was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in group A in comparison with baseline values and group B. We conclude that genistein administration reduces climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women and does not increase endometrial thickness.

Abstract 235 of 500

Recently, sirolimus (SRL) was introduced as an immunosuppressant in solid-organ transplantation. This study evaluated combinations of SRL and tacrolimus (Tac). This 6-month study investigated the safety and efficacy of Tac and steroids in combination with three different doses of SRL in renal-transplant recipients. A total of 104 patients were randomized in four groups: one group received Tac and steroids (control n=28), and three groups also received the following daily SRL doses: 0.5 mg (TacSRL0.5, n=25), 1 mg (TacSRL1, n=25), or 2 mg (TacSRL2, n=26). Tac doses were adjusted to whole-blood trough levels. Steroids were tapered from 20 mg per day to 5 mg per day. The SRL groups underwent a second randomization to discontinue SRL at either month 3 or 5. At month 6, patient survival rates were 100%, 100%, 96.0%, and 100%, and graft survival rates were 96.4%, 84.0%, 88.0%, and 84.6%, respectively. The overall safety profile was similar in all groups. The incidences of infections during months 1 to 3 were similar in all groups (control 46.4%, TacSRL0.5 32.0%, TacSRL1 56.0%, TacSRL2 46.2%). The 3-month incidences of hypercholesteremia (cholesterol >240 mg/dL or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >160 mg/dL) were 21.4%, 36.0%, 48.0%, and 50.0% (P=0.019). Lipid levels improved after withdrawal of SRL. The 3-month incidences of biopsy-proven acute rejection were 28.6% (control), 8.0% (TacSRL0.5), 8.0% (TacSRL1), and 3.8% (TacSRL2) (P=0.014). Tac in combination with low doses of SRL provides a very effective and safe regimen.

Abstract 236 of 500

The acupuncture treatment situation was beneficial to the majority of people with low back pain. This was shown by the use of short-term controls and long-term controls, although the latter were not intended in the study design. After acupuncture, there was a 51% pain reduction in the average pain score in the Immediate Treatment Group. The short-term controls, the Delayed Treatment Group, had no reduction whatsoever in their pain scores at the comparable followup period. Later, the Delayed Treatment Group bere also treated by acupuncturists, and reported 62% less pain. When these two treatment groups were compared at 40 weeks with long-term controls (Inadequate Treatment Group), the Inadequate Treatment Group still had the same pain scores, on the average, as when they enrolled in the study. Both treatment groups, on the average, had 30% lower pain scores. Furthermore, 58% of the treatment groups felt that they were definitely improved at 40 weeks, while only 11% of the Inadequate Treatment Group felt definitely improved at 40 weeks.

Abstract 237 of 500

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a serious problem after lung transplantation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CytoGam, a CMV hyperimmune globulin (CMV-IGIV), as CMV prophylaxis after lung transplantation. This prospective, randomized, open-label study compared prophylaxis with CMV-IGIV and no prophylaxis in 44 CMV-seropositive lung transplant recipients. The primary end-point was development of CMV viremia during the first year after transplantation. Cytomegalovirus viremia was detected in 13 of 22 recipients without prophylaxis and in 16 of 22 recipients with CMV-IGIV prophylaxis (p = 0.19). Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis developed in 8 controls vs in 11 CMV-IGIV recipients (p = 0.54). We found no significant difference between the groups in the incidence of positive shell vial assays (6.8% +/- 6.5% without vs 11.2% +/- 10.1% with prophylaxis, p = 0.09) or in the attack rate of CMV pneumonitis (0.41 +/- 0.59 episodes/patient without vs 0.86 +/- 0.99 episodes/patient with prophylaxis, p = 0.07). Similarly, no difference was apparent in the time to onset of CMV viremia, to detection of CMV DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes by polymerase chain reaction, or to development of CMV pneumonitis. The incidence of acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and the survival rate during the first post-transplant year did not differ between the groups. Prophylaxis with CMV-IGIV alone did not decrease CMV viremia or pneumonitis, did not decrease the incidence of acute rejection or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, and did not affect 1-year survival of CMV-seropositive lung transplant recipients at our center.

Abstract 238 of 500

To evaluate the efficacy of four early intramuscular injections of vitamin E given in addition to continuous minimal oral vitamin E supplementation, 168 very low-birth-weight infants (less than or equal to 1,500 g) have enrolled in a randomized, double-masked, clinical study. All infants received vitamin E orally, 100 mg/kg/d. In addition, on days 1, 2, 4, and 6, seventy-nine infants received vitamin E intramuscularly, 15, 10, 10, and 10 mg/kg, respectively. On the same days, 89 control infants received placebo intramuscular injections. Multivariate analysis of the 135 infants who survived greater than or equal to 10 weeks showed no significant difference in the development of severe retrolental fibroplasia between these two supplementation schedules (P = .86). Plasma vitamin E levels never exceeded a mean of 3.3 mg/100 mL, and no toxicity was observed. Ultrastructural analyses of seven pairs of whole eye donations from infants receiving IM vitamin E demonstrated identical kinetics of gap junction formation between adjacent spindle cells as compared with 13 pairs of whole eye donations from control infants (P greater than .3). Therefore, oral vitamin E supplementation affords retinal protection against the development of severe retrolental fibroplasia when initiated on the first day of life and maintained continuously until retinal vascularization is complete.

Abstract 239 of 500

Between April 1984 and May 1989, 77 eligible patients with invasive, nonmetastatic (stage M0) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were stratified after radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection on the basis of nodal status (stage pN0 versus pN1-2) and were randomly assigned to either observation or postoperative cisplatin chemotherapy (3 courses of 90 mg./m.2 cisplatin given for 3 consecutive days at monthly intervals). Patient eligibility included a creatinine clearance of greater than 60 ml. per minute. There were 40 eligible patients in the control group (median age 61 years) and 37 in the cisplatin group (median age 64 years). In regard to postoperative tumor stage and nodal status, there was no statistical difference between the 2 patient groups. In the cisplatin group 21 patients received the full dose, 9 required dose reduction and 7 refused treatment. Median followup was 5 years 9 months (range 3 to 8 years). Survival analysis showed no significant difference (log rank p = 0.65) between the 40 patients in the control group and the 37 in the cisplatin group. The survival rate at 5 years was 54% (95% confidence interval 39 to 69%) in the control group and 57% (95% confidence interval 40 to 74%) in the treatment group. Patients with cancer confined to the bladder wall (stage pT3a or less) had a 5-year overall survival rate of 70% and those with tumor growth in the perivesical fat or into the prostate (stages pT3b plus pT4a) had a 5-year overall survival rate of 40%. This difference in survival between the low stage subgroup (stages pT3a or less) and the high stage subgroup (pT3b plus pT4a) is highly significant (p = 0.0043). However, no difference between the controls and the cisplatin group was found within either the low or high stage subgroups. The reasons for failing to show a survival benefit from adjuvant high dose cisplatin monotherapy after radical cystectomy are discussed.

Abstract 242 of 500

Steroid treatment is widely used in acute cerebral infarction yet its value is controversial. High dose dexamethasone (480 mg over 12 days) was given in a double blind, randomised controlled trial to 113 consecutive eligible patients with acute cerebral infarction admitted to an acute stroke unit. Those with stroke for more than 48 hours, known embolic sources, diabetes, and infection were excluded. Death and quality of survival were recorded over 21 days. The active drug group (54 patients) matched the placebo group (59 patients) for age, initial stroke score, delay in beginning treatment, and other relevant variables. The two groups did not differ significantly in death rate or quality of survivorship. The small difference in mortality between the two groups may have represented a marginal therapeutic effect, which might reach significance in a larger sample. The widespread use of steroids in response to such a marginal therapeutic gain would expose large numbers of patients with stroke to more serious hazards of steroid treatment and convert patients who would otherwise have died into neurovegetative survivors. High dose steroid treatment was ineffective in ischaemic stroke, and the data suggest that further evaluation by a larger multicentre trial is not justified.

Abstract 243 of 500

Since previous reports have suggested that somatostatin may be of value in the control of acute variceal haemorrhage, we compared its efficacy with that of injection sclerotherapy in a randomised controlled clinical trial. Eighty consecutive patients with endoscopically-proven severe variceal bleeding were randomised to injection sclerotherapy (n = 41) or somatostatin (n = 39) given as a continuous infusion of 250 micrograms/h for 5 days plus daily bolus administration of 250 micrograms. The efficacy of injection sclerotherapy and somatostatin infusion in controlling haemorrhage and preventing rebleeding (censored at 5 days), mortality (censored at 28 days) and complications was compared. The aetiology of the portal hypertension and transfusion requirements was similar between the two groups, but there were more patients with severe liver disease (Child's C) in the somatostatin group. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in the initial (p = 1.0) or overall control of bleeding (p = 0.58). Furthermore, somatostatin was as effective as injection sclerotherapy in controlling bleeding in patients with severe liver disease or in those actively bleeding at the time of their endoscopy. The relative risk of rebleeding whilst receiving somatostatin compared to injection sclerotherapy was 1.39 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.73; 0.52], but this was reduced to 0.98 (95% CI 0.37; 2.67) when readjusted for Child's grading, the only prognostic factor shown to be of significance. Mortality was not significantly different between the two groups of patients (p = 0.31). The relative risk of dying whilst receiving somatostatin compared to injection sclerotherapy was 1.6 (95% CI 3.93; 0.66) but was reduced to 1.03 (95% CI 0.47; 2.47) when adjusted for Child's grading, the only significant prognostic factor. Complications in the somatostatin group were minor and less frequent than after injection sclerotherapy. The results of this study indicate that somatostatin is a safe treatment, which is as effective an endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for acute variceal bleeding.

Abstract 244 of 500

Thirty-six postmenopausal women with objectively verified stress incontinence were treated with oral estriol (Triovex, 2 mg x 1) and phenylpropanolamine (Kontexin, 50 mg x 2) alone and in combination. After an initial four-week single-blind period with phenylpropanolamine (PPA), either estriol or estriol and PPA were given randomly in four-week periods, in a crossover design. PPA and estriol in combination as well as PPA alone, raised the intraurethral pressure and significantly reduced the urinary loss by 35 per cent in a standardized physical strain test. In women with an initial low urethral pressure estriol also induced pressure increase. The leakage episodes and the assessed leakage amounts were significantly reduced by both estriol and PPA given separately as single treatment (28%) or when given as combined therapy (40%). Most of the women preferred the combined treatment to either drug alone. Additive but no synergistic effects are indicated.

Abstract 245 of 500

Despite many associations between late luteal phase dysphoric disorder (LLPDD) and major depression, there have been no placebo-controlled trials of an antidepressant in this disorder. The authors conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine in the treatment of LLPDD. The diagnosis of LLPDD was based on daily, prospective self-rating forms that subjects completed over two menstrual cycles. Subjects with other psychiatric disorders, determined by the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia interview, were excluded from the study. Women who continued to meet criteria for LLPDD after a single-blind trial of placebo were randomly assigned to treatment for two menstrual cycles with either fluoxetine 20 mg/day (N = 10) or placebo (N = 10). Nine of the 10 subjects receiving fluoxetine responded to treatment, whereas only 2 of the 10 receiving placebo did (p less than .0003). Symptoms decreased significantly in all 10 LLPDD diagnostic categories in the fluoxetine-treated group. All subjects taking fluoxetine elected to continue with this treatment after completion of the study. These results suggest that fluoxetine is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for LLPDD.

Abstract 247 of 500

Suppurative corneal ulcers due to filamentous fungi are a serious and intractable problem in many tropical developing countries. In vitro studies and a small pilot study have shown that chlorhexidine gluconate is effective. The aim was to establish the optimum concentration which would be appropriate to use in a larger randomized clinical trial. A masked randomized clinical trial of three concentrations of chlorhexidine compared with natamycin 5% was carried out in consecutive patients with established corneal ulcers shown by microscopy to contain fungal hyphae and later proven to be culture positive. Topical treatments were applied 1/2-hourly to 2-hourly for up to 5 days, with reduced frequency thereafter, and all patients were re-assessed at 21 days. Of 60 patients entered in the trial, 2 were lost to follow-up, and 12 were classified as 'severe' with little prospect of recovery. At 5 days the response was related to the concentration of chlorhexidine, with 0.2% giving the best results. Compared with the response to natamycin as the referent, the relative efficacy was 1.17 with chlorhexidine 0.05%, 1.43 with 0.1%, and 2.00 with 0.2%. The superiority of 0.2% chlorhexidine over natamycin was statistically significant (relative efficacy 2.20, p = 0.043) in patients not having had prior antifungal treatment. This preliminary study justifies further trials of chlorhexidine as a primary treatment for fungal corneal ulcers in circumstances where specific antifungal agents are not available.

Abstract 248 of 500

Diltiazem reduces the cyclosporine dose required for blood levels in the therapeutic target range by 30 to 40%. The effect of diltiazem on the pharmacokinetic disposition of cyclosporine after oral Neoral application is unknown and it is unclear whether or not the diltiazem-cyclosporine interaction is affected by the galenic cyclosporine formulation. Fifty-one stable renal allograft patients (19 females, 32 males) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized and double-blind study. The patients were assigned to 3 treatment groups: with diltiazem (I, n = 17), with nifedipine (II, n = 17) and without calcium channel blockers (III, n = 17). Nine patients in each group received Sandimmun and 8 patients Neoral. Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and its metabolites AM1 and AM9 were measured using HPLC for 12 weeks. The 3 treatment groups were not different in respect to age, gender distribution and serum creatinine concentration. Cyclosporine doses were adjusted on basis of the blood levels. The cyclosporine doses required to achieve target blood levels were significantly lower in group I compared with group II (-43%) and group III (-33%; p < 0.0001). Although the cyclosporine blood concentrations in all groups were in the therapeutic range, the blood levels in group I showed a much lower variability. The blood concentrations of the metabolite AM1 in group I were significantly higher than those in groups II and III after dose correction (p < 0.0001), those of AM9 were significantly lower in group I than in groups II and III (p < 0.0001). The average dose, and the blood concentration of cyclosporine was not different when patients receiving Neoral were compared with those receiving Sandimmun within the groups. In the patients in group I, the blood concentration of metabolite AM1 was significantly higher after Sandimmun application than after Neoral. No other differences in the metabolite concentrations were detected within the groups comparing patients taking Sandimmun or Neoral. The incidences of acute rejection were lower in group I (17.6%) than in the other groups (II: 52.9%; III: 41%). Diltiazem significantly reduced the necessary dose of cyclosporine. Compared with groups II and III, the blood concentrations were more stable in patients in group I. Diltiazem increased the blood concentration of AM1 in patients treated with Sandimmun to a larger extent than in patients taking Neoral. No additional pharmacokinetic differences of the 2 cyclosporine applications different with Sandimmun or Neoral were found.

Abstract 249 of 500

The burden of Plasmodium vivax infections has been underappreciated, especially in southeast Asia where chloroquine resistant strains have emerged. Our aim was to compare the safety and efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with that of artemether-lumefantrine in patients with uncomplicated malaria caused by multidrug-resistant P falciparum and P vivax. 774 patients in southern Papua, Indonesia, with slide-confirmed malaria were randomly assigned to receive either artemether-lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and followed up for at least 42 days. The primary endpoint was the overall cumulative risk of parasitological failure at day 42 with a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, trial number 00157833. Of the 754 evaluable patients enrolled, 466 had infections with P falciparum, 175 with P vivax, and 113 with a mixture of both species. The overall risk of failure at day 42 was 43% (95% CI 38-48) for artemether-lumefantrine and 19% (14-23) for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (hazard ratio=3.0, 95% CI 2.2-4.1, p<0.0001). After correcting for reinfections, the risk of recrudescence of P falciparum was 4.4% (2.6-6.2) with no difference between regimens. Recurrence of vivax occurred in 38% (33-44) of patients given artemether-lumefantrine compared with 10% (6.9-14.0) given dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (p<0.0001). At the end of the study, patients receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were 2.0 times (1.2-3.6) less likely to be anaemic and 6.6 times (2.8-16) less likely to carry vivax gametocytes than were those given artemether-lumefantrine. Both dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and artemether-lumefantrine were safe and effective for the treatment of multidrug-resistant uncomplicated malaria. However, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine provided greater post-treatment prophylaxis than did artemether-lumefantrine, reducing P falciparum reinfections and P vivax recurrences, the clinical public-health importance of which should not be ignored.

Abstract 250 of 500

Hypericum (St. John's wort) has been shown to be as efficacious and well tolerated as standard antidepressants in the treatment of depression but has not been compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This study compared hypericum and the SSRI sertraline in the treatment of depression. In a double-blind, randomized study conducted in a community hospital, 30 male and female outpatients (19 women, 11 men; mean age, 45.5 years) with mild to moderate depression received 600 mg/d of a standardized extract of hypericum (LI 160) or 50 mg/d sertraline for I week, followed by hypericum 900 mg/d or sertraline 75 mg/d for 6 weeks. The severity of symptoms, as assessed by scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Clinical Global Impression scale, was significantly reduced in both treatment groups (P < 0.01). Clinical response (defined as a > or =50% reduction in HAM-D scores) was noted in 47% of patients receiving hypericum and 40% of those receiving sertraline. The difference was not statistically significant. Both agents were well tolerated. A post hoc power analysis indicated that failure to reach statistical significance between treatments resulted primarily from an absence of clinical differences rather than the small sample size. The hypericum extract was at least as effective as sertraline in the treatment of mild to moderate depression in a small group of outpatients.

Abstract 251 of 500

Anecdotal reports suggest that certain honey dressings have a positive effect on wound healing. However, there is limited empirical evidence supporting its use. This double-blind randomised controlled trial investigated the effect of a honey dressing on wound healing following toenail surgery with matrix phenolisation. Participants (n=100) were randomly assigned to receive either an active manuka honey dressing (n=52) or paraffin-impregnated tulle gras (n=48). The primary outcome was time (days) taken for complete re-epithelialisation of the nail bed. Mean healing times were 40.30 days (SD 18.21) for the honey group and 39.98 days (SD 25.42) for the paraffin tulle gras group. Partial avulsion wounds healed statistically significantly faster (p=0.01) with paraffin tulle gras (19.62 days, SD 9.31) than with the honey dressing (31.76 days, SD 18.8), but no significant difference (p=0.21) was found following total avulsion when comparing honey (45.28 days, SD 18.03.) with paraffin tulle gras dressings (52.03 days, SD 21.3). The results suggest that patients may benefit more from paraffin tulle gras dressings than honey dressings following partial toenail avulsion. No statistically significant difference was found for healing times after total toenail avulsion, although the marginal benefit of the honey dressing on these healing times warrants further investigation.

Abstract 252 of 500

One hundred thirty-three evaluable patients with advanced breast cancer entered a randomized trial comparing epirubicin 60 mg/m2 with a combination of epirubicin 45 mg/m2 and vindesine 3 mg/m2 day 1 and 8 every 4 weeks. In all 10 premenopausal women an oophorectomy was performed. Seventy-five patients had previously received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) for advanced disease and 68 had received adjuvant chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or CMF). Among evaluable patients (72 in the epirubicin group and 61 in the epirubicin + vindesine group) response rates were as follows: complete response--seven versus six; partial response--31 versus 22; no change--16 versus 17 (p greater than 0.40). Median time to disease progression was 6 months in both groups and median survival times were identical (12 months). Thrombocytopenia was less frequent in the epirubicin + vindesine group (p less than 0.01). In the epirubicin + vindesine group, mild to moderate peripheral neuropathy was observed in 40% of the patients. Congestive heart failure developed in one patient with a cumulative dose of epirubicin less than 1000 mg/m2 and in 7 of 15 patients who had greater than 1000 mg/m2. Four died of this cause. In conclusion, epirubicin is effective as a single agent for advanced breast cancer. The combination with vindesine does not increase its efficacy.

Abstract 253 of 500

To compare the impact of active compression-decompression (ACD) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and standard CPR on the outcomes of in-hospital and prehospital victims of cardiac arrest. Randomized controlled trial with blinding of allocation using a sealed container. (1) Emergency departments, wards, and intensive care units of 5 university hospitals and (2) all locations outside hospitals in 2 midsized cities. A total of 1784 adults who had cardiac arrest. Patients received either standard or ACD CPR throughout resuscitation. Survival for 1 hour and to hospital discharge and the modified Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). All characteristics were similar in the standard and ACD CPR groups for the 773 in-hospital patients and the 1011 prehospital patients. For in-hospital patients, there were no significant differences between the standard (n = 368) and ACD (n = 405) CPR groups in survival for 1 hour (35.1% vs 34.6%; P = .89), in survival until hospital discharge (11.4% vs 10.4%; P = .64), or in the median MMSE score of survivors (37 in both groups). For patients who collapsed outside the hospital, there were also no significant differences between the standard (n = 510) and ACD (n = 501) CPR groups in survival for 1 hour (16.5% vs 18.2%; P = .48), in survival to hospital discharge (3.7% vs 4.6%; P = .49), or in the median MMSE score of survivors (35 in both groups). Exploration of clinically important subgroups failed to identify any patients who appeared to benefit from ACD CPR. ACD CPR did not improve survival or neurologic outcomes in any group of patients with cardiac arrest.

Abstract 254 of 500

In spite of its widespread use after orthopaedic procedures, the literature evaluating the clinical efficacy of cryotherapy is controversial. The purpose of this prospective randomized trial was to compare two different temperatures for administering cryotherapy after total knee arthroplasty with regards to short-term postoperative outcomes. Sixty-four subjects were assigned either the 45 degrees F group or the 75 degrees F group. Subjects in the 45 degrees group were as likely to report a lower pain score at the time of follow-up compared to the 75 degrees group. Our results demonstrate no additional analgesic effect associated with the lower temperature of cryotherapy. Postoperative narcotic consumption, postoperative drainage, self-reported knee function, and range of motion were not affected by the different cryotherapy temperatures. No adverse effects were reported with the cryotherapy treatment.

Abstract 255 of 500

Single small enhancing computerized tomographic (CT) lesions (SSECTLs) are common in children with focal seizures. These are considered to represent solitary cysticercus granulomas. Controversy exists regarding their treatment. To evaluate the efficacy of albendazole in cases of focal seizures with SSECTLs. Randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial. Pediatric service of Nehru Hospital, PGIMER, an urban tertiary care teaching hospital. 63 children between 2 and 12 years of age with focal seizures for <3 months and SSECTLs. All children were randomly assigned to receive either albendazole (15 mg/kg/ day) or placebo for 28 days. CT scan was done at 1 and 3 months after beginning treatment. Codes opened after 6 months of inclusion in the study showed that 31 had received albendazole and 32 had received placebo. All children were followed up for at least 15 months. Disappearance of lesions on CT scan was noted in 41% of albendazole vs. 16.2% of placebo patients after 1 month of follow-up (P < 0.05) and 64.5% of albendazole- vs. 37.5% of placebo-treated patients after 3 months of follow-up (P < 0.05). During the first 4 weeks of therapy seizure recurrence was seen in 9.7% of albendazole vs. 3.2% of placebo-treated children (odds ratio, 3.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.33 to 33.8). After 4 weeks seizure recurrence was seen in 31.3% of placebo-treated children vs. 12.9% of albendazole-treated children (odds ratio, 3.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.18 to 11.15). Albendazole therapy results in significantly faster and increased resolution of solitary cysticercus lesions (SSECTLs) and appears to reduce the risk of late seizure recurrences.

Abstract 256 of 500

AF is a frequent arrhythmia complicating CABG, and it is well known that dispersion and prolongation of P wave increases the risk of AF. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of magnesium (Mg) treatment on P-wave duration and dispersion in patients undergoing CABG. The study included 148 consecutive patients (33 women, 115 men; mean age 62.1 +/- 7.0 years) undergoing CABG who were randomly allocated to two groups. Group A consisted of 93 patients to whom 1.5 g daily MgSO(4) infusion was applied the day before surgery, just after operation, and 4 days following surgery, and group B consisted of 55 control patients. From the preoperative and postoperative fourth day, 12-lead ECG recordings, duration of the P waves, and P-wave dispersions were calculated. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to age, sex, and blood Mg level. Comparison of the baseline and day 4 ECG measurements showed no difference as far as heart rates, duration of PQ, and QRS intervals were concerned. AF developed in 2 (2%) cases in group A and in 20 (36%) cases in group B (P < 0.001). There was no difference between the two groups when average basal P max, P min, P dispersion, and day 4 P min values were compared. In group A, fourth day P max (94.3 +/- 11.8 vs 101.0 +/- 13.2 ms; P = 0.0025) and P dispersion (38.2 +/- 9.2 vs 44.9 +/- 10.9 ms; P = 0.0002 ) were significantly lower as compared to group B. Comparing the patients who developed AF, and who did not, no difference was detected with regard to baseline P max, P min, P dispersion, and day 4 P min. Day 4 P max (95.1 +/- 11.8 vs 106.4 +/- 14.0 ms, P = 0.0015) and P dispersion (38.9 +/- 8.8 vs 50.7 +/- 13.0 ms, P = 0.001) of patients who developed AF were significantly higher. Baseline Mg levels were similar in patients who developed AF, and who did not, but the day 4 Mg level was significantly lower in AF group (2.0 +/- 0.23 vs 2.15 +/- 0.26 mg/dL, P < 0.001). Perioperative Mg treatment reduces P dispersion and the risk of developing AF in patients undergoing CABG.

Abstract 257 of 500

In a multicentre placebo-controlled double-blind study 61 patients with spinal cord injuries and detrusor hyperreflexia were treated: 20 mg trospium chloride was given twice daily over a period of 3 weeks. Pre- and posttreatment urodynamic measurements demonstrated large improvements in maximum cystometric capacity (mean = 138.1 ml), decreased maximum detrusor pressure (mean = -37.8 cm H2O) and an increase in compliance (mean = 12.1 ml/cm H2O) in the treatment group. Urodynamic parameters in the placebo group remained substantially unchanged. Comparisons between the two groups revealed highly significant differences for these parameters (all, p less than 0.001). No effect on maximum flow rate and residual urine was detected in either group. The incidence of spontaneously reported side-effects was extremely low and comparable for both groups.

Abstract 258 of 500

Previous trials have suggested that calcium supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of preeclampsia. However, differences in study design and a low dietary calcium intake in the populations studied limit acceptance of the data. We randomly assigned 4589 healthy nulliparous women who were 13 to 21 weeks pregnant to receive daily treatment with either 2 g of elemental calcium or placebo for the remainder of their pregnancies. Surveillance for preeclampsia was conducted by personnel unaware of treatment-group assignments, using standardized measurements of blood pressure and urinary protein excretion at uniformly scheduled prenatal visits, protocols for monitoring these measurements during the hospitalization for delivery, and reviews of medical records of unscheduled outpatient visits and all hospitalizations. Calcium supplementation did not significantly reduce the incidence or severity of preeclampsia or delay its onset. Preeclampsia occurred in 158 of the 2295 women in the calcium group (6.9 percent) and 168 of the 2294 women in the placebo group (7.3 percent) (relative risk, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.16). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the prevalence of pregnancy-associated hypertension without preeclampsia (15.3 percent vs. 17.3 percent) or of all hypertensive disorders (22.2 percent vs. 24.6 percent). The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures during pregnancy were similar in both groups. Calcium did not reduce the numbers of preterm deliveries, small-for-gestational-age births, or fetal and neonatal deaths; nor did it increase urolithiasis during pregnancy. Calcium supplementation during pregnancy did not prevent preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertension, or adverse perinatal outcomes in healthy nulliparous women.

Abstract 259 of 500

In the 5-10% of diabetic men with type 1 diabetes, erectile dysfunction (ED) may be a particularly common and unwanted complication. This is the first study focusing exclusively on the effects of sildenafil in men with type 1 diabetes and ED. A total of 188 patients were entered into a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, flexible-dose study and were randomized to receive sildenafil (25-100 mg; n = 95) or placebo (n = 93) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using questions three (Q3; achieving an erection) and four (Q4; maintaining an erection) from the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), a global efficacy question (GEQ; "Did treatment improve your erections?"), and a patient event log of sexual activity. Improvements in mean scores from baseline to end-of-treatment for IIEF Q3 (35.7 vs. 19.9%) and Q4 (68.4 vs. 26.5%) were significant in patients receiving sildenafil compared with those receiving placebo (P = 0.0001). Moreover, the percent of improved erections (GEQ, 66.6 vs. 28.6%) and successful intercourse attempts (63 vs. 33%) was significantly increased with sildenafil compared with placebo. Improvements in sexual function were seen irrespective of the degree of ED severity. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, with headache (20 vs. 8%), flushing (18 vs. 3%), and dyspepsia (8 vs. 1%) reported more often in the sildenafil than in placebo-treated patients. Treatment with sildenafil for ED was effective, resulting in an increased percentage of successful attempts at intercourse, and was well tolerated among men with type 1 diabetes.

To determine the effect of exogenous LH dosage on IVF outcome. Single-blinded (assessor-blinded) study with random assignment of treatment groups. Human Assisted Reproduction Unit, Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Infertile normogonadotropic women undergoing their first cycle of IVF were studied. Patients were randomized to gonadotropin drugs with varying doses of LH per ampule: recombinant FSH containing no LH (group 0, n = 39), urinary FSH containing <1 IU of LH per ampule (group 1, n = 30), hMG containing 25 IU of LH per ampule (group 25, n = 30), and hMG containing 75 IU of LH per ampule (group 75, n = 29). The FSH dose was kept constant at 75 IU per ampule. A long-protocol GnRH-analog regimen was used. Dose and duration of gonadotropin stimulation, follicle and oocyte numbers, implantation rate, and pregnancy rate. The median duration of ovarian stimulation; median number of gonadotropin ampules used; serum E2 levels; and numbers of follicles, oocytes, and embryos were similar among the four groups. Median LH levels on the day of hCG administration, however, differed significantly. Live birth rates per cycle differed markedly, but statistical significance was not achieved (23%, 7%, 20%, and 31% for groups 0, 1, 25, and 75, respectively). A significant trend in implantation rates was noted with increasing LH dosage of the urinary preparations (19%, 10%, 18%, and 28% for groups 0, 1, 25, and 75, respectively). In the present study, although the residual endogenous LH after down-regulation was adequate for ovarian response and E2 synthesis, the addition of exogenous LH improved implantation. An FSH/LH ratio of 75/75 IU per ampule appeared to be the optimum dose.

Abstract 261 of 500

In a randomized double-blind study, the clinical efficacy of methadone vs. methadone and guanfacine was assessed in terms of evolution of opioid withdrawal symptoms during inpatient detoxification. A total of 144 patients were included and randomly allocated to three different treatment groups: methadone alone, and two combined treatment schedules (methadone plus 3 or 4 mg of guanfacine). No differences were observed among the three groups with regard to retention rate throughout the study period. Both therapies, methadone and methadone plus guanfacine, determined a slight increase in withdrawal scores when methadone was discontinued. However, guanfacine was unable to effectively control methadone-associated withdrawal symptoms. These results indicate that guanfacine does not effectively reduce the opioid withdrawal symptoms.

Abstract 262 of 500

Ibuprofen is a peripherally acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug indicated fo ranalgesia, antipyresis, and various arthritic conditions. A solubilized 200 mg liquigel formulation of ibuprofen has been shown to have a more rapid rate of absorption compared with ibuprofen 200 mg tablets. Ibuprofen liquigels have a kinetic profile similar to ibuprofen suspension, with both a higher Cmax and an earlier tmax than any solid tablet. The objective of this single-dose, double-blind, triple-dummy, parallel-group study was to assess the time to onset of relief and overall analgesic efficacy of liquigel ibuprofen 400 mg, ketoprofen 25 mg compared with acetaminophen 1000 mg, and placebo in 239 patients with moderate or severe pain following third molar extractions. Treatments were compared over 6 hours using standard scales for pain intensity and relief and stopwatch onset of meaningful relief. All active treatments provided meaningful relief significantly faster compared with placebo. Ibuprofen provided significantly faster relief compared with acetaminophen and ketoprofen. By the end of the study (6 h), onset of meaningful relief was achieved by 36%, 99%, 96%, and 88% of the patients in the placebo, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen groups, respectively. The median times to onset of relief were > 6 hours for placebo, 25.5 minutes for ketoprofen, 24.2 minutes for ibuprofen, and 29.9 minutes for acetaminophen. In addition, both ibuprofen and ketoprofen showed statistical superiority over acetaminophen at earlier time points on the time-effect curves for pain relief and pain intensity difference. Consistent results were seen with respect to the 6-hour summary efficacy variables: the three active treatments were significantly better than placebo, and ibuprofen was significantly better than both acetaminophen and ketoprofen. Liquigel ibuprofen 400 mg was shown to provide faster relief and superior overall efficacy compared with ketoprofen 25 mg, acetaminophen 1000 mg, and placebo. No serious adverse effects were reported in this single-dose study.

Abstract 263 of 500

The efficacy and safety of ciramadol (Cir) as an analgesic in relieving moderate to severe pain after oral surgery has been studied in 79 patients randomly assigned to receive single oral doses of Cir 15, 30 or 60 mg, codeine 60 mg or placebo. During the 6-hour observation period, the three ciramadol-treated groups indicated greater pain relief than the codeine 60 mg or placebo groups. In general, Cir 60 mg was significantly more effective than codeine 60 mg, and all doses of Cir were superior to placebo. The proportion of patients in each Cir group reporting adverse experiences was significantly higher than in either the placebo or codeine groups. The experimental system proved very effective in demonstrating analgesic potency of Cir. The very high incidence of side-effects in the three ciramadol-treated groups makes it unfit for further clinical use in ambulant patients.

Abstract 264 of 500

Postmenopausal women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are at risk for accelerated bone loss and subsequent fractures. The ongoing Zometa-Femara Adjuvant Synergy Trial (Z-FAST) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in preventing such bone loss. In this multicenter study, postmenopausal women with early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer receiving adjuvant letrozole were randomized to receive up-front or delayed-start zoledronic acid (ZA; 4 mg intravenously every 6 months) for 5 years. Delayed-start ZA was administered if the lumbar spine (LS) or total hip (TH) T score fell below -2.0 or a nontraumatic fracture occurred. The primary endpoint was to compare the change from baseline in LS bone mineral density (BMD) between groups at month 12; secondary endpoints, measured at other predetermined timepoints, included comparing changes in TH BMD, LS BMD, and markers of bone turnover, fracture incidence, and time to disease recurrence. Herein, we report the results of the 36-month interim analysis. Overall, 301 patients were randomized to each group. At month 36, the absolute difference in mean LS and TH BMDs between the up-front and delayed groups was 6.7% and 5.2%, respectively (P < .0001 for both). Although this study was not designed to show antifracture efficacy, the incidence of fractures was slightly higher in the delayed group (up-front, 17 [5.7%] vs. delayed, 19 [6.3%]) but not statistically significant (P = .8638). Pyrexia (27 [9%] vs. 6 [2%]; P = .0002) and bone pain (39 [13%] vs. 20 [6.7%]; P = .01) were more common in up-front patients; cough (13 [4.3%] vs. 27 [9%]; P = .03) was more common in delayed patients. No severe renal dysfunction or confirmed cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw were reported. Disease recurrence was reported in 9 up-front (3.0%) and 16 delayed (5.3%) patients (Kaplan-Meier analysis, P = .127), with an absolute decrease of 2.3%. Up-front ZA more effectively prevents AI-associated bone loss in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer than delaying therapy until substantial bone loss or fracture occurs.

Abstract 265 of 500

The Ginkgo biloba special extract EGb 761 seems to produce neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases of multifactorial origin. There is still debate about the efficacy of Ginkgo biloba special extract EGb 761 compared with second-generation cholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia. Our aim is to assess the efficacy of the Ginkgo biloba special extract E.S. in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type in slowing down the disease's degenerative progression and the patients' cognitive impairment compared with donepezil and placebo. The trial was designed as a 24-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients aged 50-80 years, suffering from mild to moderate dementia, were allocated into one of the three treatments: Ginkgo biloba (160 mg daily dose), donepezil (5 mg daily dose), or placebo group. The degree of severity of dementia was assessed by the Syndrom Kurz test and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Clinical Global Impression score was recorded to assess the change in the patients' conditions and the therapeutic efficacy of tested medications. Our results confirm the clinical efficacy of Ginkgo biloba E.S. (Flavogin) in the dementia of the Alzheimer type, comparable with donepezil clinical efficacy. There are few published trials that have directly compared a cholinesterase inhibitor with Ginkgo for dementia. This study directly compares a cholinesterase inhibitor with Ginkgo biloba for dementia of the Alzheimer type and could be a valid contribution in this debate. Our study suggests that there is no evidence of relevant differences in the efficacy of EGb 761 and donepezil in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia, so the use of both substances can be justified. In addition, this study contributes to establish the efficacy and tolerability of the Ginkgo biloba special extract E.S. in the dementia of the Alzheimer type with special respect to moderately severe stages.

Abstract 266 of 500

An unsupervised toothbrushing study involving 1,339 children from 5 to 13 years of age conducted for three years compared two stannous fluoride dentifrices, one in a calcium pyrophosphate base and the other in a silica gel base, with a nonfluoride control dentifrice. The test dentifrice, stannous fluoride in a silica gel base, reduced caries to a significant extent when compared with the nonfluoride control dentifrice.The percentage of reductions ranged from 15% to 25% for whole mouth and interproximal surface indexes. There was no significant difference between the two fluoride dentifrices.

Abstract 267 of 500

One hundred patients undergoing elective cardiac operations were randomized into placebo (n = 54) and magnesium (n = 46) groups. The magnesium group received six doses of 2.4 g (19.2 mEq) magnesium sulfate intravenously in the first 24 hours after the cardiac operation. The magnesium group had higher serum magnesium concentrations postoperatively (1.09 +/- 0.20 versus 0.75 +/- 0.13 mmol/L; p < 0.0001), postoperative day 1 (1.49 +/- 0.34 versus 0.70 +/- 0.12 mmol/L; p < 0.0001) and postoperative day 2 (0.96 +/- 0.19 versus 0.76 +/- 0.07 mmol/L; p < 0.0001). Patients in the magnesium group had a lower incidence of ventricular tachyarrythmias (VTs) (17.3% versus 51.9%; p = 0.0006), less need for treatment (6.5% versus 20.3%; p < 0.0001), fewer VT episodes/patient (0.3 +/- 0.8 versus 1.39 +/- 1.9; p < 0.0001), and a reduction in the severity of VTs as measured by the modified Lown grade (p = 0.0002). No differences were demonstrated with respect to supraventricular tachyarrythmias. The magnesium group had reduced absolute creatine kinase-MB levels (5.3 +/- 4.2 versus 28.4 +/- 28 IU/L; p = 0.001) as well as creatine kinase-MB fraction (0.01 +/- 0.02 versus 0.05 +/- 0.04; p = 0.001) on postoperative day 1. Serum magnesium concentrations were lower during VTs than during periods of sinus rhythm (0.75 +/- 0.75 versus 1.02 +/- 0.35 mmol/L; p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract 268 of 500

The control of hyperphosphatemia is a major clinical problem in patients with chronic renal failure receiving regular dialysis treatment. Despite continuing concern about aluminum toxicity, aluminum-containing antacids are still used in many of these patients as phosphate-binding agents. Although maximal acceptable doses of aluminum hydroxide have been recommended, the safety and efficacy of these guidelines have not been evaluated. Seventeen children and young adults (mean [+/- SD] age, 14.1 +/- 3.7 years) undergoing regular peritoneal dialysis were randomly assigned to treatment with either aluminum hydroxide (n = 7; maximal dose, 30 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or calcium carbonate (n = 10; dose range, 2.5 to 12 g per day, according to serum phosphorus levels). Aluminum retention was assessed by serial measurements of plasma aluminum, deferoxamine-infusion tests, and measurements of bone aluminum content during a mean (+/- SD) follow-up of 13 +/- 2 months. The evolution of bone disease was also evaluated. Plasma aluminum levels and the increment in plasma aluminum after infusion of deferoxamine increased from base-line values in the patients treated with aluminum hydroxide, and aluminum-related bone disease developed in one patient. Serum phosphorus levels remained higher and serum calcium levels lower in the patients receiving aluminum hydroxide than in those receiving calcium carbonate. The skeletal lesions of secondary hyperparathyroidism improved in 7 of 10 patients receiving calcium carbonate but persisted or progressed in 6 of 7 patients given aluminum hydroxide (P less than 0.025). Aluminum hydroxide is less effective than calcium carbonate as a phosphate-binding agent for the control of hyperphosphatemia and is associated with aluminum retention in children and young adults with chronic renal failure who are receiving dialysis therapy.

Abstract 269 of 500

To determine in a noninferiority study whether mesalamine foam is as effective as mesalamine liquid enema for inducing clinical remission in patients with active left-sided ulcerative colitis (UC). In a multicenter investigator-blind trial, 375 patients with mild-to-moderate UC were randomized to receive mesalamine foam 1 g/80 mL/day or mesalamine liquid enema 1 g/100 mL/day for 4 wk (W). Inclusion criteria were: disease extension at least 5 cm from anorectal junction and not above splenic flexure and Clinical Activity Index (CAI) 1-4 > or = 4. Primary end point was clinical remission at W4 defined as a CAI 1-4 < or = 2. Noninferiority of the foam to liquid enema was declared if the lower limit of the 97.5% unilateral confidence interval (97.5% CI) of the difference in remission rates between foam and liquid enema groups was greater than -15% . Remission rates at W4 in foam versus liquid were 68.3%versus 73.6% in per protocol (PP) population (lower limit of 97.5% CI -15.1%) and 66.7%versus 70.5% in intention-to-treat (ITT) population (97.5% CI -13.4%). Remission rates at W2 were 48.1 %versus 50.6% in ITT (97.5% CI -12.8%) and 49.1%versus 52.1% in PP (97.5% CI -13.8%) in foam versus liquid, respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated. A 4-wk treatment of 1 g mesalamine foam induced a clinical remission in 68% patients versus 73% with 1 g mesalamine liquid enema. Although the noninferiority of mesalamine foam could not be strictly demonstrated at W4 in the PP analysis, it was achieved in the ITT population and at W2 in both populations. Mesalamine foam represents a therapeutic alternative to mesalamine liquid enema in patients with mild-to-moderate active proctitis and proctosigmoiditis.

Abstract 271 of 500

In a single-blind trial, five treatments for painful stiff shoulder were compared for a 4-week assessment period in 60 patients. The treatments were acupuncture, steroid injection with placebo and with active tolmetin sodium, physiotherapy in the form of ultrasound and 'placebo' physiotherapy with placebo tolmetin sodium. Objective assessment was gained by use of goniometer readings to monitor shoulder abduction. Pain was measured by visual analogue scales and by a 4-point scale. Comparative assessment was also recorded and at the end of the study a success or failure was recorded for each patient's treatment. With very few exceptions all patients improved markedly, both in terms of the subjective and objective parameters. No differences between the treatments were detected. The incidence and severity of side-effects was low. It is suggested that the results show that the painful stiff shoulder may be a self-limiting condition and that any beneficial effect was really due to natural recovery. This is an important consideration because patients do not always receive immediate attention when referred to an out-patient department and the use of physiotherapy and acupuncture in such cases, perhaps, should be critically examined.

Abstract 272 of 500

To compare the efficacy of tolterodine plus simplified bladder training (BT) with tolterodine alone in patients with an overactive bladder. In a multicentre, single-blind study at 51 Scandinavian centres, 505 patients aged >or= 18 years with symptoms of urinary frequency (>or= 8 micturitions/24 h) and urgency, with or without urge incontinence, were randomized to oral treatment with either tolterodine 2 mg twice daily plus simplified BT or tolterodine alone. Changes in voiding diary variables were evaluated after 2, 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. The patients' perceptions of their bladder symptoms and tolerability (adverse events) were also determined. In all, 501 patients (75% women) were evaluable on an intention-to-treat basis (244 on tolterodine + BT and 257 on tolterodine alone). Tolterodine significantly reduced the voiding frequency and increased the volume voided per void at all sample times; these effects were significantly increased by adding BT. At the end of the study the median percentage reduction in voiding frequency was greater with tolterodine + BT than with tolterodine alone (33% vs 25%, P < 0.001), while the median percentage increase in volume voided per void was 31% with tolterodine + BT and 20% with tolterodine alone (P < 0.001). There was a median of 81% fewer incontinence episodes than at baseline with tolterodine alone, which was not significantly different from that with tolterodine + BT (- 87%). The two groups had comparable median percentage reductions in urgency episodes. Some 76% of patients on tolterodine + BT reported an improvement in their bladder symptoms relative to baseline, compared with 71% on tolterodine alone. Tolterodine was well tolerated; the most common adverse event was mild dry mouth. Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is an effective and well tolerated treatment for an overactive bladder, the effectiveness of which can be augmented by a simplified BT regimen.

Abstract 273 of 500

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessed the effects of epoetin alfa on transfusion requirements, hematopoietic parameters, quality of life (QOL), and safety in anemic cancer patients receiving nonplatinum chemotherapy. The study also explored a possible relationship between increased hemoglobin and survival. Three hundred seventy-five patients with solid or nonmyeloid hematologic malignancies and hemoglobin levels < or = 10.5 g/dL, or greater than 10.5 g/dL but < or = 12.0 g/dL after a hemoglobin decrease of > or = 1.5 g/dL per cycle since starting chemotherapy, were randomized 2:1 to epoetin alfa 150 to 300 IU/kg (n = 251) or placebo (n = 124) three times per week subcutaneously for 12 to 24 weeks. The primary end point was proportion of patients transfused; secondary end points were change in hemoglobin and QOL. The protocol was amended before unblinding to prospectively collect and assess survival data 12 months after the last patient completed the study. Epoetin alfa, compared with placebo, significantly decreased transfusion requirements (P =.0057) and increased hemoglobin (P <.001). Improvement of all primary cancer- and anemia-specific QOL domains, including energy level, ability to do daily activities, and fatigue, was significantly (P <.01) greater for epoetin alfa versus placebo patients. Although the study was not powered for survival as an end point, Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a trend in overall survival favoring epoetin alfa (P =.13, log-rank test), and Cox regression analysis showed an estimated hazards ratio of 1.309 (P =.052) favoring epoetin alfa. Adverse events were comparable between groups. Epoetin alfa safely and effectively ameliorates anemia and significantly improves QOL in cancer patients receiving nonplatinum chemotherapy. Encouraging results regarding increased survival warrant another trial designed to confirm these findings.

Abstract 274 of 500

Anecdotal evidence suggests patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are treated with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors at dosages significantly higher than those used with depressed patients. The current study examined the efficacy, safety, and optimal dosing strategy of sertraline in patients with OCD. Three hundred twenty-four nondepressed outpatients with OCD from 11 sites followed identical protocols using a double-blind parallel design. Following 1 week of single-blind placebo, patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with one of three fixed dosages of sertraline (50, 100, or 200 mg/d) or placebo. Sertraline patients exhibited significantly greater improvement (P < .05) at end point than placebo patients on all three main efficacy measures in the 50-mg/d and 200-mg/d groups and on one measure in the 100-mg/d group. The placebo response was larger in this population of subjects with OCD than in those previously studied. Adverse experiences were common in the sertraline and placebo groups and appeared to be dose-related in the sertraline-treated patients. Results support the safety and efficacy of daily dosages of 50, 100, and 200 mg of sertraline in the short-term treatment of patients with OCD.

Abstract 276 of 500

We compared the effect and toxicity of estramustine phosphate and weekly low-dose epirubicin in a prospective randomized trial in 41 patients with metastatic prostate cancer refractory to hormonal manipulation. No significant difference between treatment modalities was seen. Palliation was reached in over 60% of patients. The median survival was 15 months in both groups. Toxicity was mild. Further, we investigated the effect of epirubicin after the failure of preceding estramustine phosphate therapy in additional 20 patients. Pain relief was achieved in 50% of these patients. The median survival was 10 months. Toxicity was acceptable.

Abstract 278 of 500

Thiazolidinediones (TZD) have become a powerful tool for lowering insulin resistance. The problem of cardiovascular adverse events including fluid retention and risk of heart failure should be well known and recognised. We aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of rosiglitazone on cardiac function and fluid dynamics. Forty-six type 2 diabetic patients were randomised to treatment with rosiglitazone or metformin or to a control group. There are no significant differences between the groups in the duration of diabetes, HbA1c, plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, body mass index and myocardial performance indexes (MPIs) before the treatment. After three and six months all these parameters were repeated. Rosiglitazone increased plasma BNP levels and worsened MPIs 3 months after the start of treatment. Also left ventricular end-systolic volume increased and weight gain was observed. But these results were statistically non-significant (all p>0.05). When we continued rosiglitazone treatment to six months the increase in BNP levels became soft and statistically significant improvements were seen in MPIs (p<0.01). Also left ventricular end-systolic volume decreased significantly (p=0.004) and weight gain was stopped. In patients with type 2 diabetes, TZD treatment might have slight adverse effects on ventricular contractility and fluid dynamics at the beginning of the therapy. However, these changes seem to stabilise in the long term.

Abstract 279 of 500

Vagrant chronic schizophrenic subjects in a stable untreated state received in-patient treatment with either Flupenthixol decanoate or Clopenthixol decanoate. Both drugs were found to be significantly effective and well tolerated. The apparent better response to Flupenthixol decanoate was seen as dose-dependent. The findings and their implications for Community Psychiatry, particularly in developing countries are discussed.

Abstract 280 of 500

Maintaining abstinence from alcohol is the main goal in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Naltrexone (NTX) and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) have proved able to maintain alcohol abstinence in alcoholic subjects. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of GHB compared with NTX in maintaining abstinence from alcohol after 3 months of treatment. A total of 35 alcohol-dependent outpatients were randomly enrolled in two groups: the GHB group consisted of 18 patients treated with oral doses of GHB (50 mg/kg of body weight t.i.d) for 3 months; the NTX group consisted of 17 patients treated with oral doses of NTX (50 mg/day) for 3 months. At the end of the study, a statistically significant difference (P=0.02) was found in the number of abstinent patients between the GHB and the NTX groups. In patients who failed to be abstinent, no relapses in heavy drinking were observed in the NTX group, while in the GHB group all patients relapsed. The results of the present study show that GHB is more effective than NTX in maintaining abstinence from alcohol in a short-term treatment period; on the other hand, NTX confirmed its ability to reduce alcohol relapses.

Abstract 281 of 500

Prophylactic effects of psychotropic drugs on 55 schizophrenics in remission were evaluated for 3 years in a double-blind controlled study employing a cross-over design. Patients were randomly assigned to the following drugs orally administered twice a day: placebo; diazepam 15 mg; imipramine 50 mg; chlorpromazine 75 mg; and haloperidol 3 mg. The number of days of remission for each patient was recorded. Since only two patients received all five drug treatments, the data were analyzed using the number of days allocated to the "first assigned drugs" only and the cross-over aspect of the experimental design was disregarded. All patients treated with either the placebo, diazepam or imipramine relapsed within a year. On the other hand, four patients treated with chlorpromazine, or with haloperidol, were in remission for more than 1 year. Fifty percent of the patients relapsed within 16 days with placebo; 88 days with diazepam; 30 days with imipramine; 165 days with chlorpromazine; and 74 days with haloperidol. Within a year, only chlorpromazine significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to placebo and imipramine. At the end of the 3-year trial, both chlorpromazine and haloperidol significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to the other three drugs. These data suggest that neuroleptic treatment for a longer period is vitally important to prevent relapse even in schizophrenics in remission and that such a trial seems an efficient method for investigating the prophylactic effects of neuroleptics.

Abstract 282 of 500

A prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial was undertaken to determine whether two doses of systemic Timentin provided superior prophylaxis against postoperative sepsis in elective colorectal surgery compared with a single dose of the same antibiotic. Timentin, a combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid was administered intravenously (3.1 g) at the commencement of operation to all patients, and this was repeated after 2 hours in those patients randomized to receive a second dose. The wound infection rate was 11 percent in the 143 patients completing follow-up and receiving a single dose, and 13 percent in the 128 patients receiving two doses of Timentin (P greater than 0.05). The rates of postoperative septicemia 3 vs. 4 percent and intra-abdominal abscess 5 vs. 8 percent were similar. Multivariate analysis of the factors likely to affect postoperative would infection rate demonstrated an association with the type of hospital, public or private, wound infection rate 16 and 6 percent, respectively (P less than 0.01), and the surgeon group defined by the number of patients contributed greater than 25 or less than 25, wound infection rate 6 and 18 percent, respectively (P less than 0.05). We concluded that a single dose of intravenous Timentin was as effective as two doses for prophylaxis against surgical infection and that the surgeon group and the hospital in which the operation took place were statistically significant predictors of postoperative wound infection.

Abstract 283 of 500

A randomized study was made of 125 patients with chronic middle ear infection. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae. Ciprofloxacin is very active against the microorganisms usually isolated and it has been shown to provide effective therapy in ear infections. In order to study the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin in chronic otitis media, we selected four different treatment groups: oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg/12 h); 0.5 and 0.2% topical solutions of ciprofloxacin (3 drops/8 h), and oral ciprofloxacin plus 0.2% topical solution. Topical polymyxin and neomycin were used as controls. Topical ciprofloxacin (0.2%) was the most effective regimen of those tested for the treatment of chronic otitis media.

Abstract 284 of 500

The objective of the study was to assess the therapeutic effects of rosiglitazone in overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 30 (BMI > 25 kg/m2, mean age 29.1 +/- 1.2 years) overweight women with PCOS treated with rosiglitazone or placebo for 4 months. Waist-to-hip ratios (WHRs), serum concentrations of sex hormones and binding proteins, blood glucose, serum insulin and serum C-peptide during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), first-phase insulin secretion as determined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), M values (expressing insulin sensitivity using a euglycaemic clamp) and calorimetric data were assessed at 0 and 4 months of treatment. Rosiglitazone improved menstrual cyclicity, increased serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and decreased serum levels of androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S). Glucose tolerance [expressed as AUC(glucose) during the OGTT] improved (P = 0.002) and peripheral insulin response (expressed as AUC(insulin)) decreased (P = 0.004) in the rosiglitazone group (ROSI group). M value improved in the ROSI group from 33.4 +/- 3.27 to 40.0 +/- 5.51 micromol/kg min (P = 0.04). Rosiglitazone, by improving menstrual cyclicity, hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, represents an alternative treatment for overweight anovulatory women with PCOS and no pregnancy desire.

Abstract 285 of 500

Partial-thickness burns in children have been treated for many years by daily, painful tubbing, washing, and cleansing of the burn wound, followed by topical application of antimicrobial creams. Pain and impaired wound healing are the main problems. We hypothesized that the treatment of second-degree burns with Biobrane is superior to topical treatment. Twenty pediatric patients were prospectively randomized in two groups to compare the efficacy of Biobrane versus 1% silver sulfadiazine. The rest of the routine clinical protocols were followed in both groups. Demographic data, wound healing time, length of hospital stay, pain assessments and pain medication requirements, and infection were analyzed and compared. Main outcome measures included pain, pain medication requirements, wound healing time, length of hospital stay, and infection. The application of Biobrane to partial-thickness burns proved to be superior to the topical treatment. Patients included in the biosynthetic temporary cover group presented with less pain and required less pain medication. Length of hospital stay and wound healing time were also significantly shorter in the Biobrane group. None of the patients in either group presented with wound infection or needed skin autografting. In conclusion, the treatment of partial-thickness burns with Biobrane is superior to topical therapy with 1% silver sulfadiazine. Pain, pain medication requirements, wound healing time, and length of hospital stay are significantly reduced.

Abstract 286 of 500

To determine the efficacy and safety of combined L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine therapy in infertile males with oligoasthenozoospermia. One hundred fifty patients with oligoasthenozoospermia were randomized selected into treatment and control groups. The treatment group with 90 patients were given L-carnitine (2 g/d) and acetyl-L-carnitine (1 g/d) orally, twice a day. The patients in control group were given Vitamin E 100 mg plus Vitamin C 100 mg, tid. The oral therapy lasted three months and patients accepted sperm analysis every one month. The L-carnitine level in seminal plasma was examined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPC). Side effects as well as pregnant rate were observed. In the treatment group, 85 patients out of 90 finished the three month treatment. Female spouses of 10 patients (11.6%) achieved pregnancy. Moreover, their forward motile sperm per ejaculation, total motile sperm, as well as the concentration of L-carnitine in seminal plasma were increased significantly (P < 0.01). In control group, 53 patients out of 60 completed three months therapy. Two pregnancy (3.7%) was observed. Though some increase was seen in number of forward motile sperm and total motile sperm per ejaculation, the changes were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The difference of the pregnant rate between two groups was statistically significant. No side effects were found. Combined treatment with L-carnitine and acetyl-L-calmitine can be an effective and safe option for treating oligoasthenozoospermia by means of significantly improving forward motile sperm and total motile sperm per ejaculation, as well as increasing pregnant rates.

Abstract 287 of 500

To determine if vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has a protective effect on the hyperreactive airways of patients with exercise-induced asthma (EIA). All the patients underwent pulmonary function tests at rest, before and 1 hour after receiving 2 g of oral ascorbic acid. They were then randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive 2 g of ascorbic acid or a placebo 1 hour before a 7-minute exercise session on a treadmill. Pulmonary function tests were performed after an 8-minute rest. This procedure was repeated 1 week later, with each patient receiving the alternative medication. A university hospital. Twenty patients with asthma (13 males and 7 females), with ages ranging from 7 to 28 years (mean, 13.8 years). All patients who had a decline of at least 15% in their forced expiratory volume in 1 second after a standard exercise test on a motorized treadmill received a diagnosis of EIA. MAIN-OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients were advised to stop using their regular asthma medication or bronchodilator 12 hours before the test. Pulmonary function tests were performed in the same ambient conditions on all patients. All patients received a diagnosis of EIA. Ascorbic acid administration did not change the results of pulmonary functions at rest after 1 hour. In 9 patients, a protective effect on exercise-induced hyperreactive airways was documented. Four of 5 patients who received ascorbic acid and documented a protective effect on EIA continued to receive ascorbic acid, 0.5 g/d, for 2 more weeks with the same protective effect. The efficacy of vitamin C in preventing EIA cannot be predicted. However, vitamin C may have a protective effect on airway hyperreactivity in some patients with EIA.

Abstract 288 of 500

Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) has been put forward as the treatment of choice in women with clomiphene citrate (CC)-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with tubo-ovarian adhesion formation as the major disadvantage. Our study proposed to compare the efficacy of laparoscopic unilateral ovarian drilling with bilateral ovarian drilling in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rate with the expected advantage of decreasing postoperative adhesion rate and change in fimbiro ovarian relationship with unilateral drilling. This prospective randomized study included 44 patients with anovulatory infertility due to PCOS. Twenty-two patients underwent unilateral ovarian drilling in group-I and 22 patients underwent bilateral ovarian drilling in group-II between June 2005 and June 2007. The number of drilling site in each ovary was limited to five. The clinical and biochemical response, ovulation and pregnancy rates over a follow-up period of 1 year were compared. Tubo-ovarian adhesion rate was compared during cesarean section or during repeat laparoscopy. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of clinical and biochemical response, ovulation rate and pregnancy rate. Postoperatively, tubo-ovarian adhesions could be assessed in 36.3% of the patients and no adhesions were found in a single case in either group. Unilateral drilling cauterization of ovary is equally efficacious as bilateral drilling in inducing ovulation and achieving pregnancy. Unilateral ovarian drilling may be a suitable option in clomiphene citrate resistant infertility patient of PCOS which can replace bilateral ovarian drilling with the potential advantage of decreasing the chances of adhesion formation.

Abstract 289 of 500

From April 1987 to October 1992, 67 patients with inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region were included in a randomized trial. All patients had induction chemotherapy with cisplatin (100 mg/m2, D1) and fluorouracil (1 g/m2, from D1 to D5) every three weeks for a total of three cycles. Patients were randomized to concurrent external radiation therapy (70 Gy/39 fractions/8 weeks) and chemotherapy with cisplatin (50 mg/m2 in short infusion, D1, D15, D29, D43) and fluorouracil (5 mg/kg, intra-muscular, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday) (experimental group) versus radiotherapy alone with the same modalities (control group). The followup for living patients was 14 to 60 months with a median of 42 months. Analysis of preliminary results has shown that: 1) early and late side effects are similar in both groups; 2) after completion of treatment, the percentage of patients in complete remission was 71% (20/28) in the experimental group and 43% (12/28) in the control group; this difference was statistically significant among non responders to induction chemotherapy (1/15 versus 13/20, P = 0.001), but non significant among responders (11/13 versus 7/8) and 3) there were no differences between both randomized groups in term of 3-year overall survival and of 3-year loco-regional control. Results are discussed taking into account a review of literature.

Abstract 290 of 500

Obese patients with type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are at increased risk of development of cardiovascular diseases. Endothelial dysfunction may be a reason for development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Lifestyle modification, increased physical activity, weight reduction, energy restricted diet and good glycaemia control can be useful for the endothelial function improvement and may decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of basal insulin analog and metformin on glycaemia control and weight as risk factors of endothelial dysfunction. Total of 15 patients (9 male and 6 female) with type 2 diabetes were studied. The patients were monitored over six months period. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), and body mass index (BMI) were observed. Mean age of the subjects was 53,4 +/- 6,27 years. Mean diabetes duration was 3,71 +/- 1,89 years. At the end of the study mean body mass index decreased from 27,5 +/- 1,45 kg/m2 to 25,7 +/-1,22 kg/m2. In this study we included diabetic patients with fasting glycaemia over 7 mmol/dm3, postmeal glycaemia over 7,8 mmol/dm3 and glycated hemoglobin over 7%. Prior to the study, the patients were treated with premix insulin divided in two daily doses and metformin after the lunch, which did not result in sufficient regulation of glycaemia. We started treatment with one daily insulin basal analog and three daily doses of metformin and monitored the above mentioned parameters. We advised patients to change their lifestyle, to practice energy restricted diet and to increase their daily physical activity. Insulin doses were titrated separately for each patient (0,7-1 IU/kg). Weight reduction was recorded after the study. Mean fasting glycaemia decreased from 8,6+/-0,49 mmol/dm3 to 7,04+/-0,19 mmol/dm3 (p < 0,05). Mean postmeal glycaemia decreased from 9,74 +/- 0,79 mmol/dm3 to 7,6 +/- 0,43 mmol/dm3 (p<0,05). Mean HbA1c decreased from 8,80 +/- 0,59 % to 7,11 +/- 0,22 % (p<0,05). Treatment with one daily doses of basal insulin analog and three daily doses of metformin with lifestyle modification and weight reduction, in obese patients with type 2 diabetes can be useful for the endothelial function improvement and may decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract 291 of 500

Five fixed doses of the atypical antipsychotic "Seroquel" (quetiapine) were evaluated to delineate a dose-response relationship, as measured by changes from baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and Modified Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) summary scores, and to compare efficacy and tolerability opposite placebo and haloperidol. Three hundred sixty-one patients from 26 North American centers entered this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R). Patients who completed a single-blind, placebo washout phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with quetiapine (75, 150, 300, 600, or 750 mg daily), haloperidol (12 mg daily), or placebo and evaluated weekly for 6 weeks. At end point, significant differences (p < 0.05, analysis of covariance) in adjusted mean changes from baseline were identified between the four highest doses of quetiapine and placebo for BPRS total, BPRS positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores and between quetiapine 300 mg and placebo for SANS summary score. Differences between quetiapine and haloperidol were not significant. Dose-response modeling showed significant linear and quadratic functions of quetiapine dose for all primary efficacy variables. Notably, no significant safety concerns were identified as dose increased. Quetiapine was no different from placebo across the dose range studied regarding incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms or change in prolactin concentrations. Quetiapine is well tolerated and clinically effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is both superior to placebo and comparable to haloperidol in reducing positive symptoms at doses ranging from 150 to 750 mg/day and in reducing negative symptoms at a dose of 300 mg/day.

Abstract 292 of 500

The effects of low-dose doxapram (0.5 mg kg(-1)h(-1)) in combination with caffeine were evaluated on apnoea frequency following weaning from mechanical ventilation, and on blood pressure, in very low birthweight (BW) premature infants. Twenty-nine infants with BW < or=1250 g, gestational age at birth (GA) <34 weeks and postnatal age <5 d, who required minimal respiratory support, were included. Following randomization, they received a loading dose of caffeine citrate and a continuous infusion of doxapram (doxapram, n=14) or placebo (n=15) was started. They were extubated 8 h after starting the infusion, which was continued for 5 d. During this period, weaning was well tolerated in both groups, apnoeas occurred less frequently and there was a greater increase in systolic blood pressure in infants treated with doxapram than in controls. Plasma doxapram levels were also higher than expected. It is therefore suggested that doxapram, even at low doses, should not be used during the first few days of life. Careful monitoring of blood pressure is required if doxapram is used later.

Abstract 293 of 500

Tobacco cessation after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) substantially improves outcome but how effective individual programmes are needs to be established. To date, few studies have examined this factor. To assess the outcome of two smoking cessation programmes after AMI. One hundred and ninety-eight current smokers admitted to coronary care with an AMI participated in a randomized controlled study comparing two outpatient tobacco interventions, the Stanford Heart Attack Staying Free (SF) programme and a Usual Care (UC) programme. Log-rank analyses revealed that patients in the SF programme were retained longer (P < 0.001) and had higher cotinine validated abstinence rates (P < 0.001) compared with patients in the UC programme. Twelve months after intervention, 39% of the SF programme compared with 2% of the UC programme demonstrated cotinine validated tobacco cessation, representing a significant reduced relapse rate in the SF programme (chi2, P< 0.001). The SF smoking cessation programme initiated in hospital can significantly reduce smoking rates at 12 months after myocardial infarction. Although superior to the UC quit programme, Australian outcomes were lower than the American programme originators' published outcomes.

Abstract 294 of 500

We examined the effect of exercise training and detraining on bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Thirty-five postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, aged 53-77 years, were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group (n = 20), a 2-year exercise training group (n = 8), and an 1-year exercise training plus 1-year detraining group (n = 7). Exercise training consisted of daily brisk walking and gymnastic training. Calcium lactate, 2.0 g, and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1 microg were supplied daily to all subjects. No significant differences in initial lumbar BMD, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were found among the three groups. The mean percent change in BMD compared with the baseline was significantly higher at 1 and 2 years in the exercise training group and at 1 year in the detraining group than in the control group, and did not differ significantly at 2 years between the detraining and control groups. These findings indicate that our exercise training program led to a significant increase in lumbar BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis compared with the control, but that the BMD reverted toward a level that was not significantly different from the control with detraining. Continued exercise training is needed to maintain the bone mass gained through exercise training.

Abstract 295 of 500

To evaluate patterns of compliance with once versus twice daily administration of antihypertensive therapy (primary-outcome measure) and relevance of partial compliance for blood pressure control (secondary outcome measure). Multicentre, nonblinded, parallel group randomized design. Nonacademic primary care practices across Canada. Patients with mild essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 110 mmHg) of either sex (40% women), age 18 to 80 years (average 55 years). One hundred and ninety-eight patients were randomized to active treatment; 14 patients discontinued the study because of side effects. After a four-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to amlodipine 5 mg once-a-day or diltiazem slow release formulation (SR) 90 mg twice daily. Doses were increased to 10 mg and 180 mg to achieve sitting diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or less. During 20 weeks on active treatment, compliance was assessed by pill counts and medication event monitoring system (MEMS), assessing percentage of prescribed doses taken, percentage days correct doses taken, percentage prescribed doses taken on time and blood pressure control as determined by office blood pressure measurement. The percentage prescribed doses taken (by either pill count of MEMS) showed a high degree of compliance, similar for the two treatments. However, other parameters of compliance were significantly better with once versus twice daily therapy. Partial compliance (less than 80% by pill count) led to less blood pressure control with the short acting diltiazem, but did not affect blood pressure control for the long acting amlodipine. Side effects profiles did not differ between the two treatments. Within the constraints of a clinical trial, hypertensive patients in primary care show a high degree of overall compliance with once or twice daily pill-taking, but patterns of pill-taking are more erratic with twice versus once daily medication, particularly in men. The results suggest that the negative consequences of partial compliance for blood pressure control can be offset by choosing agents with a duration of action well beyond the dosing interval.

Abstract 296 of 500

This study, a phase III multicenter randomized trial opened by ECOG in April 1983 and closed in June 1986 was designed to evaluate whether a combination of doxorubicin and an intravenous formulation of diethylstilbestrol diphosphate (DES) was superior to doxorubicin alone in men with hormone refractory prostate cancer. All patients received doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg/m2 iv every 3 wk either alone or with 1 g DES iv daily for 5 d followed by 1 g iv twice weekly for four cycles (12 wk). The 51 evaluable patients with visceral metastases displayed a significantly increased response rate (27% vs 63%) on the combined therapy arm (p = 0.04). However, the 111 evaluable patients with osseous disease exhibited no difference in response rate between either arm with a p-value of >0.99. Similarly, clinical response rates revealed no difference between the two arms. Cases of cardiac toxicity graded as severe, life threatening, or lethal in the combined therapy arm were 10 times more frequent in the combined-therapy arm than in the doxorubicin-alone group (6.75% compared to 0.7%). This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0041). All of the cases of superficial and deep venous thrombosis occurred on the combined-therapy arm. There were no other significant differences in the numbers of grade 3 or 4 toxic events. The most common toxicity was hematologic. Failure-free survival duration did reach statistical significance in the combined-therapy group (p = 0.012), although the actual durations were short (2.6-3.2 mo). There was no difference in overall survival between the two groups.

Abstract 297 of 500

The genetic origin of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is not well understood. We used microarray profiling of peripheral blood monocytes to search novel genes and pathways involved in FCH. Fasting plasma for determination of lipid profiles, inflammatory molecules and adipokines was obtained and peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from male FCH patients basally and after 4 weeks of atorvastatin treatment. Sex-, age- and adiposity-matched controls were also studied. Gene-expression profiles were analyzed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 GeneChip arrays. Analysis of gene expression by cDNA microarrays showed that 82 genes were differentially expressed in FCH monocytes compared with controls. Atorvastatin treatment modified the expression of 86 genes. Pathway analysis revealed the over-representation of the complement and coagulation cascades, the hematopoietic cell lineage and the arachidonic acid metabolism pathways. Changes in the expression of some genes, confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, (CD36, leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains-1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2, myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 25, CD96 and lipoprotein lipase), may be related to a proinflammatory environment in FCH monocytes, which is partially reversed by atorvastatin. Higher plasma levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids and lower levels of adiponectin in FCH patients could also trigger changes in gene expression that atorvastatin cannot modify. Our results show clear differences in gene expression in FCH monocytes compared with those of matched healthy controls, some of which are influenced by atorvastatin treatment.

Abstract 298 of 500

Laryngoscopy and intubation evokes a transient but marked sympathetic response manifesting as increase in heart rate, blood pressure & arrhythmias. We conducted a study to compare the effect of different doses of gabapentin on hemodynamics associated with laryngoscopy and intubation. PATIENTS #ENTITYSTARTX00026; Ninety normotensive patients (ASA I and II) between 20-60 years undergoing elective surgery requiring intubation were randomly allocated into three groups of 30 patients each. Group I received oral placebo, Group II received 600 mg of gabapentin and Group III received1000 mg of gabapentin, with sip of water 1 h prior to surgery in the operation theatre. Patients were premedicated with Glycopyrrolate, midazolam and fentanyl and induction was done with thiopentone sodium and succinylcholine. Heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure were recorded at baseline, 0, 1, 3, 5 and 10 min after intubation. MAP and HR were significantly increased in patients receiving placebo and 600 mg gabapentin after laryngoscopy and intubation compared to baseline value and Group III. Significant decrease in MAP was seen just after intubation, 1, 3, 5 and 10 min after (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.05 and P < 0.05 respectively) in Group III compared to Groups I and II. HR was significantly decreased within 10 min of intubation (P<0.001)) in Group III compared to Groups I and II. Gabapentin1000 mg given 1 h before operation significantly attenuated the haemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation in normotensive patients.

Abstract 299 of 500

Homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We evaluated the efficacy of homocysteine-lowering treatment with B vitamins for secondary prevention in patients who had had an acute myocardial infarction. The trial included 3749 men and women who had had an acute myocardial infarction within seven days before randomization. Patients were randomly assigned, in a two-by-two factorial design, to receive one of the following four daily treatments: 0.8 mg of folic acid, 0.4 mg of vitamin B12, and 40 mg of vitamin B6; 0.8 mg of folic acid and 0.4 mg of vitamin B12; 40 mg of vitamin B6; or placebo. The primary end point during a median follow-up of 40 months was a composite of recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden death attributed to coronary artery disease. The mean total homocysteine level was lowered by 27 percent among patients given folic acid plus vitamin B12, but such treatment had no significant effect on the primary end point (risk ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.93 to 1.25; P=0.31). Also, treatment with vitamin B6 was not associated with any significant benefit with regard to the primary end point (relative risk of the primary end point, 1.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.32; P=0.09). In the group given folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6, there was a trend toward an increased risk (relative risk, 1.22; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.50; P=0.05). Treatment with B vitamins did not lower the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease after acute myocardial infarction. A harmful effect from combined B vitamin treatment was suggested. Such treatment should therefore not be recommended. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00266487.). Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society.

Abstract 300 of 500

On the basis of promising results that were reported in several phase 2 trials, we investigated whether the addition of the monoclonal antibody rituximab to first-line chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide would improve the outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Treatment-naive, physically fit patients (aged 30-81 years) with CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to receive six courses of intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m(2) per day) for the first 3 days of each 28-day treatment course with or without rituximab (375 mg/m(2) on day 0 of first course, and 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of second to sixth courses) in 190 centres in 11 countries. Investigators and patients were not masked to the computer-generated treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00281918. 408 patients were assigned to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (chemoimmunotherapy group) and 409 to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy group); all patients were analysed. At 3 years after randomisation, 65% of patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group were free of progression compared with 45% in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·56 [95% CI 0·46-0·69], p<0·0001); 87% were alive versus 83%, respectively (0·67 [0·48-0·92]; p=0·01). Chemoimmunotherapy was more frequently associated with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (136 [34%] of 404 vs 83 [21%] of 396; p<0·0001) and leucocytopenia (97 [24%] vs 48 [12%]; p<0·0001). Other side-effects, including severe infections, were not increased. There were eight (2%) treatment-related deaths in the chemoimmunotherapy group compared with ten (3%) in the chemotherapy group. Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab improves progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Moreover, the results suggest that the choice of a specific first-line treatment changes the natural course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. F Hoffmann-La Roche. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract 301 of 500

We studied the effects of tranexamic acid (an antifibrinolytic agent) and cimetidine on acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 775 patients with hematemesis or melena or both. Mortality was significantly reduced in patients receiving either tranexamic acid (mortality, 6.3 per cent) or cimetidine (7.7 per cent), as compared with patients receiving placebo (13.5 per cent) (P = 0.0092 for tranexamic acid vs. placebo, P = 0.045 for cimetidine vs. placebo). Ninety-nine patients were withdrawn before the code was broken, mainly because their primary illness was considered not to be due to acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding. Mortality among those withdrawn was high (22 per cent), and their exclusion reduced death rates to 4 per cent in those given tranexamic acid, 8 per cent in those given cimetidine, and 11 per cent in those given placebo (P = 0.0072 for tranexamic acid vs. placebo, P greater than 0.50 for cimetidine vs. placebo). The reduced mortality associated with tranexamic acid was detectable at both participating hospitals and in most of the main subgroups of patients classified according to site of bleeding. However, treatment with this agent was not associated with any decrease in the rate of rebleeding or the need for operation.

Abstract 302 of 500

Guidelines recommend daily controller therapy for mild persistent asthma. Montelukast has demonstrated consistent benefit in controlling symptoms of asthma and may be an alternative, orally administered, nonsteroidal agent for treating mild asthma. Aim: To determine whether montelukast is as effective as budesonide in controlling mild persistent asthma as determined by FEV(1). Between November 2003 to October 2005, participants aged 5-15 years with recently diagnosed mild persistent asthma (n = 62) were randomized to oral montelukast (5 mg daily) [N(1) = 30] or inhaled budesonide (400 microg per day in two doses) [N(2) = 32] in a single center, double-blind study. Baseline demographic and spirometric parameters were comparable. The median (95% confidence interval) percentage predicted FEV(1) was similar in the two groups after 12 weeks of treatment (budesonide: 76.70 (67.96-90.53%), montelukast: 75 (67.40-88.47)%; p = 0.44). There was similar improvement in spirometric parameters and clinical symptom scores in both the groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the need for rescue drugs as well as side effects reported by parents. Montelukast is as effective as inhaled budesonide in the treatment of mild persistent asthma in children aged 5-15 years. Montelukast may be used as an alternative to low dose inhaled corticosteroids for management of mild persistent asthma.

Abstract 303 of 500

This study compares the injecting and sexual risk-taking behaviour among injecting drug users (IDUs) currently, previously and never enrolled in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). All subjects had injected during the 6 months prior to the day of interview. The current MMT group showed significantly lower injecting risk-taking behaviour subscale scores on the HIV Risk-taking Behaviour Scale (HRBS) of the Opiate Treatment Index than the previous MMT and non-MMT groups together. The current MMT group differed from the other two groups in the frequency of injecting and cleaning of injection equipment with bleach. There was no difference between the current MMT group and the other two groups combined in sexual risk-taking behaviour scores on the HRBS. There were no differences between the previous MMT and non-MMT groups in injecting and sexual risk-taking behaviour. HIV seroprevalence was low and there was no difference in seroprevalence between groups. Thus, IDUs currently enrolled in MMT are at reduced risk for HIV infection when compared with IDUs who have previously or never been enrolled in MMT. However, the absence of a difference between the current MMT and other two groups in frequency of sharing behaviours suggests the need for additional strategies among MMT clients to reduce needle-sharing. Possible strategies include the application of relapse prevention interventions and the availability of sterile injecting equipment in MMT clinics. Further research is needed to identify factors which increase attraction and retention of IDUs to MMT.

Abstract 304 of 500

The clinical efficacy of flunarizine and propranolol for the prevention of migraine attacks was assessed in 33 children in a double blind study. After a run-in phase of one month, 32 patients started the active medication. A reduction in the number of migraine attacks was observed in 75% of the flunarizine group and in 73.8% of the propranolol group. Propranolol also reduced the severity of attacks. Transient side effects were observed in 3 of 17 of the flunarizine group and in 5 of 15 of the propranolol group. The most frequent side effect was increased fatigue, which required interruption of therapy in 2 patients of the propranolol group.

Abstract 305 of 500

Cryptococcal meningitis and other serious fungal infections are common complications in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fluconazole is effective for long-term suppression of many fungal infections, but its effectiveness as primary prophylaxis had not been adequately evaluated. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial that compared fluconazole (200 mg per day) with clotrimazole troches (10 mg taken five times daily) in patients who were also participating in a randomized trial of primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. After a median follow-up of 35 months, invasive fungal infections had developed in 4.1 percent of the patients in the fluconazole group (9 of 217) and in 10.9 percent of those in the clotrimazole group (23 of 211; relative hazard, as adjusted for the CD4+ count, 3.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 7.6). Of the 32 invasive fungal infections, 17 were cryptococcosis (2 in the fluconazole group and 15 in the clotrimazole group; adjusted relative hazard, 8.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 37.6). The benefit of fluconazole was greater for the patients with 50 or fewer CD4+ cells per cubic millimeter than for the patients with higher counts. Fluconazole was also effective in preventing esophageal candidiasis (adjusted relative hazard, 5.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 20.0; P = 0.004) and confirmed and presumed oropharyngeal candidiasis (5.7 and 38.1 cases per 100 years of follow-up in the fluconazole and clotrimazole groups, respectively; P < 0.001). Survival was similar in the two groups. Fluconazole taken prophylactically reduces the frequency of cryptococcosis, esophageal candidiasis, and superficial fungal infections in HIV-infected patients, especially those with 50 or fewer CD4+ lymphocytes per cubic millimeter, but the drug does not reduce overall mortality.

Abstract 306 of 500

Bisphosphonates have been widely administered to children with OI based on observational trials. A randomized controlled trial of q3m intravenous pamidronate in children with types III and IV OI yielded positive vertebral changes in DXA and geometry after 1 year of treatment, but no further significant improvement during extended treatment. The treated group did not experience significantly decreased pain or long bone fractures or have increased motor function or muscle strength. Bisphosphonates, antiresorptive drugs for osteoporosis, are widely administered to children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Uncontrolled pamidronate trials in OI reported increased BMD, vertebral coronal area, and mobility, and decreased pain. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of pamidronate in children with types III and IV OI. This randomized trial included 18 children (4-13 years of age) with types III and IV OI. The first study year was controlled; 9 children received pamidronate (10 mg/m2/day IV for 3 days every 3 months). Four children in each group also received recombinant growth hormone (rGH) injections (0.06 mg/kg/day for 6 days/week). Seven children in the treatment group received pamidronate for an additional 6-21 months. All patients had L1-L4 DXA, spine QCT, spine radiographs, and musculoskeletal and functional testing. In the controlled phase, treated patients experienced a significant increase in L1-L4 DXA z score (p < 0.001) and increased L1-L4 mid-vertebral height (p = 0.014) and total vertebral area (p = 0.003) compared with controls. During extended treatment, DXA z scores and vertebral heights and areas did not increase significantly beyond the 12-month values. Fracture rate decreased significantly in the upper extremities (p = 0.04) but not the lower extremities (p = 0.09) during the first year of treatment. Gross motor function, muscle strength, and pain did not change significantly during the controlled or extended treatment phases. A controlled trial confirmed the spine benefits of short-term pamidronate treatment in children with types III and IV OI. Pamidronate increased L1-L4 vertebral DXA and decreased vertebral compressions and upper extremity fractures. Vertebral measures did not improve during the extended treatment phase. The treatment group did not experience decreased lower extremity long bone fractures, significant improvement in growth, ambulation, muscle strength, or pain. There was substantial variability in individual response to treatment.

Abstract 308 of 500

The results of a randomised, prospective, multicentre trial of the management of primary open angle glaucoma are presented at up to five years' follow up. Previously undiagnosed cases were selected with intraocular pressure of 26 mmHg or more on two occasions together with field loss characteristic of glaucoma. Analysis was performed on one eye selected at random from each of 99 patients. Conventional medical treatment followed in unsuccessful cases by trabeculectomy (group A) was compared with trabeculectomy at diagnosis followed when necessary by supplementary medical therapy (group B). The life expectancy of these glaucoma patients was found to be similar to that for the local population matched for age and sex. In group A after four years trabeculectomy had been performed in 53% of eyes because medical management had failed to control the disease. The rate of operation was lower in those patients with intraocular pressure less than 31 mmHg and mild relative field loss (17% at three years) than in those with intraocular pressure greater than 30 mmHg and dense scotomas (75% at three years). Early surgery provided much more stable control with fewer changes in treatment than in group A. The group mean intraocular pressure after trabeculectomy was 15.0 mmHg irrespective of the time of operation, and this was significantly lower than the intraocular pressure in those cases thought to be controlled on medical therapy alone at the end of the first year (20.8 mmHg). Early operation provided significantly better protection of visual field, and the extra loss of visual field with delayed operation occurred in the preoperative period. Changes in visual fields were not related to the use of miotics. There was no significant difference in the final visual acuity in the two groups, but six cases in group A lost central fixation because of progressive loss of visual field, and there were no such cases in group B. Cataract occurred in approximately 10% of cases in both groups, but in group A this happened with only half the number of operations and at a shorter postoperative follow-up than in group B. It appears that in cases of primary open angle glaucoma of this severity the risk of delaying operation are significantly greater than those of performing trabeculectomy as the primary treatment.

Abstract 309 of 500

Almitrine stimulates breathing by activating peripheral chemoreceptors and was given orally in a dose of 200 mg/day to nine patients with sleep apnoea syndrome, after a single blind placebo sequence. No reduction in the number of respiratory events per hour of sleep was observed. On the other hand Almitrine led to a significant fall in the mean duration of respiratory events (p less than 0.02). This fall occurred principally in the obstructive apnoea group and in those with mixed apnoea only during light slow wave sleep. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the arousal response to hypoxia mediated by the chemoreceptors could be responsible for the termination of sleep apneas.

Abstract 311 of 500

In a single-dose, parallel group, randomized block treatment allocation study, the relative analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, was compared to acetaminophen 650 mg with codeine 60 mg, zomepirac sodium 100 mg, and placebo. A total of 226 post-surgical dental patients (146 females and 80 males) participated in the study. Flurbiprofen in 50 mg and 100 mg dosages demonstrated effective analgesic activity with the 100 mg dosage being at least as effective as the acetaminophen/codeine combination. The results of this study support previous work on flurbiprofen.

Abstract 312 of 500

To evaluate the effectiveness of personal protective measures of health care workers (HCWs) against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A case-control study from ten hospitals in Guangdong, with 180 non-infected and 77 infected staff members that accessed the isolation unit every day, and participated in direct first aid for severe SARS patients. All participants were surveyed about how they were using personal protective equipment (PPE), protective drugs and hygiene habits when caring for patients with SARS. Statistical analysis was done with either chi(2) or Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis, whereas we used forward stepwise selection (Waldesian) for logistic regression. Univariate analysis showed that mask, gown, gloves, goggles, footwear, "hand-washing and disinfecting", gargle, "membrane protection", "taking shower and changing clothing after work", "avoid from eating and drinking in ward", oseltamivir phospha tall had protective effects (P < 0.05), but stepwise logistic regression showed significant differences for mask (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.60 - 0.99), goggles (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10 - 0.41) and footwear (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.39 - 0.86). Analysis for linear trend in proportions showed that dose response relationship existed in mask, gown, gloves, goggles, footwear, gargle, "membrane protection" and "taking shower and changing dree after work" (P < 0.01). The attack rate of HCWs who were rescuing severe SARS patients without any PPE was 61.5% (16/26). It seemed that the more the protective measures were used, the higher the protective effect was (P < 0.001), and could reach 100% if mask, gown, gloves, goggles, footwear, "hand-washing and disinfecting" were all used at the same time. Nosocomial infection of SARS can be prevented effectively by precautions against droplets and personal contact. HCWs must take strict protection according to the guidance of WHO or Chinese MOH and pay attention to personal hygiene.

Abstract 314 of 500

Salmeterol may be useful in the treatment of asthmatic patients requiring high-dose inhaled steroids, and there have been debates about its anti-inflammatory action. We have compared the efficacy and effects on serum inflammatory markers, including soluble interleukin 2R (sIL-2R), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and tryptase of salmeterol and albuterol in 20 patients with moderate to severe asthma who were all receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled beta 2-agonist on demand. After a 2-week run-in period, they received, in a randomized, crossover, double-blind and placebo-controlled manner, either salmeterol, 50 micrograms twice a day, or albuterol 400 micrograms, four times a day, from a powder inhaler during two 2-week treatment periods, separated by a 2-week washout. Compared with albuterol, salmeterol treatment was associated with better morning and mean peak expiratory flow (p = 0.013 and 0.016, respectively), less daytime and nocturnal symptoms (p = 0.008 and 0.01, respectively), reduced requirement of rescue albuterol (p = 0.04), and better efficacy rating by patients (p = 0.04). However, serum concentration of sIL-2R was significantly higher during regular albuterol treatment (p = 0.014) but no differences were seen in the concentrations of ECP and tryptase between the two treatment periods. We conclude that inhaled salmeterol, 50 micrograms twice daily, confers a better control of asthma than albuterol, 400 micrograms four times daily, in patients with moderate to severe disease, and the latter treatment may be associated with increased T-lymphocyte activation.

Abstract 315 of 500

To prove that low-dose hCG alone can be clinically used to replace FSH-containing gonadotropins to complete controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Controlled, prospective, randomized study. Academic center. Infertile patients who are candidates for assisted reproduction. Patients received [1] recombinant FSH or hMG throughout COH (group A); [2] ovarian priming with recombinant FSH/hMG followed by low-dose hCG (200 IU/day) alone (group B). Medication consumption; daily serum and follicular fluid (FF) measurements of LH, FSH, hCG, E2, P, T, and androstenedione (A); number and size of follicles; intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) outcome. In group B: [1] duration and dose of recombinant FSH/hMG administration were reduced; [2] preovulatory serum hCG, E2, and T were higher, whereas FSH was lower; [3] FF hCG, E2, T levels, and E2/T, E2/A, and E2/P ratios were higher, whereas A was lower; [4] small but not large preovulatory follicles were reduced; [5] fertilization rates were higher; and [6] serum and FF P levels, and ICSI outcome did not differ. Low-dose hCG alone in the late COH stages: [1] reduced recombinant FSH/hMG consumption whereas ICSI outcome was comparable to traditional COH regimens; [2] stimulated follicle growth and maturation independent of FSH administration; [3] was associated with a reduced number of small preovulatory follicles; [4] did not cause premature luteinization; [5] resulted in a more estrogenic intrafollicular environment.

Abstract 317 of 500

The cardiovascular effects of dopamine were evaluated in 14 severely asphyxiated neonates. After a period of stabilization, either dopamine 2.5 micrograms/kg/minute or placebo was infused in a randomized double-blind protocol. In seven dopamine-treated infants, echocardiographically determined shortening fraction and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening increased when compared to preinfusion values (P less than 0.05). There was no significant change in these echo indices of cardiac function in the placebo-treated group. Systolic blood pressure rose in the dopamine group when compared to predopamine infusion values and to the postinfusion values of the placebo group (P less than 0.001 and 0.025, respectively). Diastolic blood pressure increased to a small degree in the dopamine group. There was no significant change in heart rate or echocardiographically measured systolic time intervals. Low doses of dopamine increase cardiac performance and raise systolic blood pressure in the severely asphyxiated neonate.

Abstract 318 of 500

A pretest-posttest control group design with two posttests was used to evaluate the effects of a regional Dutch Heart Health Community Intervention on smoking behaviour and its determinants. At baseline, a cohort research population of 1,200 smokers was recruited in the intervention region and in a control region. Data was gathered by means of short structured telephone interviews. No significant differences were found between the intervention region and the control region on smoking behaviour and its determinants. It is concluded that the regional intervention was unable to exceed secular trends in smoking cessation.

Abstract 320 of 500

To compare the long-term effects of finasteride (5 mg/day) and placebo in patients with moderate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Patients aged 50 to 75 years, with at least two urinary symptoms indicating moderate BPH, and an enlarged prostate, were followed in a 2-year double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study. The effects of finasteride versus placebo were assessed by total symptom score (modified Boyarsky), obstructive symptom score, maximal urinary flow rate, prostate volume, and urologic end points (acute urinary retention, BPH-related surgical intervention). Of the 3270 men enrolled, 3168 contributed data to the safety analysis, and 2902 to the efficacy evaluation. Significantly greater improvement with finasteride compared to placebo was observed at 12 and 24 months for total symptom score (mean -2.9 versus -1.9 at 12 months, P < or =0.001; -3.2 versus -1.5 at 24 months, P < or =0.001), obstructive symptom score (mean -1.9 versus -1.3 at 12 months, P < or =0.001; -2.1 versus -1.1 at 24 months, P < or =0.001), maximal urinary flow rate (mean +1.2 versus +0.6 mL/s at 12 months, P = 0.010; +1.5 versus +0.7 mL/s at 24 months, P = 0.002), and prostate volume (mean -14.2 versus +5.4% at 12 months, P < or =0.01; -15.3 versus +8.9% at 24 months, P < or =0.001). Greater improvements in placebo-adjusted total symptom score occurred in men with large prostates than in men with small prostates (mean -2.4 versus -1.1 at 12 months; -3.2 versus -1.3 at 24 months, placebo-adjusted data, P = 0.053). Fifteen of 1450 men (1.0%) in the finasteride group experienced an acute urinary retention event, compared with 37 of 1452 (2.5%) in the placebo group, and the corresponding figures for surgery were 51 of 1450 (3.5%) and 86 of 1452 (5.9%), respectively. The hazard rate for occurrence, computed using the log-rank statistic, decreased by 57% for acute urinary retention and by 40% for surgery accompanied by finasteride therapy compared to placebo. Finasteride causes long-term symptomatic improvement and reduces the risk of acute urinary retention or surgery. Men with enlarged prostates benefit most from finasteride treatment.

Abstract 321 of 500

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) followed by irradiation with incoherent light (ALA-PDT) for recalcitrant warts have had beneficial results. Therefore, we undertook a randomised, parallel, double-blind clinical trial of ALA-PDT versus placeboPDT for recalcitrant foot and hand warts. Recalcitrant foot and hand warts were randomly assigned to six repetitive ALA-PDT or placebo-PDT interventions combined with standard treatment encompassing paring followed by a keratolytic (Verucid). Standardised photographs of each wart were taken before, during (week 7) and after treatment (weeks 14 and 18). The area of each wart compared with entry area was the primary outcome variable, measured from photographs by an evaluator unaware of treatment allocation for intervention. Pain intensity immediately and 24 h after each intervention was assessed by a five-point scale. A total of 232 foot and hand warts in 45 patients were entered into the trial: 117 warts were allocated to ALA-PDT and 115 warts to placebo-PDT. In week 14, the median relative reduction in wart area was 98% in the ALA-PDT group (interquartile range 100%, 55%) versus 52% (100%, 0) in the placebo group (p=0.0006). In week 18, the median relative reduction in wart area was 100% in the ALA-PDT group (100%, 57%) versus 71% (100%, 0) in the placebo-PDT arm (p=0.008). Both the number of vanishing warts and the difference in relative wart area of persisting warts at week 14 and 18 were significant (p<0.05) in favour of ALA-PDT. Significantly more ALA-PDT warts were graded at a higher pain intensity after treatment than placebo-PDT warts. ALA-PDT is superior to placebo-PDT when both wart area and number of vanishing warts are considered.

Abstract 322 of 500

New lesions recur within weeks to months after ileal resection and ileocolonic anastomosis for Crohn's ileitis. A double-blind controlled trial was performed using metronidazole to prevent recurrence after ileal resection. Sixty patients who underwent curative ileal resection and primary anastomosis were included within 1 week after surgery. Thirty patients received metronidazole (20 mg/kg body wt) daily for 3 months, and 30 patients received placebo. Treatment was then discontinued. Nine patients dropped out during treatment, 7 in the metronidazole group and 2 in the placebo arm. At 12 weeks, 21 of 28 patients (75%) in the placebo group had recurrent lesions in the neoterminal ileum as compared with 12 of 23 patients (52%) in the metronidazole group (P = 0.09). The incidence of severe endoscopic recurrence was significantly reduced by metronidazole (3 of 23; 13%) as compared with placebo (12 of 28; 43%; P = 0.02). Patients in the metronidazole arm had more frequent side effects. Metronidazole therapy statistically reduced the clinical recurrence rates at 1 year (4% vs. 25%). Reductions at 2 years (26% vs. 43%) and 3 years (30% vs. 50%) were not significant. Metronidazole therapy for 3 months decreases the severity of early recurrence of Crohn's disease in the neoterminal ileum after resection and seems to delay symptomatic recurrence.

Abstract 323 of 500

A prospective randomized clinical study was performed in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. The purpose of the study was to determine the activity of high doses of 5-fluorouracil and epirubicin (FE) vs. the same combination + cisplatin (FEP), and particularly the value of cisplatin in the combination. A total of 122 patients was included in the study; 110 of them were assessable. In the FE arm, the treatment involved 1000 mg/m2 in a 6-hr infusion of 5-fluorouracil on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and 120 mg/m2 of epirubicin i.v. on day 1. In the FEP arm, the same combination of cytostatics + cisplatin (30 mg/m2) was administered on days 2 and 4. The cycles were repeated after 4 weeks. Altogether, 468 cycles of chemotherapy were given (FE, 240; FEP, 228). In the FE arm, 56 patients were assessable, with 2 complete and 14 partial remissions (28.6%); in the FEP arm, 4 complete and 19 partial remissions (42.6%) were observed in 54 assessable patients. Median survival in the FE group was 7.1 months and in the FEP group 9.6 months. The survival difference was statistically significant (Cox's test, P<0.05). The most frequent side effects included grade 2 and 3 alopecia (FE, 93%; FEP, 94%) and grade 2 and 3 vomiting (FE, 20%; FEP, 35%). Grade 3 and 4 leukopenia was observed in 9% of patients in the FE group and in 13% of patients in the FEP group, with 6 cases of febrile neutropenia (FE, 4%; FEP, 7%). Stenocardia was registered in 1 patient in the FE group and in 2 patients in the FEP group. No treatment-related death was registered. The addition of cisplatin to high doses of 5-fluorouracil and epirubicin resulted in a statistically significant better survival of treated patients.

Abstract 324 of 500

Forty-eight patients in a programme of intrauterine insemination (IUI) were randomized in a cross-over study. All were stimulated with clomiphene citrate (CC) and inseminated either after follicular rupture induced by human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) or after a spontaneous urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. The HCG was administered when follicles of 18-22 mm in diameter were observed on ultrasound and IUI was performed 37-40 h thereafter. The monitoring of a urinary LH peak was carried out using a rapid urinary LH test. IUI took place approximately 22 h after detection of the LH surge. Overall, the pregnancy rates were 9.3% (4/43) after HCG induced ovulation and 20.5% (9/44) after spontaneous ovulation (P = 0.12). Analysis of mid-cycle events showed that following sonographic criteria, the HCG injection was performed significantly earlier in the cycle compared with the spontaneous LH surge. In addition, the mean diameter of the preovulatory follicles was significantly smaller and insemination was substantially earlier in the HCG induced cycles. These findings suggest that a beneficial effect arises from allowing the natural process of final follicular maturation to occur.

Abstract 325 of 500

ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may favorably affect serum lipids and glucose metabolism. The primary aim of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were assessed as secondary outcomes. Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of NIDDM and hypertension (systolic blood pressure of > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mmHg). Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics. A total of 380 hypertensive diabetics were randomly assigned to open-label fosinopril (20 mg/day) or amlodipine (10 mg/day) and followed for up to 3.5 years. If blood pressure was not controlled, the other study drug was added. Both treatments were effective in lowering blood pressure. At the end of follow-up, between the two groups there was no significant difference in total serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, or plasma insulin. The patients receiving fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of the combined outcome of acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalized angina than those receiving amlodipine (14/189 vs. 27/191; hazards ratio = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.26-0.95). Fosinopril and amlodipine had similar effects on biochemical measures, but the patients randomized to fosinopril had a significantly lower risk of major vascular events, compared with the patients randomized to amlodipine.

Abstract 326 of 500

Twenty-two primary total knee arthroplasties were prospectively randomized into one of two treatment protocols. Ten of these patients were managed in the hospital after surgery by means of a postoperative splint. The remaining 12 patients were placed immediately postoperatively in the recovery room into the continuous passive motion (CPM) device. The study compares the range of motion, analgesic use, hospital stay, and the volume of hemovac output in the two groups. These cases demonstrated two statistically significant findings with the use of CPM: (1) decreased use of narcotic analgesics and (2) decreased length of hospital stay.

Abstract 327 of 500

748 children with severe pneumonia in three hospitals in Papua New Guinea were randomised to receive intramuscular injections of either chloramphenicol alone or chloramphenicol plus penicillin. Sequential analysis showed no difference between the two treatments. 48 (13%) of the 377 children in the chloramphenicol alone group died, and 3 (0.8%) were changed to different treatment. 62 (17%) of the 371 children in the chloramphenicol-plus-penicillin group died, and 6 (1.6%) were changed to different treatment. The difference in failure rates (death or withdrawal for change of treatment) was 4.8% +/- 5.2% (+/- 95% confidence limits). In children with severe pneumonia, treatment with chloramphenicol alone is as effective as treatment with chloramphenicol plus penicillin.

Abstract 328 of 500

This research estimated the costs and effectiveness of three different benefit designs for treating tobacco dependence: drugs only (nicotine replacement therapy patch, nasal spray, inhaler, and Zyban); drugs and counseling (drugs and proactive telephone counseling); and drugs if counseling (drugs conditional on enrollment in counseling). A sample of 393 adult smokers enrolled in a California preferred provider organization was randomly assigned to one of three study groups. After eight months, there were no significant increases in quit attempts or quit rates in the groups with covered drugs and counseling compared to the group with drug coverage only. Therefore, costs rose with no increase in quit rates when proactive telephone counseling was added to coverage of pharmacotherapy, regardless of benefit design.

Abstract 329 of 500

This multicenter, open-label, third-party-masked trial compared the efficacy and safety of itraconazole oral solution (200 mg once daily) and clotrimazole troches (10 mg five times daily) in a population of immunocompromised subjects composed primarily of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients were treated for 14 days; patients who exhibited a clinical response were followed up for an additional month to document the occurrence of relapse. Efficacy was judged by changes from baseline in symptoms of oropharyngeal candidiasis (erythema, soreness/burning), extent of oral lesions, and the presence/absence of Candida species on fungal culture. A total of 162 patients were randomized, and 149 were evaluated for efficacy. The percentage of patients with negative cultures at the end of treatment was significantly greater in the itraconazole group than in the clotrimazole group (60% vs 32%, respectively). Negative culture plus clinical response was achieved in significantly more itraconazole-treated patients (53%) than clotrimazole-treated patients (30%); results were similar in the subgroup of patients with HIV/AIDS. Both drugs were well tolerated, with the most frequently reported adverse events for both agents involving the gastrointestinal system. In conclusion, systemic therapy with intraconazole oral solution is efficacious and well tolerated in immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV/AIDS, when administered once daily for 14 days for the treatment of oral candidiasis.

Abstract 330 of 500

This prospective randomized study aims at evaluation and comparison of the prophylactic effects of amiodarone versus digoxin and metoprolol combination in postcoronary bypass atrial fibrillation. A total of 241 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly allocated into three groups. Patients in Group1 (n=77) received metoprolol 100 mg/24 h per oral (P.O.), preoperatively, 2x0.5 mg digoxin intravenously on the operating day and digoxin 0.25 mg P.O.+metoprolol 100 mg P.O. on the first postoperative day until discharge. Patients in Group 2 (n=72) received totally 1200 mg intravenous/24 h amiodarone which the 300 mg - bolus dose/1 h was given as soon as the operation had been finished. On the next day patients were administered 450 mg/24 h amiodarone i.v. and 600 mg/day in three doses P.O. were given until discharge. Group 3 (n=92) was the control group with no antiarrhythmic prophylaxis. Preoperative patient characteristics and operative parameters were similar in three groups. Atrial fibrillation occurred in 13 patients (16.8%) in Group 1, six patients (8.3%) in Group 2 and 31 patients (33.6%) in Group 3. Both study groups were effective in the prevention of postcoronary bypass atrial fibrillation with respect to control (P<0.01 in Group 1 and P<0.001 in Group 2).

Abstract 331 of 500

A direct comparison of the analgesic activities of heroin and hydromorphone was carried out in cancer patients with postsurgical pain. Intramuscular doses of 5 and 10 mg of heroin were compared with 1 and 2 mg of hydromorphone in a randomized, double-blind, 4-point parallel group assay. Design innovations in the study provided that about half the patients would receive prior repeated doses of the same drug as the test medication, and half would receive the alternate medication. Both test drugs were found to be potent, relatively short acting analgesics with similar profiles of action. Hydromorphone was about 5 times as potent as heroin on a milligram basis. The comparison of those patients who had repeated doses of the same treatment prior to the test dose and those who had repeated doses of the alternate drug demonstrated no significant effect on the relative potency estimates. Side effect occurrence was similar for both drugs, with sleepiness the most prominent effect. The study supports the view that hydromorphone and heroin produce similar clinical effects, and that either drug may adequately substitute for the other. Covariate analysis indicated that time since last analgesic was positively related to analgesia, and amount of prior opioid had a negative relationship. To a lesser extent, increase in patient age was associated with an increase in analgesic scores. Taking these covariates into account served to increase the sensitivity of the analysis.

Abstract 332 of 500

The effect of supplementing 11,918 infants < 1 mo and 1-5 mo of age with vitamin A (15,000 and 30,000 micrograms retinol equivalents or 50,000 and 100,000 IU, respectively) or a placebo on subsequent 4-mo mortality was assessed in a randomized, double-masked community trial in the rural plains of Nepal. There were 130 deaths (51.6/1000 child-y) in the control group and 150 deaths (57.1/1000 child-y) in the vitamin A group, yielding a relative risk of 1.11 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.42), which is indicative of no overall effect on early infant mortality. There was a tendency for the relative risk of mortality among vitamin A recipients to rise with improved nutritional status. These results suggest that distribution of a large oral dose of vitamin A to infants < 5-6 mo of age may not benefit short-term survival. This is in contrast with the results of trials in which older infants and children in this same population were supplemented.

Abstract 333 of 500

The goal of this study was to compare the effects of 1, 3 and 8 mg per day doses of buprenorphine in the maintenance treatment of opium-dependent subjects in Iran over a treatment period of 12 months. Participants were randomized to three equal groups (171 subjects per group) of opium-dependent individuals who met the DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence and were seeking treatment. They were treated in an urban outpatient clinic, offering a 1-hour weekly individual counseling session. Overall, 282 subjects (55%) completed the 12 months study. Completion rates by dosage group were 46 (26.9%) for the 1 mg dose group, 102 (59.6%) for the 3 mg dose group, and 134 (78.4%) for the 8 mg dose group (p =.000). These findings are consistent with previous reports of effective buprenorphine use in western countries as a suitable maintenance treatment for opium dependence.

Abstract 334 of 500

One hundred and thirty-one male and female outpatients, aged 18-70 yr, with acute pain in the ankle joint caused by a post-traumatic sprain, entered a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, study. The patients were assigned to a 40 mg flurbiprofen patch (n = 65) or a non-medicated (but otherwise identical) control (n = 66), 12-hourly over 7 days, and were assessed at entry and after 3 and 7 days treatment. On day 7, spontaneous pain (the prime efficacy parameter), as evaluated by the patient on a visual analogue scale in the physician's office, showed significant improvement in the 40 mg flurbiprofen patch group compared to control (change from baseline) (p = 0.039), a result corroborated by the evaluation of the periarticular oedema: a reduction of 77.4% was observed in the 40 mg flurbiprofen patch group, compared with 63.8% in the control group (p = 0.025). The other selected efficacy criteria showed changes with a trend in favour of the 40 mg flurbiprofen patch but without statistical significance. Two mild and local adverse events were reported by two flurbiprofen patch patients, but neither patients discontinued the treatment prematurely. Physicians and patients found the flurbiprofen patch to be efficacious and well tolerated. Compliance was excellent in both groups. The efficacy and tolerability of the 40 mg flurbiprofen patch are therefore confirmed in the treatment of acute ankle sprains.

Abstract 335 of 500

Pramipexole, a non-ergot dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist, was investigated as an add on drug in advanced parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerance. Seventy eight patients of either sex with advanced Parkinson's disease and treatment complications such as motor fluctuations were enrolled into a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised, multicentre study (phase II) and assigned to add on treatment with pramipexole (n=34) versus placebo (n=44) to a previously stabilised antiparkinsonian medication (7 week dose titration interval, 4 week maintenance period). The primary end point of efficacy was the change from baseline in the total score of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) in the on "period" (2 hours after intake of study medication). Safety and tolerability were assessed on the basis of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory measurements, and ECG recordings. There was a significant improvement of the pramipexole group in UPDRS total scores, subscores part II, III (activities of daily living and motor examination), and IV (complications of therapy). Mean UPDRS total score decreased by 37.3% under pramipexole compared with 12.2% under placebo (p<0.001). Patients under pramipexole reported an overall reduction in "off" periods of 12%--resulting in 1.7 more hours "on" time a day--compared with an increase in "off" periods of 2% under placebo. There were no unexpected safety results. The adverse event profile disclosed a high tolerability. The most important adverse events under pramipexole were fatigue, dyskinesia, and vivid dreams. Pramipexole administration is an efficacious and well tolerated add on therapy in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with an improvement in activities of daily living, motor function, and treatment associated complications.

Abstract 336 of 500

This randomized, multicenter, open-label study compared the efficacy and safety of monotherapy with 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone once daily for 4 weeks with those of combination therapy with 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone and 3 mg of intravenous gentamicin/kg once daily for 2 weeks as therapy for endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible streptococci. Sixty-one patients were enrolled in the study. Clinical cure was observed for 51 evaluable patients both at termination of therapy and at the 3-month follow-up: 25 (96.2%) of 26 monotherapy recipients and 24 (96%) of 25 combination therapy recipients. Of the 23 patients in each treatment group who were microbiologically evaluable, 22 (95.7%) in each group were considered cured. No patient had evidence of relapse. Fourteen patients (27.5%) required cardiac surgery after initiation of treatment, including five monotherapy recipients and nine combination therapy recipients. Adverse effects were minimal in both treatment groups. We conclude that 2 g of ceftriaxone once daily for 4 weeks and 2 g of ceftriaxone in combination with 3 mg of gentamicin/kg once daily for 2 weeks are both effective and safe for the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis.

Abstract 337 of 500

Our randomized, placebo-controlled supplementation study of 160 rural Gambian children aged 8.3-11.9 y showed that an increase in calcium intake of 714 mg/d for 12 mo resulted in a 5% increase in forearm bone mineral acquisition and a 22% decrease in plasma osteocalcin concentration, a bone formation marker, but had no effect on height or bone dimensions. We investigated whether these results were sustained after supplement withdrawal. All participants were followed up 12 (FU1) and 24 (FU2) mo after supplementation ended. Bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), and BMC adjusted for bone width, body weight, and height (size-adjusted BMC) were measured at the midshaft and distal radius. Plasma osteocalcin concentration was measured at FU1. At follow-up, the calcium group had greater bone mineral status than did the placebo group at the midshaft radius (mean difference +/- SE), FU1: BMC (4.7 +/- 1.6%; P = 0.004), BMD (5.1 +/- 1.1%; P </= 0.0001), size-adjusted BMC (5.0 +/- 1.1%; P </= 0.0001); FU2: BMC (3.8 +/- 1.6%; P = 0.02), BMD (2.7 +/- 1.3%; P = 0.04), size-adjusted BMC (2.5 +/- 1.3%; P = 0.06). Similar differentials were observed at the distal radius but were not significant. No significant differences in plasma osteocalcin concentrations (FU1: -0.5 +/- 6.5%; P = 0.9) were observed between groups. Although some of the effects of calcium supplementation were still evident at follow-up, further studies are required to determine whether short-term increases in calcium intake have lasting benefits for Gambian children.

Abstract 338 of 500

We conducted a double-blind trial of high-dose parenteral 6-methylprednisolone (MP) and placebo on 23 patients with acute MS. After the double-blind trial, the patients were given corticosteroids in gradually decreasing doses. The frequency of improvement was significantly higher and the bout duration significantly lower in the MP group than in the placebo group. The first signs of improvement (3 to 6 days after starting MP) were associated with a marked decrease in the rate of CNS IgG synthesis, but IgG CSF oligoclonal bands did not change. CNS IgG production slowly returned toward baseline despite progressive clinical improvement.

Abstract 339 of 500

The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) is a multistate field trial examining the effects of school environment, classroom curricula, and family intervention components in promoting the cardiovascular health of elementary school students. The purpose of this paper is to describe the CATCH tobacco use intervention and measurement, including the adoption of tobacco-free school policies. In this study, changes in school tobacco use policies and smoking experimentation among students were assessed. Smoking experimentation was measured in all CATCH schools when the students were in their fifth-grade year. A total of 6,527 subjects in 96 schools in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas answered questions about behaviors and potential correlates of smoking as part of the CATCH health behavior questionnaire in Spring 1994. School tobacco use policy, an important complement to classroom- and home-based prevention efforts, was promoted as part of the CATCH intervention. The degree to which such policy was implemented was measured using surveys of school officials. At the end of fifth grade, only 4.8% of the subjects indicated that they had experimented with tobacco. School intervention condition was not a factor in the prediction of experimentation. Those whose best friend or sibling smoked, or who had ready access to cigarettes in the home, were more likely to have experimented with smoking. In the 3 years of the study, the percentages of tobacco-free schools went up from 49.7 to 76.8%. Though differences in the rate of policy adoption could not be directly attributed to the CATCH intervention, the implementation of the tobacco-free schools' policies did vary substantially from state to state. Minnesota and Texas, with stronger state laws supporting local policy, had nearly completely smoke-free schools. In spite of a statewide tobacco control initiative, California was slower to implement school policies. Louisiana, which allows local decision making regarding smoking policy, had the most difficulty establishing a policy for all districts. Future studies should examine the impact of parallel policy interventions that are ongoing at both school and state levels. Tobacco-free policies appear to be a crucial part of school-based interventions and must be tailored to political and regional factors affecting a given school district.

Abstract 340 of 500

The pharmacokinetic profile of total and free methotrexate (MTX) and the effect of piroxicam on MTX pharmacokinetics was studied in 20 rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving a stable dosage of MTX (10 mg/week). Plasma protein binding ranged from 25 to 55%. To describe the variations with time of the unbound fractions a mathematical characterization relationship between the total and free MTX was used. Total and free MTX were correlated with the sigmoid maximum effect model. The slope factor (gamma) was proportional to the number of binding sites. The free fraction for a given patient can be evaluated from this relationship. Total clearance of MTX was not statistically different with piroxicam (8.0 l/h for total MTX, 13.7 l/h for free MTX) vs without piroxicam. Likewise, there were no significant difference in tmax, area under the plasma concentration vs time curve, distribution and elimination half-lives, mean resonance time, and volumes of distribution. Although the highest observed total MTX concentration was significantly lower with piroxicam, there were no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between low-dose MTX and piroxicam.

Abstract 341 of 500

To detect differences in clinical short term outcome between total abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. Randomised controlled trial. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hospital of Helsingborg, Sweden. One hundred-twenty women scheduled for hysterectomy for various indications. Randomisation into three treatment arms: total abdominal hysterectomy (n = 40); vaginal hysterectomy (n = 40) and laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (n = 40). During traditional abdominal and vaginal surgery, laparoscopic assistance was kept to a minimum. Substantial number of cases needed volume-reducing manoeuvres due to uterine size. Duration of surgery, anaesthesia, time in hospital and recovery time. Mean duration (range) of surgery was significantly longer for laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy compared with vaginal hysterectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy, 102 min (50-175), 81 min (35-135) and 68 min (28-125), respectively. Mean stay in hospital and mean time to recovery was significantly longer for total abdominal hysterectomy compared with vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. The difference between vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy was not significant. It was possible to remove uteri under 600 g with all three methods. Four laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomies and one vaginal hysterectomy were converted to open surgery. Reoperation and blood transfusion were required after two vaginal hysterectomies and one laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy. One woman needed blood transfusion after total abdominal hysterectomy. Traditional vaginal hysterectomy proved to be feasible and the faster operative technique compared with vaginal hysterectomy with laparoscopic assistance. The abdominal technique was somewhat faster, but time spent in theatre was not significantly shorter. Abdominal hysterectomy required on average a longer hospital stay of one day and one additional week of convalescence compared with traditional vaginal hysterectomy. Vaginal hysterectomy should be a primary method for uterine removal.

Abstract 342 of 500

No prospective randomized trial has specifically examined the long-term outcomes of clopidogrel use in patients with chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to determine the risks and benefits of long-term clopidogrel administration in patients with diabetic nephropathy, the most common form of chronic kidney disease. We performed a post hoc analysis of the CHARISMA trial, which randomly assigned patients without active acute coronary syndrome, but with established atherosclerotic disease (symptomatic) or multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic disease (asymptomatic), to clopidogrel plus aspirin versus placebo plus aspirin. All CHARISMA patients (n = 15,603) were separated into the 3 groups: nondiabetic patients, diabetic patients without nephropathy, and diabetic patients with nephropathy. Within each group, outcomes of patients randomly assigned to clopidogrel were compared with those of patients randomly assigned to placebo. Outcomes in the prespecified CHARISMA subgroups of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients were also compared with respect to study drug assignment and nephropathy status. Patients with nephropathy who received clopidogrel had no difference in bleeding, but experienced significantly increased cardiovascular (CV) and overall mortality compared with those randomly assigned to placebo. There were no differences in bleeding, overall mortality, or CV mortality for nondiabetic or diabetic patients without nephropathy who received clopidogrel versus placebo. In the asymptomatic cohort, patients with nephropathy randomly assigned to clopidogrel had significantly increased overall and CV mortality compared with placebo, whereas asymptomatic patients without nephropathy randomly assigned to clopidogrel had no significant mortality difference compared with placebo. In conclusion, this post hoc analysis suggested that clopidogrel may be harmful in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Additional studies are needed to investigate this possible interaction.

Abstract 343 of 500

Paroxetine (30 mg), a selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, was compared in a double-blind trial to amitriptyline (150 mg) in a sample of 40 inpatients aged 18-65 years who fulfilled Research Diagnostic Criteria for major depression. Patients were studied after a placebo drug washout period of 10 days and after an active 4-week treatment period. Sleep EEG recordings were performed before and at the end of the study as well as during acute treatment (first 2 days) and following withdrawal of active medication. Paroxetine shows an antidepressant effect similar to amitriptyline with a different side-effect profile typical of 5-HT reuptake inhibition. Paroxetine and amitriptyline decreased the amount of REM sleep, a well-known effect of classical antidepressants. Paroxetine also shared with other 5-HT reuptake inhibitors an alerting effect on sleep that was not shown to be detrimental on subjective sleep quality.

Abstract 344 of 500

In a prospective, randomized study we compared cefotaxime (C) with tobramycin plus cefazolin (C + T) in the treatment of Enterobacterial septicemia. Twenty-five patients received C and twenty two C + T. There are 8 treatment failures, in C + T group, 3 in C group. We observed 5 adverse effects, 2 in the C group (1 reversible collapse and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa superinfection) and 3 in the C + T group (acute renal failures). We conclude that C may be more effective and less toxic than cefazolin plus tobramycin for patients with Enterobacterial septicemia.

Abstract 345 of 500

Depression is prevalent in patients with diabetes. It is associated with poor glycemic control and is linked to an increased risk for diabetic complications. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of fluoxetine for depression in patients with diabetes. Sixty patients with diabetes (type 1, n = 26; type 2, n = 34) and major depressive disorder entered an 8-week randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Patients were given daily doses of fluoxetine (up to 40 mg/day). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) were used to measure the severity of depression and to determine the percentage of patients who achieved substantial improvement or complete remission. GHb levels were obtained to monitor glycemic control. Reduction in depression symptoms was significantly greater in patients treated with fluoxetine compared with those receiving placebo (BDI, -14.0 vs. -8.8, P = 0.03; HAMD, -10.7 vs. -5.2, P = 0.01). The percentage of patients achieving a significant improvement in depression per the BDI was also higher in the fluoxetine group (66.7 vs. 37.0%, P = 0.03). Additionally, trends toward a greater rate of depression remission (48.1 vs. 25.9%, P = 0.09 per the HAMD) and greater reduction in GHb (-0.40 vs. -0.07%, P = 0.13) were observed in the fluoxetine group. Fluoxetine effectively reduces the severity of depression in diabetic patients. Our study demonstrated that after only 8 weeks, this treatment also produced a trend toward better glycemic control.

Abstract 346 of 500

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation, which results in the progressive development of dyspnea and exercise limitation. To compare the effect of tiotropium with placebo on forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and lung hyperinflation, using exercise endurance, dyspnea and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as secondary endpoints. One hundred patients were randomized to receive either tiotropium 18 mug once daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Trough (predose) FVC was significantly improved with tiotropium compared to placebo on day 42 (0.27 +/- 0.08 liters) and 84 (0.20 +/- 0.08 liters; p < 0.05 for both). Trough inspiratory capacity (IC) was also significantly improved with tiotropium compared to placebo on day 42 (0.16 +/- 0.07 liters) and 84 (0.15 +/- 0.07 liters; p < 0.05 for both). Tiotropium increased the mean distance walked during the shuttle walking test by 33 +/- 12 (day 42) and 36 +/- 14 m (day 84) compared to placebo (p < 0.05 for both). On day 84, 59% of the patients in the tiotropium group and 35% of the patients in the placebo group had significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score (p < 0.05). Numerical decreases in the focal score in the Transition Dyspnea Index in patients receiving tiotropium versus placebo suggest that tiotropium also improved dyspnea during activities of daily living. Tiotropium 18 mug once daily reduced hyperinflation with consequent improvements in walking distance and HRQoL in patients with COPD and lung hyperinflation.

Abstract 347 of 500

The authors conducted two studies to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of the cyclooxygenase, or COX, -2-specific inhibitor, valdecoxib, with oxycodone/ acetaminophen in patients who have undergone oral surgery. In total, 205 eligible subjects in Study A and 201 in Study B were randomized to receive a single oral dose of valdecoxib (20 or 40 milligrams), a combination of oxycodone 10 mg/acetaminophen 1,000 mg or placebo. Eligible subjects experienced moderate-to-severe pain within six hours of surgery during which two or more impacted third molars were extracted. Analgesic efficacy was assessed over 24 hours or until the patient required rescue analgesia. In both studies, subjects receiving either dose of valdecoxib experienced a rapid onset of analgesia and (among those who received valdecoxib 40 mg) a level of pain relief comparable with that of those who received oxycodone/ acetaminophen. Both valdecoxib doses had a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect than did oxycodone/acetaminophen. Pooled safety data demonstrated that each valdecoxib dose had a tolerability profile superior to that of oxycodone/ acetaminophen and similar to that of placebo. Orally administered valdecoxib is as rapidly acting and effective as oxycodone/acetaminophen, and it has a superior duration of analgesic effect in patients after oral surgery. Valdecoxib has a tolerability profile superior to that of oxycodone/acetaminophen. The current standard of care for alleviating acute pain after oral surgery has rested largely on conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioid/analgesic combination products. The studies reported here suggest that the COX-2-specific inhibitor valdecoxib offers an efficacious and safe alternative to other analgesics used to treat pain after oral surgery.

Abstract 348 of 500

Eradication of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and inhibition of elastolytic matrix metalloproteinases with doxycycline have been suggested to reduce the growth rates of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). We designed a study to investigate the efficacy of doxycycline in reducing the expansion of small AAAs. This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that was set in a university referral hospital. The study group consisted of 32 of 34 initially eligible patients who had an AAA diameter perpendicular to the aortic axis of 30 mm or more in size or a ratio of infrarenal to suprarenal aortic diameter of 1.2 or more and a diameter less than 55 mm. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either doxycycline (150 mg daily) or placebo during a 3-month period and underwent ultrasound surveillance during an 18-month period. Outcome measures included aneurysm expansion rates, the number of patients who had AAA rupture or repair, C pneumoniae antibody titers, and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein. The aneurysm expansion rate in the doxycycline group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group during the 6- to 12-month (P = .01) and the 12- to 18-month periods (P =.01). Five patients (41%) in the placebo group and 1 patient (7%) in the doxycycline group had an overall expansion of the aneurysm of 5 mm or more during the 18-month follow-up. Among the placebo group patients, a higher expansion rate was observed in those with enhanced C pneumoniae immunoglobulin G antibody titers (> 128) than in those with lower titers (P = .03). Doxycycline treatment had no clear effect on antibody titers. However, at 6-month follow-up, C-reactive protein levels in the doxycycline group were significantly lower than the baseline levels (P = .01). The results of this small pilot study suggest that doxycycline may favorably alter the outcome of patients with small AAA. However, because of the small size of this randomized study and of the potentially confounding effect of pretreatment risk factors, doxycycline-based treatment cannot be justified only on the ground of the current results. Because of the high prevalence of this disorder and its clinical, social, and economic relevance, a multicenter study should be performed to further investigate whether there is any place for medical treatment of small AAAs.

Abstract 349 of 500

101 patients with Clostridium-difficile-associated diarrhoea or colitis were prospectively randomised to 10-day oral courses of metronidazole, 250 mg four times a day, or vancomycin, 500 mg four times a day. 7 did not complete the protocol and were dropped from analysis. Pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) was diagnosed after endoscopy in 33 patients. Of the remaining patients without PMC, 38 had both C difficile culture and cytotoxin and 23 had only culture evidence of C difficile. 52 evaluable patients received vancomycin and 42 received metronidazole. There were two treatment failures with metronidazole and none with vancomycin (p = 0.20); and two relapses with metronidazole versus six with vancomycin (p = 0.17). Treatment in 1 patient in each group was discontinued because of drug intolerance. Response and relapse rates of the 33 patients with PMC were no different from those of the remaining patients. Pharmacy cost for the dosage used was $387.48 to $520.00 for vancomycin and $11.84 for metronidazole. Metronidazole and vancomycin have equivalent efficacy and relapse rates and are tolerated to a similar extent by patients with C-difficile-related diarrhoea and colitis, but metronidazole is considerably more economical.

Abstract 350 of 500

Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of cervical application of 20% benzocaine on the pain associated with subsequent cervical injection of local anesthetic and tissue excision during the loop electrosurgical excision procedure of the cervix. Fifty consecutive women scheduled for loop electrosurgical excision were randomized by use of computer-generated numbers to receive cervical application of either 20% benzocaine or placebo gel in a double-blinded fashion. A visual analog scale was used to measure the pain associated with both cervical injection of local anesthetic and tissue excision. Lower mean pain scores were associated with the use of benzocaine gel for both anesthetic injection and tissue excision, but these scores did not reach statistical significance in either group. Preoperative cervical application of 20% benzocaine does not appear to reduce the pain associated with either subsequent local anesthetic injection or tissue excision during the loop electrosurgical excision procedure of the cervix.

Abstract 351 of 500

A prospective randomised double blind crossover trial was conducted comparing the new synthetic cannabinoid nabilone with oral domperidone in a group of children receiving repeated identical courses of emetogenic chemotherapy for a variety of malignant diseases. Eighteen of 23 consecutive eligible children, aged 10 months to 17 years, completed the trial. When taking nabilone they experienced significantly fewer vomiting episodes and less nausea, and two thirds expressed a preference for the drug. The most common side effects of treatment with nabilone were somnolence and dizziness, with one patient being disturbed by hallucinations. The results indicate that nabilone is an effective antiemetic for children having chemotherapy, even for young children. It seems to be superior in this respect to domperidone, and although it has a higher incidence of side effects, these are mostly acceptable to patients. It can be recommended as an alternative to conventional antiemetic treatment throughout childhood.

Abstract 352 of 500

We evaluated the effectiveness of cycloplegics in the treatment of myopia. Patients were selected randomly and divided into three groups: Group 1 received atropine 1% eye drops every other night; Group 2 received cyclopentolate 1% eye drops every night; and Group 3 received normal saline eye drops every night. All the patients were rechecked every three months. The results were evaluated at the end of one year. Ninety-six patients were evaluated, 32 in each group. The mean myopic progression was -0.219 D in the atropine group, -0.578D in the cyclopentolate group, and -0.914D in the saline group. Analysis showed that atropine and cyclopentolate are effective in slowing the progression of myopia. The effect of atropine is better than that of cyclopentolate.

Abstract 353 of 500

To determine the optimal treatment for childhood Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). We performed a randomized, multicenter study of GBS according to international diagnostic criteria. In study 1 (early treatment), children able to walk unaided for 5 meters were randomized for 1 g/kg intravenously administered immunoglobulin (IVIG) over 2 days or no treatment. The primary outcome measure was the degree of disability at nadir. In study 2 (treatment for severe GBS), children unable to walk 5 meters unaided were randomized for 1 g/kg IVIG over 2 days or 0.4 g/kg IVIG over 5 days. The primary outcome measure was the number of days needed to regain the ability to walk unaided. Children randomized for no treatment in study 1 could enter study 2 if loss of unaided walking occurred. Ninety-five children with GBS were registered in 40 months. Twenty-one children were randomized in study 1 and 51 in study 2 (5 after deterioration in study 1). Twenty-eight children were not randomized for various reasons. Eleven of 21 patients in study 1 lost the ability to walk unassisted and 6 were bedridden, with no statistically significant difference between the children initially randomized for treatment versus no treatment. Recovery occurred faster in the group randomized for early treatment. In study 2, recovery did not differ significantly between the children treated for 2 days versus 5 days (median time to unaided walking: 19 days vs 13 days). Secondary transient deterioration in the disability score occurred more frequently in the group with the 2-day regimen than in the group treated for 5 days (5 of 23 patients vs 0 of 23 patients). Multivariate analysis with Cox regression showed that disease severity at the nadir was the only prognostic factor for recovery. Treatment with IVIG before loss of unaided walking did not give rise to a less severe course, but recovery occurred somewhat faster. However, given the small number of patients, the power of this conclusion is low. For treatment after loss of unaided walking, there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of 2 g/kg IVIG administered over 2 days versus 5 days. Early "relapses" occurred more frequently after the shorter treatment regimen.

Abstract 354 of 500

Although osteosclerotic metastases are characteristic of prostatic carcinoma, bone resorption is also accelerated. Since clodronate inhibits bone resorption and relieves bone pain, we have given it to patients with painful bone disease from prostatic cancer after failure of hormonal therapy. All patients received estramustine phosphate orally. Simultaneously they were randomly allocated to clodronate (36) and placebo (39) groups. Clodronate was given by mouth. The dose was 3.2 g for the first month, thereafter 1.6 g. Pain relief was more distinct in the clodronate group where one third of patients were totally free of bone pain. The use of analgesics stopped in 38% of patients on clodronate and in 18% on placebo which effect probably belongs to estramustine phosphate. Serum calcium concentration decreased more markedly in the clodronate group. Clodronate dose of 3.2 g seemed to be more potent than that of 1.6 g. Side effects were uncommon and occurred equally in both groups. No significant differences were seen in median survival or survival rates between the groups.

Abstract 355 of 500

Suppression of spermatogenesis to azoospermia is the goal of hormonal male contraception based on T combined with gestagens. The combination of the long-acting T, ester testosterone undecanoate (TU), with norethisterone (NET) enanthate (E) showed high efficacy. In the present study, we tested the validity of this approach by varying the NET dose and mode of application. The aim of the study was to achieve high rates of suppression of spermatogenesis as reflected by sperm counts, monitor gonadotropins as well as other hormones, and evaluate any possible side effects. In a phase II clinical trial, groups of normal volunteers received: 1000 mg TU im at wk 2, 6, 12, and 18 combined with 200 mg NETE im at wk 0, 6, 12, and 18 (group I); 1000 mg TU im and 400 mg NETE im at wk 0, 6, 12, and 18 (group II); and 1000 mg TU im at wk 0, 6, 12, and 18 with daily oral NET acetate (NETA) from wk 0 to 24 (group III). In all groups marked suppression of gonadotropins resulted in a significant decrease of spermatogenesis and azoospermia in 13/14, 11/12, and 12/14 men in groups I to III, respectively. The remaining men all had less than 1 million sperm/ml. Reversible side effects included increase in body weight, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit and decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase in all groups and increase in liver enzymes in the oral NETA group. This study documents the high efficacy of TU in combination with NET and confirms that this dose and mode of application (1000 mg TU im every 6 wk plus 400 mg NETE im every 6 wk or plus 10 mg daily oral NETA) is as effective as the previously reported regimen containing 1000 mg TU + 200 mg NETE im every 6 wk. The contraceptive efficacy of this combination of TU and NETE should be evaluated in further clinical trials.

Abstract 356 of 500

In spite of an abundant literature on antiandrogen treatment with cyproterone acetate (CA) there have been no objectively measured results to prove statistically the possible superiority of CA over combined oral contraceptive pills in the treatment of acne vulgaris. A multicenter study was therefore done, in which two preparations containing CA in combination with ethinylestradiol (EE) were compared with a marketed combined oral contraceptive pill. The preparations studied were: CA 2 mg + EE 50 micrograms (Diane), CA 2 mg + EE 35 micrograms (Diane mite), Levonorgestrel 150 micrograms + EE 30 micrograms (Neovletta). A woman was eligible for the study if she was found by a dermatologist to have at least eight acne lesions (sum of papules, pustules, cysts and nodules) on her face, was otherwise healthy and without medication. After a primary assessment of the number of acne lesions by the dermatologist the woman was referred to a gynecologist and given one of the three test preparations double-blind and at random. The treatment was to continue for 6 months. 133 women were recruited at eight different centers. The groups thus constituted were of similar size and comparable with regard to age, degree of acne, and menstrual and contraceptive histories. As the number of acne lesions varied considerably between patients all data were converted into percentage change during treatment before they were processed in a computer. After only 4 months of treatment the patients on Diane and Diane mite had a significantly greater reduction in the number of acne lesions compared with those on Neovletta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract 357 of 500

A combination of tobramycin sulfate and cefamandole nafate was used as initial empiric therapy for the treatment of 71 evaluable febrile (temperature greater than 38.5 degrees C) episodes in 64 (neutrophils, less than 1,000/microL) adult patients with cancer and granulocytopenia. Carbenicillin sodium or ticarcillin disodium was substituted for cefamandole in patients with Pseudomonas infections and in patients in whom the initial regimen was unsuccessful. Twenty-nine episodes were randomized to receive tobramycin by continuous infusion, while 42 were randomized to receive tobramycin by interrupted infusion. Twenty-seven (79%) of the 34 documented infections responded to the initial empiric antibiotic combination, ten (83%) of 12 being given continuous infusion and 17 (77%) of 22 being given interrupted infusion of tobramycin. Nephrotoxic reaction occurred in 7% of patients treated with continuous infusion and 15% treated with interrupted infusion, mostly patients older than 60 years. Tobramycin, by either continuous or interrupted infusion, plus cefamandole is safe and efficacious empiric therapy for infections in patients with cancer and granulocytopenia.

Abstract 358 of 500

Transrectal biopsy is one of the more popular methods for the diagnosis of prostatic cancer. However, there is disagreement as to whether the use of prophylactic antimicrobials decreases the incidence of fever and urinary tract infections, which may follow this procedure. A prospective randomized double-blind study involving 63 patients was instituted to determine the efficacy of carbenicillin indanyl sodium in reducing these complications. The protocol consisted of administration of 2 tablets of 4 times daily of a placebo or the treatment drug 24 hours before and after biopsy. Clean catch urine cultures were obtained 24 hours before biopsy and at 48 hours and 2 weeks after the procedure. Blood cultures were performed 15 minutes after biopsy. In addition, clinical parameters were monitored closely in the hospital for 48 hours after biopsy. A total of 48 patients was considered evaluable. Of 23 patients who received the study drug 2 (8.6 per cent) had positive urine cultures at 48 hours compared to 9 of 25 (36 per cent) from the placebo group. A similar result was observed from the 2-week culture data, in which 2 of 23 patients (8.6 per cent) in the treatment group had positive urine cultures as opposed to 5 of 25 (20 per cent) receiving the placebo. Fever occurred in 48 per cent of the placebo and in 17 per cent of the carbenicillin groups. Our data indicate that prophylactic administration of carbenicillin indanyl sodium decreases the complications of fever and urinary tract infections following transrectal biopsy of the prostate.

Abstract 359 of 500

Current chemotherapy treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer has demonstrated some objective responses, but is still largely palliative. This report reviews the results of a randomized trial in patients with advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer which compared treatment with supportive care (treatment with palliative radiation, psychosocial support, analgesics, nutritional support) to supportive care plus combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and vinblastine. Although the patients receiving combination chemotherapy had a slightly longer median survival (20.43 weeks versus 13.57 weeks), it was not statistically significant (P = 0.09). In addition, the patients receiving chemotherapy experienced serious toxicity, and showed no significant benefit in terms of quality of life as measured by Karnofsky performance status score. The authors conclude that contemporary combination chemotherapy provides only modest survival benefit to patients with advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and should not be considered standard therapy. Future investigations of chemotherapy in patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer should continue to utilize control arms which provide high-quality supportive care.

Abstract 360 of 500

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and acetaminophen (paracetamol) are frequently used to treat fever and other symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Both are available over the counter for use at the standard recommended doses of 500 and 1000 mg per single use. This study investigated the efficacy, safety profiles, and tolerability of aspirin 500 and 1000 mg and acetaminophen 500 and 1000 mg compared with placebo in adult patients with acute febrile URTI of suspected viral origin. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in Ukraine and Russia. Patients with URTI and acute fever of > or =38.5 degrees C received a single dose of aspirin 500 or 1000 mg, acetaminophen 500 or 1000 mg, or matching placebo. Oral body temperature was measured in the clinic at specified time points up to 6 hours after dosing. The intensity of other symptoms of URTI was rated by patients at baseline and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing (scale from 0 = none to 10 = severe). The primary efficacy measure was the AUC for the change in orally measured body temperature from the time of treatment (baseline) to 4 hours after dosing. Secondary outcome measures included the change in body temperature from baseline to specified time points between 0.5 and 6 hours after dosing, the difference between baseline and the lowest measured body temperature, the time to the lowest measured body temperature, and the intensity of other symptoms of URTI (ie, headache, sinus sensitivity to percussion, sore throat, achiness, and feverish discomfort). Tolerability was monitored by recording of adverse events. Three hundred ninety-two patients were enrolled (78 in both aspirin groups, 79 in both acetaminophen groups, 78 in the placebo group). Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable in the 5 groups; 51% of patients were male, with a mean age of 37.4 years and a mean body weight of 74.3 kg. The AUC values for the change in body temperature 0 to 4 hours after dosing were 3.18 (95% CI, 2.78-3.57) for aspirin 500 mg, 4.26 (95% CI, 3.84-4.68) for aspirin 1000 mg, 3.13 (95% CI, 2.77-3.49) for acetaminophen 500 mg, 4.11 (95% CI, 3.73-4.49) for acetaminophen 1000 mg, and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.38-1.13) for placebo. In terms of the primary efficacy variable, all active treatments were significantly superior to placebo (P < 0.001, 1-sided t test), with no significant differences between them. Reductions in body temperature were significantly greater with the 1000-mg doses of both active treatments compared with the 500-mg doses (P< 0.001, 1-sided t test). The mean maximum temperature reductions were 1.32 degrees C, 1.25 degrees C, 1.67 degrees C,1.71 degrees C, and 0.63 degrees C in the respective treatment groups. Significant reductions were seen in the mean intensity of headache, achiness, and feverish discomfort with all active treatments at most time points (P < 0.001), but not in sinus sensitivity to percussion or sore throat. All treatments were equally well tolerated, and no clinically significant adverse events occurred. In this single-dose study, aspirin 500 and 1000 mg and acetaminophen 500 and 1000 mg were more effective against fever and other symptoms of URTI than placebo. Both active treatments showed dose-related efficacy, and there was no significant difference between equal doses of the 2 agents. Safety profiles and tolerability were also comparable between treatments.

Abstract 361 of 500

To compare ketanserin with hydralazine in the treatment of hypertension in late pregnancy. Randomised control trial. Ten milligrams ketanserin were compared with 5 mg hydralazine, both given intravenously to 10 patients in each group. Blood pressure, maternal and fetal heart rate and umbilical and arcuate artery Doppler flow velocimetry waveforms were recorded before and every 10 minutes after administration of the drug. No significant differences were found between the two drugs in respect of initial blood pressures and readings taken 10 minutes after each 30-minute administration. One patient in the hydralazine group developed severe hypotension and fetal distress for which a caesarean section was performed. No change in the flow velocity waveforms of umbilical and arcuate arteries was noticed. No unforeseen complications followed the administration of ketanserin. No major differences in the effects of the two drugs could be detected. Ketanserin appears to be safer as no hypotension occurred, and it reduced blood pressure more gradually. As ketanserin could become an alternative to hydralazine, more studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to compare it with hydralazine.

Abstract 362 of 500

This randomized multicenter, open-label, trial compared efficacy, acceptability, tolerability and compliance of NuvaRing with a combined oral contraceptive (COC), containing 30 microg of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 3 mg of drospirenone. In this 13-cycle study, 983 women were randomized and treated (intent-to-treat population) with NuvaRing or COC. One in-treatment pregnancy occurred with NuvaRing (Pearl Index=0.25) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.006, 1.363) and four with the COC (Pearl Index=0.99) (95% CI: 0.269, 2.530). For both groups, compliance (89.2% NuvaRing, 85.5% COC) and satisfaction (84% NuvaRing; 87% COC) were high; the vast majority of women found NuvaRing easy to insert (96%) and remove (97%). Tolerability was similar; the most frequent adverse events with NuvaRing were related to ring use, whereas estrogen-related events were more common with the COC. NuvaRing has comparable efficacy and tolerability to a COC containing 30 microg of EE and 3 mg drospirenone. User acceptability of both methods was high.

Abstract 363 of 500

To compare combination use of repaglinide, metformin and bedtime Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin with conventional approaches of insulin initiation in patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Eighty-two patients with T2DM with suboptimal glycaemic control on oral glucose-lowering agents were randomized to one of three treatment regimens for 4 months. Group 1 received metformin and twice daily biphasic 30/70 human insulin mixture (n = 27), group 2 metformin and bedtime NPH insulin (n = 26) and group 3 metformin, bedtime NPH insulin and mealtime repaglinide (n = 25). Seventy-five patients completed the study. Baseline and end-point mean HbA1c levels fell from 9.0 +/- 1.1 to 7.9 +/- 1.1% in group 1, 10.0 +/- 2.2 to 9.2 +/- 1.4% group 2 and 10.0 +/- 1.7 to 8.1 +/- 1.5% in group 3, respectively. All groups showed improvements in HbA1c. There was no significant difference between groups in the proportions of patients experiencing hypoglycaemia (29.6, 25.0 and 16.7%, respectively; P = 0.55) or in mean weight gain (2.9, 0.7 and 2.2 kg, respectively; P = 0.06). By 4 months, insulin doses were 0.63 +/- 0.32 IU/kg in group 1, 0.58 +/- 0.21 IU/kg in group 2 and 0.37 +/- 0.22 IU/kg in group 3 (group 3 vs. groups 1 and 2: P < 0.002). The approach using repaglinide, metformin and NPH insulin improved glycaemic control with a similar safety profile to conventional insulin initiation in T2DM and produced final glycaemic control similar to metformin and a twice daily biphasic insulin mixture.

Abstract 364 of 500

A randomized trial of cyclosporine in patients with steroid-resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. A clinical trial of cyclosporine in patients with steroid-resistant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was conducted. Despite the fact that it is the most common primary glomerulonephritis to progress to renal failure, treatment trials have been very limited. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 49 cases of steroid-resistant FSGS comparing 26 weeks of cyclosporine treatment plus low-dose prednisone to placebo plus prednisone. All patients were followed for an average of 200 weeks, and the short- and long-term effects on renal function were assessed. Seventy percent of the treatment group versus 4% of the placebo group (P < 0. 001) had a partial or complete remission of their proteinuria by 26 weeks. Relapse occurred in 40% of the remitters by 52 weeks and 60% by week 78, but the remainder stayed in remission to the end of the observation period. Renal function was better preserved in the cyclosporine group. There was a decrease of 50% in baseline creatinine clearance in 25% of the treated group compared with 52% of controls (P < 0.05). This was a reduction in risk of 70% (95% CI, 9 to 93) independent of other baseline demographic and laboratory variables. These results suggest that cyclosporine is an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of steroid-resistant cases of FSGS. Although a high relapse rate does occur, a long-term decrease in proteinuria and preservation of filtration function were observed in a significant proportion of treated patients.

Abstract 365 of 500

This study was undertaken to compare oral to injected methotrexate with respect to effectiveness, side effects, and acceptability. One hundred women in an urban primary care practice were randomly assigned in phase 1 to receive 50 mg/m(2) methotrexate by either the oral or the injected route. In phase 2 another 87 women were allowed to choose between the oral and injected routes. In both phases and in all groups the methotrexate was followed 5 to 7 days later by misoprostol administered vaginally by the patient. The main outcome was the success rate (the number whose pregnancies aborted without surgery); other outcomes included side effects and acceptability. There were no differences in rates of success, side effects, or acceptability between groups receiving oral and injected methotrexate. Among the women in phase 2 the oral form was chosen by 57.5%. This study indicates that for medical abortions induced with methotrexate and misoprostol it is possible to offer both the oral and injected routes of methotrexate without sacrificing efficacy and that about half of the women offered a choice will choose the oral route.

Abstract 366 of 500

Treatment of posttransplant hypertension is still a matter of debate. Calcium antagonists may ameliorate renal side effects of cyclosporin. Angiotensin converting enzyme- (ACE) inhibitors may be more effective in sustaining renal function in native chronic renal disease. We prospectively compared the effect of controlled release nifedipine and lisinopril on long-term renal function in hypertensive kidney transplant patients treated with cyclosporin. A total of 154 renal transplant patients presenting with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure >or=95 mmHg) during the first 3 weeks after transplantation were randomised to receive double-blind nifedipine 30 mg or lisinopril 10 mg once daily. A total of 123 patients completed 1 year of treatment (69 nifedipine, 54 lisinopril) and 64 patients completed 2 years of double-blind treatment (39 nifedipine, 25 lisinopril). Baseline glomerular filtration rate was measured as 99 mTc-diethylene-triaminepentaacetate clearance in a stable phase 2 to 5 weeks after inclusion and repeated at 1 and 2 years. Baseline glomerular filtration rates were similar (46+/-16 ml/min with nifedipine, 43+/-14 ml/min with lisinopril). The changes in glomerular filtration rates from baseline were statistically significant between the groups after 1 year (9.6 ml/min mean treatment difference (95% confidence interval [CI]s 5.5-13.7 ml/min, P=0.0001) and remained statistically significant also after 2 years (10.3 ml/min mean difference (95% CIs 4.0-16.6], P=0.0017). After 1 year glomerular filtration rates averaged 56+/-19 ml/min in the nifedipine group and 44+/-14 ml/min in the lisinopril group. Both nifedipine and lisinopril were safe and effective in treatment of hypertension in renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporin. Patients receiving nifedipine but not lisinopril improved kidney transplant function over a period of 2 years.

Abstract 367 of 500

Clonidine and neostigmine have a central mechanism of analgesic action and are synergistic when given intrathecally. Both drugs also have a peripheral analgesic effect. The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic effect of intraarticular clonidine and neostigmine, used separately and in combination, in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy. Eighty-four American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I and II patients scheduled for meniscus repair under arthroscopy were allocated randomly in 6 groups to receive in a double-blind manner at the end of surgery 150 microg of intraarticular clonidine with subcutaneous saline, 500 microg of intraarticular neostigmine with subcutaneous saline, an intraarticular combination of 150 microg of clonidine and 500 microg of neostigmine with subcutaneous saline, 150 microg of intraarticular clonidine with 500 microg of subcutaneous neostigmine, 500 microg of intraarticular neostigmine with 150 microg of subcutaneous clonidine, or intraarticular and subcutaneous isotonic saline. Postoperative pain scores were measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and on mobilization. Paracetamol (1 g) was given as a rescue medication when pain score was greater than 40. VAS scores at rest and on mobilization were lower in the first 5 groups compared with the intraarticular saline group (P <.05), but no significant difference was documented between the treated groups. The time to the first paracetamol administration was shorter in the saline group compared with the other groups, and the paracetamol demand was also higher in this group. Forty-five percent of the patients who had received clonidine had at least 1 episode of hypotension versus 4% of those who did not (P <.01). The incidence of bradycardia was 20% and 0%, respectively (P =.01). The incidence of nausea was not statistically different in patients who did and did not receive neostigmine (43% v. 36%, respectively). Intraarticular administration of 150 microg of clonidine, 500 microg of neostigmine, or both produce postoperative analgesia, and the combination is not more effective.

Abstract 368 of 500

High thoracic epidural anesthesia/analgesia (HTEA) for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery may have myocardial protective effects. In this prospective randomized controlled study, we investigated the effect of HTEA for elective CABG surgery on the release of troponin I, time to tracheal extubation, and analgesia. One-hundred-twenty patients were randomized to a general anesthesia (GA) group or a GA plus HTEA group. The GA group received fentanyl (7-15 microg/kg) and a morphine infusion. The HTEA group received fentanyl (5-7 microg/kg) and an epidural infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% and fentanyl 2 microg/mL until postoperative Day 3. There were no differences in troponin I levels between study groups. The time to tracheal extubation [median (interquartile range)] in the HTEA group was 15 min (10-320 min), compared with 430 min (284-590 min) in the GA group (P < 0.0001). Analgesia was improved in the HTEA group compared with the GA group. Mean arterial blood pressure poststernotomy and systemic vascular resistance in the intensive care unit were lower in the HTEA group. We conclude that HTEA for CABG surgery had no effect on troponin release but improved postoperative analgesia and was associated with a reduced time to extubation.

Abstract 369 of 500

In a prospective randomised trial, 620 patients who had Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis with central nervous system involvement were treated either with prednisolone plus melarsoprol or with melarsoprol only. 598 patients were evaluable: morbidity and death associated with melarsoprol-induced encephalopathy was reduced in patients who were given prednisolone. The two groups did not differ either in the incidence of other complications of melarsoprol therapy or in relapse rate after melarsoprol therapy. The cost of prednisolone would be outweighed by savings on the treatment of encephalopathies in such patients.

Abstract 370 of 500

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a commonly observed adverse effect of anaesthesia. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of granisetron administered orally for preventing PONV in female patients undergoing major gynaecological surgery. In a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 120 patients received orally either placebo or granisetron (1 mg, 2 mg or 4 mg) (n = 30 for each) 1 h before surgery. The same standard general plus regional anaesthetic technique was employed throughout. Postoperatively, during the first 24 h after anaesthesia, the incidence of PONV and adverse events was recorded by nursing staff. The incidence of PONV was 47% with placebo, 37% with granisetron 1 mg, 10% with granisetron 2 mg and 10% with granisetron 4 mg (P < 0.05; overall Fisher's exact probability test). No difference in the incidence of adverse events was observed among the groups. Preoperative oral granisetron in a minimum dose of 2 mg is effective for preventing PONV after major gynaecological surgery.

Abstract 371 of 500

To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) to correct decreased hemoglobin levels in patients undergoing radiotherapy and to get an estimate of its influence on the efficacy of radiotherapy. Fifty patients with cancer of the head and neck and the pelvis were randomized before radiotherapy to different rhEPO treatments (none, 3 x 150 U/kg per week i.v., 3 x 300 U/kg per week i.v. and 3 x 150 U/kg per week s.c.). Hematological parameters were evaluated weekly and the locoregional tumor control rates were determined in 38 patients with head and neck cancer. rhEPO-treated patients showed a significant increase in their hemoglobin values (0.7 g/100 ml per week). The rhEPO response was comparable for patients with cancer of the head and neck and the pelvis. A delayed recovery was seen when iron deficiency or impaired iron mobilization was present. No serious toxicity was observed. Locoregional tumor control was improved, although not statistically significantly, in those head and neck cancer patients who experienced a rapid rise of hemoglobin. Low hemoglobin levels can be safely and quickly corrected with rhEPO. This may improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy.

Abstract 372 of 500

The inappropriate endogenous secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) could play a role in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), one of the most frequent causes of death in cancer patients. Because of its capacity to inhibit TNF secretion in vitro, pentoxifylline (PTX) could be extremely useful in ARDS therapy. In this study 30 advanced cancer patients with ARDS were randomized to receive either the conventional care or conventional care plus PTX (100 mg i.v. twice a day for 7 days followed by an oral administration of 400 mg three times a day) to evaluate the efficacy of PTX in reducing TNF serum levels and in improving the symptoms of this syndrome. Serum levels of TNF were measured before and after 7 days of therapy. The percentage of patients alive at 7 days was significantly higher in the PTX-treated group than in the controls (12/15 versus 3/15; P < 0.001). The mean survival time was significantly higher in the PTX-treated group than in the controls. A clinical and/or radiological improvement was obtained in 11/15 patients treated with PTX and in only 2/15 patients in the conventional care group (P < 0.01). TNF mean levels significantly decrease in the PTX-treated group. These data confirm in vivo the capacity of PTX to inhibit TNF secretion in patients with ARDS. Moreover PTX therapy may improve the symptoms related to ARDS without particular toxic effects.

Abstract 373 of 500

Protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II) has been used for the evaluation of vitamin K deficiency in the newborn. Differing PIVKA-II detection rates in various studies on hemorrhagic disease of the newborn have not been explained satisfactorily. In this study we investigated the PIVKA-II values of 44 healthy breastfed infants, of whom 29 received vitamin K1 either orally (N = 13) or intramuscularly (n = 16), and the remaining 15 constituted the control group. PIVKA-II was detected in 15.3 percent (2/13) of the oral and 25 percent of the (4/16) intramuscular group on the third day of life. The detection rate was 93.3 percent (14/15) in the control group. However, at the one-month follow-up, there were no PIVKA-II positive infants. In conclusion, PIVKA-II positivity among breastfed Turkish infants on the third day of life was high compared to that in other studies, perhaps due to a delay in enzyme maturation related to racial, environmental and nutritional factors.

Abstract 374 of 500

Eighty-six elderly people with limited mobility and dependence in at least one activity of daily living were recruited to a home exercise study. The subjects (mean age 82 years) were allocated at random to either a strength exercise group, a mobility exercise group or a health education group. Subjects were visited for 30 minutes every 3-4 weeks by a physiotherapist who gave both verbal and written instruction. Sixty-nine of the original 86 completed the 6-month study, with five drop-outs from the strength group, ten drop-outs from the mobility group, and two drop-outs from the health education group. By the end of the study, there were no significant differences between the groups with regard to changes in outcome variables. The results showed a trend towards improvement in both the exercise groups in both Sit to Stand and Timed Get Up and Go tests, but this failed to attain statistical significance. Further work is required to identify the optimal exercise intervention for this subgroup of the elderly population.

Abstract 375 of 500

A recent meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials indicated that daily compared with intermittent iron supplementation resulted in significantly greater hematological improvement in pregnant women. No such definitive beneficial effect was demonstrated in preschool children. We compared the efficacy of daily and twice weekly iron supplementation for 6 wk under supervised and unsupervised conditions in the treatment of mild and moderate anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) 50-109 g/L] in children aged 2-59 mo living in a malaria-endemic area of western Kenya. The study was a cluster-randomized trial using a factorial design; participants were aware of the treatment assigned. All children (n = 1049) were administered a single dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine at enrollment followed by 6 wk of daily supervised iron supplementation [3-6 mg/(kg.d)], twice weekly supervised iron supplementation [6-12 mg/(kg.wk)], daily unsupervised iron supplementation, or twice weekly unsupervised iron supplementation. In the supervised groups, Hb concentrations at 6 and 12 wk (6 wk postsupplementation) were significantly higher in children given iron daily rather than twice weekly [mean (95% CI) difference at 6-wk: 4.2 g/L (2.1, 6.4); 12-wk: 4.4 g/L (1.8, 7.0)]. Among the unsupervised groups, Hb concentrations were not different at 6 wk [mean (95% CI) difference: 0.86 g/L (-1.4, 3.1)], but significantly higher at 12 wk for those assigned daily iron [mean (95% CI) difference: 3.4 g/L (0.79, 6.0), P = 0.02]. In this malarious area and after initial antimalarial treatment, 6 wk of daily iron supplementation results in better hematological responses than twice weekly iron supplementation in the treatment of anemia in preschool children, regardless of whether adherence can be ensured.

Abstract 376 of 500

A prospective double blind placebo controlled study was carried out to compare the effects of subacromial injection of triamcinolone and oral diclofenac in patients with rotator cuff tendinitis over a 4-week period. Both forms of treatment were superior to placebo in reducing pain, improving active abduction and reducing functional limitation. Triamcinolone showed the greatest effect in these respects, and was significantly superior to diclofenac when patients showing improvements in all 3 variables together (responders) were considered.

Abstract 377 of 500

To compare follicular fluid (FF) anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B concentrations for GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) and GnRH antagonist cycles and to determine the correlations between FF AMH or inhibin B concentrations and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) outcomes. Prospective comparative study. University hospital. Eighty-seven women who underwent COH cycles, either in the GnRH-a long-protocol group (n = 43) or the GnRH antagonist multiple-dose flexible-protocol group (n = 44). Follicular fluid was obtained from dominant follicles during oocyte retrieval, and FF AMH, inhibin B, E(2), and P concentrations were measured. Serum levels of AMH and inhibin B also were assessed on the day of oocyte retrieval. Follicular fluid AMH and inhibin B concentrations. Concentrations of serum AMH and inhibin B and of FF AMH, inhibin B, E(2), and P were similar in the two groups. Follicular fluid AMH levels were found to be significantly correlated with age, gonadotropin dose, number of follicles on hCG day, and number of oocytes retrieved. Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in follicular microenvironment in terms of AMH and inhibin B secretion between GnRH-a and GnRH antagonist protocols and that FF AMH is a marker that reflects ovarian reserve and response to COH.

To compare the effects of a new 21-day combined oral contraceptive containing 30 microg ethinyl/estradiol plus 3 mg drospirenone with a 21-day preparation containing 30 microg ethinyl/estradiol plus 75 microg gestodene on bone turnover and bone mineral density in young fertile women. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted with healthy fertile women treated with 30 microg ethinyl/estradiol plus 3 mg drospirenone (group A; n = 24), 30 microg ethinyl/estradiol plus 75 microg gestodene (group B; n = 24) and healthy controls (group C, n = 23). At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of the study, serum and urinary calcium, osteocalcin, urinary pyridinoline, and deoxypyridinoline were measured. At baseline and after 12 months, lumbar bone mineral density was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. In groups A and B, urinary pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline at 6, 9, and 12 months were significantly reduced in comparison with basal values and group C (P < .05). Pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline levels were lower in group A than in group B throughout the study, but not significantly. In group A serum calcium levels were significantly increased after 6 months. At 12 months, no significant difference was detected in lumbar bone mineral density values among the 3 groups and in comparison with basal values. Both combined oral contraceptives exert a similar positive influence on bone turnover and bone-sparing effect in young postadolescent women.

Abstract 379 of 500

Compared with other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, the elimination of temocapril is less dependent on renal function. To investigate the metabolic and antihypertensive effects of temocapril in diabetic hypertensives, 30 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and mild to moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (BP) 90-115 mm Hg] and without azotemia (plasma creatinine < 180 microM) were evaluated in a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. After a 4-week placebo run-in, they received temocapril, 20 mg daily (n = 19), or placebo (n = 11) for 6 weeks. Insulin sensitivity index (SI), determined by the Minimal Model method of Bergman, serum lipoproteins, plasma renin activity, fibrinogen, and microalbuminuria were assessed at the end of the placebo run-in phase and the double-blind treatment phases. Temocapril but not placebo administration produced a significant decrease in supine BP (152/92+/-5/3 vs. 162/98+/-5/2 mm Hg; p < 0.01) and increase in plasma renin (p < 0.05). Variation of SI during temocapril treatment did not reach statistical significance (0.95+/-0.2 before vs. 1.44+/-0.4 x 10(-4)/min/mU/L after treatment). During administration of temocapril or placebo, no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and serum levels of total triglycerides, cholesterol, lipoprotein cholesterol fractions, or fibrinogen were observed. Microalbuminuria decreased significantly on temocapril treatment (49+/-10 vs. 79+/-17 mg/24 h; p < 0.01) but not on placebo. These findings demonstrate that in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, short-term treatment with temocapril is neutral to insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein metabolism, and fibrinogen, and significantly reduces microalbuminuria.

Abstract 380 of 500

The relationship between steady-state plasma concentration and clinical response was studied in 22 hospitalized unipolar depressed patients. In a double-blind format the patients were randomly assigned to receive amitriptyline or nortriptyline. Dosage was adjusted based on plasma level with the aim of achieving a concentration of 60-180 ng/ml. By week 4 of treatment, 83% of amitriptyline patients and all nortriptyline patients were within the targeted plasma range. Based on final ratings of clinical state, the drug level adjustment improved the outcome for nortriptyline-treated patients, but not amitriptyline-treated patients. Nortriptyline patients with plasma levels of 60-230 ng/ml had lower Hamilton Rating Scale depression scores than patients outside that range. By contrast, amitriptyline plasma levels were not associated with depression ratings. After 1 week, patients treated with nortriptyline had a significantly greater mean reduction in Hamilton depression score, i.e., 55% compared to 25% for amitriptyline patients.

Abstract 381 of 500

Little research has been carried out on the benefits of intensive case management (ICM) for people with borderline IQ and severe mental illness. To compare outcome and costs of care of patients with severe psychotic illness with borderline IQ to patients of normal IQ and to assess whether ICM is more beneficial for the former than for the latter. The study utilises data from the UK700 multi-centre randomised controlled trial of case management. The main outcome measure was the number of days spent in hospital for psychiatric reasons. Secondary outcomes were costs of care and clinical outcome. ICM was significantly more beneficial for borderline-IQ patients than those of normal IQ in terms of reductions in days spent in hospital, hospital admissions, total costs and needs and increased satisfaction. ICM appears to be a cost-effective strategy for a subgroup of patients with severe psychosis with cognitive deficits.

Abstract 382 of 500

Duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, was evaluated for therapeutic efficacy and safety/tolerability in the treatment of major depression. In an 8-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 173 patients (aged 18-65 years) with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly allocated to receive placebo (N = 70), duloxetine (N = 70), or fluoxetine, 20 mg q.d. (N = 33). Duloxetine dose was titrated in the first 3 weeks in a forced-titration regimen from 40 mg (20 mg b.i.d.) to 120 mg/day (60 mg b.i.d.). Patients were required to have a Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-Severity of Illness scale score of at least moderate severity (> or = 4) and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score of at least 15. Patients could not have had any current primary DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis other than major depressive disorder, or any anxiety disorder as a primary diagnosis within the past year, excluding specific phobias. The primary efficacy measurement was the HAM-D-17 total score, and secondary measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, CGI-Severity of Illness and CGI-Improvement, and Patient Global Impression of Improvement. Safety was evaluated by recording the occurrence of discontinuation rates and treatment-emergent adverse events and by measurement of vital signs and laboratory analytes. Duloxetine was superior to placebo in change on the HAM-D-17 (p = .009). Estimated probabilities of response and remission were 64% and 56%, respectively, for duloxetine, compared with 52% and 30% for fluoxetine and 48% and 32% for placebo. Duloxetine was numerically superior to fluoxetine on the primary and most of the secondary outcome measures. In general, duloxetine was well tolerated; 76% of patients achieved the maximum dose, and insomnia and asthenia were the only adverse events reported statistically significantly (p < .05) more frequently by duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. These data indicate that duloxetine is efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated and safe.

Abstract 383 of 500

To determine whether the use of a prostaglandin (PG) E2 3-mg pessary followed by a delay of 12 hours before stimulation of labor with oxytocin improves obstetric outcome compared with the use of a placebo pessary. One hundred fifty-five nulliparas at term with poor cervical scores (modified Bishop score below 6 of 10) and premature rupture of membranes (PROM) were recruited for this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. On admission to the study, either a PGE2 pessary or an identical-appearing placebo pessary was inserted into the posterior fornix. If labor did not start in the next 12 hours or if symptoms and signs of infection were evident, labor was induced with oxytocin infusion. Assignment was unblinded at the end of the study, and details of the labor and maternal and neonatal outcome in women who received a PG pessary were compared with those who received a placebo pessary. Women receiving a PG pessary were significantly less likely to require stimulation of labor at the end of 12 hours than were those given a placebo pessary (37 versus 58%, P = .002). The mean time between admission to study and delivery was significantly shorter in the PG group compared with the placebo group (15 versus 19 hours, P = .01). The rate of cesarean delivery was not statistically different in the two groups (13.9% with PG versus 15.8% with placebo). In nulliparas with poor cervical scores who present with PROM at term and no evidence of infection or obstetric complications, use of a PGE2 pessary resulted in more women establishing labor earlier, with a resultant reduction in the admission-to-delivery interval, compared with the use of a placebo pessary. The cesarean delivery rates in the two groups were similar, and there were no significant differences in neonatal outcome.

Abstract 384 of 500

To estimate and compare the effectiveness and safety of 5 spermicides over 6 and 7 months of use, respectively. The spermicides included 3 gels containing 52.5 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg of nonoxynol-9 per dose and a film and a suppository, each containing 100 mg of nonoxynol-9 per dose. Women wishing to use only spermicide for contraception for 7 months were randomly assigned to use 1 of the 5 spermicides with emergency contraception backup. Participants were followed up for up to 30 weeks after admission. Of 1,536 women enrolled, 868 (57%) either relied on the spermicide for 6 months or became pregnant. The probability of pregnancy during 6 months of typical use of the spermicide was 22% (95% confidence limits 16%, 28%) in the 52.5-mg gel group, 16% (10%, 21%) in the 100-mg gel group, 14% (9%, 19%) in the 150-mg gel group, 12% (7%, 17%) in the film group, and 10% (6%, 15%) in the suppository group. The pregnancy risk in the 52.5-mg gel group was significantly different (P <.05) from that in either of the other gel groups. The pregnancy risks in the three 100-mg product groups were not significantly different (P =.35). No significant differences among groups were found in the 7-month probability of specified urogenital conditions. The gel with the lowest amount of nonoxynol-9 was less effective than the 2 higher-dose gels. Among 3 products containing 100 mg of nonoxynol-9, formulation did not significantly affect pregnancy risk. All products were safe. I

Abstract 385 of 500

N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists were shown to be effective in suppressing the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Intravenous anesthetic, ketamine, is the most potent N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist available in clinical practice. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of subanesthetic ketamine infusion, as little human data are available on ketamine in precipitated opiate withdrawal. A total of 58 opiate-dependent patients were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients underwent rapid opiate antagonist induction under general anesthesia. Prior to opiate antagonist induction patients were given either placebo (normal saline) or subanesthetic ketamine infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/h. Further evaluations were divided into three phases: anesthetic, early postanesthetic (48 hours), and remote at 4 months after procedure. Cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and gastrointestinal responses to opiate antagonist induction were monitored during anesthesia phase. Changes in plasma cortisol concentrations were measured as stress-response markers. Evaluations during early postanesthetic phase were based on Subjective and Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scales. Remote effects were assessed according to questionnaire based on Addiction Severity Index. Altogether, 50 patients were included in the final analysis. Ketamine group presented better control of withdrawal symptoms, which lasted beyond ketamine infusion itself. Significant differences between Ketamine and Control groups were noted in anesthetic and early postanesthetic phases. There were no differences in effects on outcome after 4 months. In this study, subanesthetic ketamine infusion was an effective adjuvant in the correction of acute precipitated opiate withdrawal although it had no long-term effects on treatment of opiate dependence.

Abstract 386 of 500

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of salt-restriction alone and in combination with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (cilazapril) on both office and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) levels in free living subjects with elevated BP. The study was carried out in an out-patient setting with subjects recruited from occupational health care system mainly. After exclusions, 39 subjects (24 men, 15 women, aged 28-65 years) with mildly to moderately elevated BP completed the study. After 3 months run-in period with placebo (first month on normal-salt and the next 2 months on sodium-restricted diet) the subjects were randomised into either salt-restriction placebo or salt-restriction cilazapril (2.5 mg daily) groups for 3 months. In the whole group, 24-h urinary sodium excretion decreased (mean +/- s.d.) from 198 +/- 60 to 112 +/- 59 mmol (4 weeks vs 24 weeks, P < 0.001). Systolic and diastolic office BP decreased during the placebo-sodium-restriction phase (-7.1 [95% Cl -11.2; -3.0] and -4.2 [95% Cl -6.6; -1.8] mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP), and similarly the daytime ambulatory BP (ABP) was reduced during this period (-2.8 [95% Cl -5.2; -0.5] and -2.8 [95% Cl -4.5; -1.2] mm Hg, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) respectively). No changes were observed in the night time ABP. Addition of cilazapril to sodium-restriction enhanced significantly the office BP (-13.2, [95% Cl -20.2; -6.2], and -9.1 [95% Cl -13.5; -4.7]) and daytime ABP (-5.9, [95% Cl -10.1; -1.8] and -5.3, [95% Cl -8.8; -1.9]) reduction. Blood glucose, plasma insulin or serum lipids did not change during the study. Moderate sodium restriction seems to lower the office and daytime ABP levels in subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension. The antihypertensive effect of cilazapril could be enhanced by sodium restriction.

Abstract 387 of 500

Twenty-three rheumatic disease patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteopenia (defined by measurement of forearm bone mass) completed an 18-month double-blind, randomized study to assess the effect of oral calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-OH2D) or calcium and placebo on bone and mineral metabolism. Intestinal 47Ca absorption was increased (P less than 0.05) and serum parathyroid hormone levels were suppressed (P less than 0.01) by 1,25-OH2D (mean dose 0.4 micrograms/day); however, no significant gain in forearm bone mass occurred, and bone fractures were frequent in both groups. In the 1,25-OH2D group, histomorphometric analysis of iliac crest biopsy specimens demonstrated a decrease in osteoclasts/mm2 of trabecular bone (P less than 0.05) and parameters of osteoblastic activity (P less than 0.05), indicating that 1,25-OH2D reduced both bone resorption and formation. We conclude that 1,25-OH2D should not be used for treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteopenia. Since patients receiving calcium and placebo did not exhibit a loss of forearm bone mass, elemental calcium supplementation of 500 mg daily might be useful to maintain skeletal mass in patients receiving long-term glucocorticord therapy.

Abstract 388 of 500

One hundred ninety-two patients with previously untreated metastatic cancer (102 non-small-cell lung cancer [NSCLC]; 90 colorectal cancer) were randomized to receive either ad lib nutritional intake (control group) or specific nutritional intervention during a 12-week study period when chemotherapy was administered. Those patients randomized to nutritional interventions were counselled to take oral nutrients with caloric intake equal to 1.7 to 1.95 times their basal energy expenditure, depending on their pretreatment nutritional status ("standard" group). An augmented group was counselled to have a caloric intake equivalent to that of the standard group but with 25% of calories provided as protein and additional supplements of zinc and magnesium. Counselling increased caloric intake in both tumor types but reduced weight loss in the short term only for lung cancer patients. Ninety-three NSCLC patients were evaluable for tumor response to vindesine and cisplatin. Overall, only 20.4% of the patients responded, and there were no significant differences in response rates, median time to progression, or overall duration of survival between the nutrition intervention groups and the control group. The tumor response rate to time-sequenced 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and methotrexate in the 81 evaluable patients with colorectal cancer was only 14.8%, and no significant differences in tumor response rates were noted between the three groups. Furthermore, the median time to progression and overall duration of survival were not different for the control, standard, and augmented groups. Nutritional interventions using dietary counselling had no impact on the percent of planned chemotherapy dose administered, the degree of toxicity experienced by patients, or the frequency of treatment delays. A multivariate prognostic factor analysis demonstrated that for lung cancer, the percent of weight loss, serum albumin concentration, and presence of liver metastases were significant (P less than .05) and independent prognostic variables for survival duration. For colorectal cancer, serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and percent targeted caloric intake (TCI) were significant independent predictors of survival duration.

Abstract 390 of 500

Although corticosteroids are highly effective in improving symptoms of Crohn's disease, they may have substantial toxicity. In some patients, attempts to discontinue corticosteroids are unsuccessful. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of weekly injections of methotrexate in patients who had chronically active Crohn's disease despite a minimum of three months of prednisone therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg once weekly) or placebo for 16 weeks. The patients also received prednisone (20 mg once a day), which was tapered over 10 weeks unless their condition worsened. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission at the end of the 16-week trial. Remission was defined by the discontinuation of prednisone and a score of < or = 150 points on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index. A total of 141 patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to methotrexate (94 patients) or placebo (47 patients). After 16 weeks, 37 patients (39.4 percent) were in clinical remission in the methotrexate group, as compared with 9 patients (19.1 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.025; relative risk, 1.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 3.48). The patients in the methotrexate group received less prednisone overall than those in the placebo group (P = 0.026). The mean (+/- SE) score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index after 16 weeks of treatment was significantly lower in the methotrexate group (162 +/- 12) than in the placebo group (204 +/- 17, P = 0.002). The changes in quality-of-life scores and serum orosomucoid concentrations were similar. In the methotrexate group, 16 patients (17 percent) withdrew from treatment because of adverse events (including asymptomatic elevation of serum aminotransferase in 7 and nausea in 6), as compared with 1 patient (2 percent) in the placebo group. In a group of patients with chronically active Crohn's disease, methotrexate was more effective than placebo in improving symptoms and reducing requirements for prednisone.

Abstract 391 of 500

Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials previously showed that fluconazole (400 mg/d) administered prophylactically decreases the incidence of candidiasis in blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. However, there exists conflicting data regarding the optimal duration of fluconazole administration, specifically whether prophylaxis through acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) results in improved survival in allograft recipients. Reported here are the results of long-term follow-up and a detailed analysis of invasive candidiasis and candidiasis-related death in 300 patients who received fluconazole (400 mg/d) or placebo for 75 days after BMT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Patients in both treatment arms were compared for survival, causes of death, and the incidence of invasive fungal infections early (less than 110 days) and late (more than 110 days) after BMT. After 8 years of follow-up, survival is significantly better in fluconazole recipients compared with placebo recipients (68 of 152 vs 41 of 148, P =.0001). The overall incidence of invasive candidiasis was increased in patients who received placebo compared with fluconazole (30 of 148 vs 4 of 152, P <.001). More patients who received placebo died with candidiasis early (13 of 148 vs 1 of 152, P =.001) and late (8 of 96 vs 1 of 121, P =.0068) after BMT. The incidence of severe GVHD involving the gut was higher in patients who did not receive fluconazole (20 of 143 vs 8 of 145, P =.02), and fewer patients who received fluconazole died with this complication. Thus, administration of fluconazole (400 mg/d) for 75 days after BMT appears to be associated with decreased gut GVHD, a persistent protection against disseminated candidal infections and candidiasis-related death, resulting in an overall survival benefit in allogeneic BMT recipients.

Abstract 392 of 500

Misoprostol, an inexpensive, stable, orally active prostaglandin analogue, has been suggested for use in the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage. Potential side-effects, however, need to be quantified. To compare the rate of postpartum shivering and pyrexia following oral misoprostol 600 micrograms and placebo. A double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Women in labour were randomly allocated to receive either misoprostol 600 micrograms orally or placebo after delivery. Conventional oxytocics were given immediately if blood loss was thought to be more than usual. Side-effects were recorded. Postpartum blood loss in the first hour was measured by collection in a special flat plastic bedpan. The labour ward of an academic hospital in Johannesburg, with 7,000 deliveries per annum. Shivering and pyrexia. The groups were well matched. Misoprostol use was associated with more shivering (44% versus 11%, relative risk (RR) 4.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.85-5.70), pyrexia > or = 37.8 degrees C (38% v. 6%, RR 6.23, CI 3.89-9.97), 1-hour systolic blood pressure > or = 140 mmHg (33% v. 25%, RR 1.32, CI 1.03-1.70), and diastolic blood pressure > or = 90 mmHg (10.5% v. 3.0%, RR 3.44, CI 1.67-7.11). There were no other significant differences. The study was not designed to be large enough to assess a difference in blood loss > or = 1,000 ml (9% v. 9.7%, RR 0.93, CI 0.56-1.53). Possible effects on blood loss may have been obscured by the lesser use of additional oxytocics in the misoprostol group (14% v. 18%, RR 0.78, CI 0.54-1.13). This study has shown the association of postpartum oral misoprostol 600 micrograms with shivering, pyrexia and hypertension. The increased blood pressure, as for the trend towards increased abdominal pain, may be secondary to the uterotonic effect of misoprostol. Large randomised trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of misoprostol in the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage, against which the disadvantages demonstrated here can be weighed.

Abstract 393 of 500

Recently, polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) has been suggested as a good alternative laxative to lactulose as a treatment option in paediatric constipation. However, no large randomised controlled trials exist evaluating the efficacy of either laxative. To compare PEG 3350 (Transipeg: polyethylene glycol with electrolytes) with lactulose in paediatric constipation and evaluate clinical efficacy/side effects. One hundred patients (aged 6 months-15 years) with paediatric constipation were included in an eight week double blinded, randomised, controlled trial. After faecal disimpaction, patients <6 years of age received PEG 3350 (2.95 g/sachet) or lactulose (6 g/sachet) while children > or =6 years started with 2 sachets/day. Primary outcome measures were: defecation and encopresis frequency/week and successful treatment after eight weeks. Success was defined as a defecation frequency > or =3/week and encopresis < or =1 every two weeks. Secondary outcome measures were side effects after eight weeks of treatment. A total of 91 patients (49 male) completed the study. A significant increase in defecation frequency (PEG 3350: 3 pre v 7 post treatment/week; lactulose: 3 pre v 6 post/week) and a significant decrease in encopresis frequency (PEG 3350: 10 pre v 3 post/week; lactulose: 8 pre v 3 post/week) was found in both groups (NS). However, success was significantly higher in the PEG group (56%) compared with the lactulose group (29%). PEG 3350 patients reported less abdominal pain, straining, and pain at defecation than children using lactulose. However, bad taste was reported significantly more often in the PEG group. PEG 3350 (0.26 (0.11) g/kg), compared with lactulose (0.66 (0.32) g/kg), provided a higher success rate with fewer side effects. PEG 3350 should be the laxative of first choice in childhood constipation.

Abstract 394 of 500

This double-blind placebo controlled, parallel design clinical trial compared the therapeutic effects of the addition of lithium or placebo to haloperidol in 21 seriously ill state hospital patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia, who did not have concurrent affective disorders and who had not responded to previous trials of conventional antipsychotic medication. During a baseline period of 6 weeks, patients were switched to a stable dose of haloperidol (mean +/- SD dose = 13.6 +/- 8.1 mg/day). Patients were then randomized to receive either lithium or placebo in addition to haloperidol for 8 weeks (mean +/- SD lithium level = 0.98 +/- 0.13 mEq/l). Symptoms and side effects were assessed weekly. Improvement in symptoms correlated with the non-blind adjustment of antipsychotic dose, but not with lithium or placebo treatment. Side effects ratings did not differ between the two groups, but one patient developed a reversible delirium associated with combined lithium/haloperidol treatment. For these long-term, severely ill patients, combined treatment afforded no advantage over treatment with haloperidol alone.

Abstract 395 of 500

The optimal means of achieving therapeutic oral anticoagulation in the outpatient setting has not been determined. To compare a 10-mg dosing nomogram with a 5-mg nomogram that has been suggested to be sufficient for warfarin initiation. Randomized, controlled clinical trial. Outpatient venous thromboembolism services of four tertiary care hospitals. 201 of 210 consecutive patients with objectively confirmed diagnoses of acute venous thromboembolism. All patients were treated with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin for a minimum of 5 days until a therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) was achieved. Patients were randomly assigned to initially receive a 10-mg or 5-mg dose of warfarin. The primary end point was time in days to therapeutic INR. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients who had achieved a therapeutic INR by day 5, the total number of INR assessments, the number of INR measurements greater than 5.0, incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism and major bleeding, and survival. 210 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 9 were excluded and 201 were randomly assigned to study groups (104 to the 10-mg group and 97 to the 5-mg group). Demographic characteristics of both groups were similar. Patients in the 10-mg group achieved therapeutic INR 1.4 days earlier than patients in the 5-mg group (P < 0.001). Eighty-three percent of patients in the 10-mg group achieved a therapeutic INR by day 5 versus 46% in the 5-mg group (P < 0.001). Fewer INR assessments were performed in the 10-mg group than in the 5-mg group (8.1 vs. 9.1; P = 0.04). There were no significant differences between the two groups in recurrent events, major bleeding, survival, and number of INR measurements greater than 5.0. The 10-mg warfarin initiation nomogram is superior to the 5-mg nomogram because it allows more rapid achievement of a therapeutic INR.

Abstract 396 of 500

The efficacies of 200 mg of daily doses of amantadine and of rimantadine for prevention of infection and illness due to influenza A/USSR/77 (H1N1) virus were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study on a college campus. Frequencies of symptoms that might have been side effects of the drugs were not significantly different from those in placebo recipients. Analyses indicated that the trial was initiated late in the epidemic and that an age-related protective effect against A/USSR virus existed; seroconversion frequencies were 52/139 (37%) among 18-19-year-olds, 33/130 (25%) among 20-21-year-olds, and 5/39 (12.8%) among 22-24-year-olds. Among initially antibody-negative (less than 1 : 4 in complement fixing and neutralizing tests and less than 1 : 8 in hemagglutination inhibition tests) 18-19-year-old students, amantadine was associated with significantly fewer seroconversions (P = 0.01) and both less infection and milder illness than occurred in placebo recipients (P less than 0.05). Although rimantadine was not accompanied by reduction in frequency of seroconversions in the same age group, illness frequency and severity among seroconverters were significantly reduced when compared to placebo recipients (P less than 0.01). Amantadine and rimantadine appear suitable for use in young adults. Although other studies have suggested greater effectiveness of rimantadine than of amantadine against influenza, no evidence for this was seen in the present study which used both drugs at the same dose.

Abstract 398 of 500

Low-molecular-weight heparins administered subcutaneously once or twice daily have been reported to be as safe and efficacious as intravenous unfractionated heparin in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolic disease. To determine whether subcutaneous enoxaparin administered once or twice daily is as effective as continuously infused unfractionated heparin in acute symptomatic venous thromboembolic disease. Randomized, controlled, partially blinded equivalence trial. 74 hospitals in 16 countries. 900 patients with symptomatic lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis, including 287 (32%) with confirmed pulmonary embolism. Initial therapy with dose-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin compared with subcutaneous enoxaparin at fixed dosages of 1.0 mg/kg of body weight twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily. Long-term oral anticoagulation was started in all patients within 72 hours of randomization. Clinical end points assessed during a 3-month follow-up period. Equivalent efficacy was seen in the heparin group and both enoxaparin groups. Symptomatic venous thromboembolism recurred in 12 of 290 patients receiving unfractionated heparin (4.1%), 13 of 298 patients receiving once-daily enoxaparin (4.4%), and 9 of 312 patients receiving twice-daily enoxaparin (2.9%). Compared with unfractionated heparin, the treatment difference was 0.2% (95% CI, -3.04% to 3.49%) for once-daily enoxaparin and -1.2% (CI, -4.2% to 1.7%) for twice-daily enoxaparin. Incidence of major hemorrhage did not differ among the three treatment groups. Major hemorrhage occurred in 6 of 290 patients (2.1%) in the unfractionated heparin group, 5 of 298 patients (1.7%) in the once-daily enoxaparin group, and 4 of 312 patients (1.3%) in the twice-daily enoxaparin group. Subcutaneous enoxaparin once or twice daily is as effective and safe as dose-adjusted, continuously infused unfractionated heparin in the prevention of recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolic disease.

Abstract 399 of 500

The effects of diuretic therapy on body water compartments were studied in preterm infants with chronic lung disease. Gestational age of the infants ranged from 24 to 28 weeks, while the median postnatal age at the time of study was 40 days. Infants were randomized to receive furosemide (1.0 mg/kg/day) alone (n = 5) or combined with metolazone (0.2 mg/kg/day, n = 7) for 4 consecutive days. Treatment in both groups produced a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in extracellular water (ECW) without changes in plasma volume, total body water or body weight. The decrease in ECW with furosemide (503 +/- 28 to 446 +/- 19 ml/kg initial body weight) was of similar magnitude to that seen with combined furosemide plus metolazone (522 +/- 30 to 454 +/- 15 ml/kg initial body weight). Water and electrolyte intakes were similar in both groups and unchanged over the course of the study. These findings suggest that in infants with chronic lung disease, diuretic therapy induces intercompartmental shifts in body water, ultimately decreasing interstitial water while preserving PV. Only combined treatment with furosemide plus metolazone produced a significant increase in urine output, confirming the increased efficacy of combination therapy in inducing diuresis.

Abstract 400 of 500

To evaluate the effectiveness of one course of prophylactic actinomycin D in reducing the malignant sequelae requiring chemotherapy in high-risk complete hydatidiform mole (CHM). A double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was carried out at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Sixty cases of CHM classified as high risk were recruited and randomly allocated to a chemoprophylactic or control group. Within one week after evacuation of molar tissues, actinomycin D was administered in the chemoprophylactic group. Patients in the control group were given only intravenous fluid and analgesic drugs. The number of patients with malignant sequelae who required therapeutic chemotherapy after evacuation of hydatidiform mole in each group was recorded. The incidence of malignant sequelae was 13.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.9-31.7%) in the chemoprophylactic group and 50.0% (95% CI = 31.3-68.7%) in the control group. The risk reduction of malignant sequelae with one course of actinomycin D chemoprophylaxis in high-risk CHM was 72.4% (95% CI = 26.7-89.6%) (P = .005). The side effects of prophylactic chemotherapy were stomatitis, nausea/vomiting, sore throat with oral ulcer and hair loss. One course of actinomycin D given as chemoprophylaxis decreased by 72.4% malignant sequelae after evacuation of molar tissue in patients with high-risk CHM. This may be particularly beneficial in patients with high-risk CHM who cannot be followed closely, whose compliance is in question and for whom hormonal follow-up is not available or unreliable.

Abstract 401 of 500

We wished to assess the efficacy of inhaled salmeterol (SML; 50 micrograms b.i.d.) compared to a combination of slow-release theophylline and ketotifen p.o. (TK; T 300 mg+K 1 mg b.i.d.) for the treatment of nocturnal asthma. Ninety six patients with nocturnal asthma, (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 60-90% of predicted value, reversibility > or = 15%, at least two nocturnal awakenings per week) were eligible for a multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy cross-over study (14-day run-in, two successive 28-day treatment periods). Efficacy was assessed as success/failure, success being defined as the complete disappearance of nocturnal symptoms/awakening during the last week of each treatment period. There was a statistically significant difference between SML and TK for this criterion: 46% and 39% success with SML during periods I (first 28-day period) and II (following the cross-over), compared to only 15% and 26% with TK, respectively (p < 0.01). SML was also significantly better for the other criteria (lung function, rescue salbutamol intake during day and night). Side-effects were five times less frequent in SML-treated patients (p < 0.004). Efficacy and tolerance of SML were obviously far better than those of TK in patients with nocturnal asthma.

Abstract 402 of 500

To determine the comparative anti-emetic efficacy of ondansetron and granisetron in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, we performed a double-blind, randomized trial in pediatric and adult patients receiving transplants at the University of Minnesota. The results in 187 patients stratified by age (<18 years, n = 51; > or =18 years, n = 136) were analyzed. The average number of emetic episodes in the entire group from day -7 to 2 was 0.86/day for patients receiving ondansetron and 0.73/day for those receiving granisetron (p = 0.32). No differences were noted between the two drugs in total days of complete or major control of emesis or in the number of requests for additional drugs to alleviate symptoms of nausea. The use of total-body irradiation-containing conditioning regimens was associated with a decreased number of emetic episodes compared with regimens of chemotherapy alone. Perceived nausea was evaluated using a nausea scoring system, and no differences were apparent between the granisetron and ondansetron groups; however, reported nausea was significantly higher in females (p<0.01) and in the adult population (p = 0.05). We conclude that both ondansetron and granisetron provide good control of nausea and vomiting experienced with conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation. The relative cost of the drugs within an institution must be considered in developing standard anti-emetic regimens for bone marrow transplantation.

Abstract 403 of 500

The efficacy of intrauterine insemination (IUI) of selected motile sperm. Prospective randomized sequential alternating cycle trial comparing IUI with luteinizing hormone (LH)-timed intercourse. Clinical infertility service. Couples selected included unexplained infertility (n = 73), cervical mucus hostility (n = 24), moderate semen defect (n = 110), and severe semen defect (n = 78). Two hundred eighty-five couples undertook 600 IUI cycles and 505 LH-timed intercourse. Overall, IUI was slightly more effective than LH-timed intercourse with a pregnancy rate of 6.2% versus 3.4% per cycle. When individual categories were considered only, IUI for severe semen defect was significantly better (5.6% versus 1.3%, P less than 0.05). The first IUI cycle was more effective when compared with both subsequent IUI cycles and the initial LH-timed cycle. Overall, 74% (27/37) of IUI pregnancies occurred in the first cycle. Compared with LH-timed intercourse, IUI provided little or no improved expectation of pregnancy but was beneficial in couples with severe semen defect. The occurrence of pregnancy was limited per cycle and confined essentially to the initial cycle of treatment. Continued IUI is considered to be unrewarding.

Abstract 404 of 500

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 6 weeks of venlafaxine extended-release (ER) (75 mg and 150-225 mg) treatment in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study included 244 adult outpatients with metabolically stable type 1 or 2 diabetes with painful diabetic neuropathy. Primary efficacy measures were scores on the daily 100 mm Visual Analog Pain Intensity (VAS-PI) and Pain Relief (VAS-PR) scales. Secondary efficacy measures included the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement, Patient Global Rating of Pain Relief, and percentage of patients achieving 50% reduction in pain intensity. Baseline pain intensity was 68.7 mm (moderately severe). At week 6, the percentage reduction from baseline in VAS-PI was 27% (placebo), 32% (75 mg), and 50% (150-225 mg; P < 0.001 vs placebo). Mean VAS-PR scores in the 150-225 mg group were significantly greater than placebo at week 6 (44 vs 60 mm; P < 0.001). The number needed to treat (NNT) for 50% pain intensity reduction with venlafaxine ER 150-225 mg was 4.5 at week 6. Nausea and somnolence were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. Seven patients on venlafaxine had clinically important ECG changes during treatment. Venlafaxine ER appears effective and safe in relieving pain associated with diabetic neuropathy. NNT values for higher dose venlafaxine ER are comparable to those of tricyclic antidepressants and the anticonvulsant gabapentin.

Abstract 405 of 500

Preterm neonates undergoing intensive care have high morbidity from sepsis. These infants also frequently develop neutropenia, and when this is associated with sepsis, mortality is high. This study investigates the potential for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to effect a clinically relevant increase in neutrophil number when used prophylactically in high-risk preterm neonates, and assesses its safety in this population. In an open, randomized, controlled study, 75 neonates (25 small for gestational age) <32 weeks gestation were randomized to receive GM-CSF (10 microg/kg/d) by subcutaneous injection for 5 days from <72 hours after birth, or to a control group. The primary outcome measure was the neutrophil count during 14 days from study entry. The infants were monitored for potential toxicity. Clinical outcomes, sepsis, and mortality, were recorded, but this initial study was not designed to address clinical benefit. Prophylactic GM-CSF therapy completely abolished neutropenia in treated infants, when both well and septic, throughout the period of study. Neutropenia (</=1.7 x 10(9)/L) developed in 16 of 39 control infants. Five control infants experienced an acute decrease in neutrophil count coincident with the onset of sepsis. There was no evidence of hematologic, respiratory, or gastrointestinal toxicity in treated infants. Treated infants had a trend to fewer symptomatic, blood culture positive septic episodes than controls during 2 weeks from study entry (11/36 vs 18/39). Five-day prophylactic GM-CSF completely abolishes postnatal neutropenia and sepsis-induced neutropenia in preterm neonates at high risk of sepsis, and so removes an important risk factor for sepsis and sepsis-related mortality.GM-CSF, preterm neonates, neutropenia, sepsis.

Abstract 406 of 500

The relative efficacy of psychotherapy and combined therapy in the treatment of depression is still a matter of debate. To investigate whether combined therapy has advantages over psychotherapy alone. A 6-month randomised clinical trial compared Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy (n=106) with combined therapy (n=85) in ambulatory patients with mild or moderate major depressive disorder diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. Antidepressants were prescribed according to a protocol providing four successive steps in case of intolerance or inefficacy: venlafaxine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, nortriptyline and nortriptyline plus lithium. Efficacy was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Clinical Global Impression of Severity and of Improvement, and the depression sub-scale of the Symptom Checklist. The advantages of combining antidepressants with psychotherapy were equivocal. Neither the treating clinicians nor the independent observers were able to ascertain them, but the patients experienced them clearly. The advantages of combining antidepressants with psychotherapy are equivocal.

Abstract 407 of 500

A prospective study comparing three management schemes for patients at term with premature rupture of membranes was performed. One hundred forty patients were randomized to one of three study groups: prostaglandin E2, placebo, or oxytocin. Patients randomized to prostaglandin E2 and placebo received vaginal suppositories containing 3 mg prostaglandin E2 or glycerin only, respectively; suppositories were administered in a double-blind fashion, on one or two occasions, 6 hours apart. Oxytocin was given only if labor was not established after 12 hours or to augment inadequate labor. In patients randomized to oxytocin labor was induced with intravenous oxytocin. The time interval to delivery, delivery outcome, and complications were analyzed. Patients receiving prostaglandin E2 were more likely to be in labor after one suppository and to be delivered without the addition of oxytocin when compared with placebo. The time interval to delivery was shorter with prostaglandin E2 and oxytocin induction versus placebo ("expectant management"). The incidence of maternal infection was lowest in patients with labor induced by prostaglandin E2. Although the overall cesarean section rate was low, there was a trend toward a lower rate with prostaglandin E2 induction. No adverse effects were observed with prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 can be used successfully to induce labor after premature rupture of membranes at term with greater ease of administration when compared with oxytocin.

Abstract 408 of 500

We hypothesized that using a higher dose of erythropoietin (Epo) and starting treatment on the first day of life would reduce the transfusion requirements of ventilator-dependent and non-ventilator-dependent very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Moreover, we hypothesized that this treatment would be cost-effective. We randomly assigned 20 ill newborn VLBW infants to receive either Epo (200 units/kg per day) or placebo during their first 2 weeks of life. The caregivers were unaware of the treatment assignments, and erythrocyte transfusions were administered according to hematocrit and signs of anemia. On day 1, reticulocyte counts and hematocrits were similar in the two groups. During the subsequent 2 weeks, reticulocyte counts of the placebo recipients fell significantly below those of the Epo recipients, but hematocrits in the two groups did not differ. More transfusions were received by the placebo recipients (mean = 1.4 per patient) than by the Epo recipients (mean = 0.2 per patient; p < 0.01). No adverse effects of Epo were noted, and the costs in the placebo group exceeded those in the Epo group. We conclude that administration of Epo to VLBW infants during the first 2 weeks of life results in fewer transfusions and is cost-effective.

Abstract 409 of 500

To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of irritability in children and adolescents with autistic disorder. Two hundred eighteen children and adolescents (aged 6-17 years) with a diagnosis of autistic disorder, and with behaviors such as tantrums, aggression, self-injurious behavior, or a combination of these symptoms, were randomized 1:1:1:1 to aripiprazole (5, 10, or 15 mg/day) or placebo in this 8-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Efficacy was evaluated using the caregiver-rated Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale (primary efficacy measure) and the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. At week 8, all aripiprazole doses produced significantly greater improvement than placebo in mean Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale scores (5 mg/day, -12.4; 10 mg/day, -13.2; 15 mg/day, -14.4; versus placebo, -8.4; all p < .05). All aripiprazole doses demonstrated significantly greater improvements in mean Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement score than placebo at week 8. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were as follows: placebo 7.7%, aripiprazole 5 mg/day 9.4%, 10 mg/day 13.6%, and 15 mg/day 7.4%. The most common adverse event leading to discontinuation was sedation. There were two serious adverse events: presyncope (5 mg/day) and aggression (10 mg/day). At week 8, mean weight change (last observation carried forward) was as follows: placebo +0.3 kg, aripiprazole 5 mg/day +1.3 kg, 10 mg/day +1.3 kg, and 15 mg/day +1.5 kg; all p < .05 versus placebo. Aripiprazole was efficacious and generally safe and well tolerated in the treatment of children and adolescents with irritability associated with autistic disorder.

Abstract 410 of 500

The inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate, was compared with the oral bronchodilator theophylline in the maintenance treatment of asthma. The objective of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety of twice-daily inhaled fluticasone propionate, 50 micrograms, and fluticasone propionate, 100 micrograms, with that of theophylline in the maintenance treatment of mild-to-moderate asthma. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 353 adult and adolescent patients with asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled beta-agonist therapy alone received fluticasone propionate, 50 micrograms, or fluticasone propionate, 100 micrograms, by metered-dose inhaler; theophylline capsules; or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Only inhaled albuterol was permitted as needed for acute symptoms. Both fluticasone propionate groups had a significantly greater probability of remaining in the study (ie, meeting asthma stability criteria) than did either the theophylline or placebo group (P < or = .008); 39% and 51% in the theophylline and placebo groups, respectively, were withdrawn due to lack of treatment efficacy compared with 14% and 21% in the fluticasone propionate, 50 micrograms, and fluticasone propionate, 100 micrograms, groups. Both fluticasone propionate groups experienced significantly greater improvement in FEV1 and PEF compared with patients in the theophylline or placebo group (P < or = .004). The incidence of potentially drug-related adverse events was significantly greater in the theophylline group (25%) than in the placebo group (11%) (P = .031), while there were no differences between placebo and fluticasone propionate, 50 micrograms, (18%) or fluticasone propionate 100 micrograms, (22%). Twice daily treatment with inhaled fluticasone propionate 50 micrograms or 100 micrograms was significantly more effective than theophylline in the treatment of mild-to-moderate asthma.

Abstract 411 of 500

Treatment with heparin or streptokinase was allocated randomly to 30 patients with life-threatening pulmonary embolism verified by angiography. Treatment was given for 72 hours and pulmonary angiography was repeated. There was significantly greater (P < 0.001) evidence of thrombolysis in those patients treated with streptokinase compared with those treated with heparin. The reduction of systolic and mean pulmonary arterial pressures was also significantly greater (P < 0.05 and P < 0.02 respectively) in the streptokinase group.Seven patients failed to complete 72 hours of the trial treatment: five successfully underwent pulmonary embolectomy. Six of these "failures" had initial pulmonary angiographic scores of 24 or more and systemic systolic blood pressure recordings of 100 mm Hg or less. Patients with these features should probably be considered for pulmonary embolectomy as the initial treatment.A febrile reaction commonly occurred in the streptokinase group; otherwise side effects were no more common than in the heparin group.

Abstract 413 of 500

Hepatic injury secondary to warm ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and alterations in haemostatic parameters are often unavoidable events after major hepatic resection. The release of inflammatory mediator is believed to play a significant role in the genesis of these events. It has been suggested that preoperative steroid administration may reduce I/R injury and improve several aspects of the surgical stress response. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to investigate the clinical benefits on I/R injury and systemic responses of preoperatively administered corticosteroids. Seventy-six patients undergoing liver resection were randomized either to a steroid group or to a control group. Patients in the steroid group received preoperatively 500 mg of methylprednisolone. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, coagulation parameters, and inflammatory mediators, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were compared between the 2 groups. Length of stay, and type and number of complications were recorded as well. Postoperative serum levels of ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and inflammatory cytokines were significantly lower in the steroid than in the control group at postoperative days 1 and 2. Changes in hemostatic parameters were also significantly attenuated in the steroid group. In conclusion, the incidence of postoperative complications in the steroid group tended to be significantly lower than the control group. It is of clinical interest that preoperative steroids administration before major surgery may reduce I/R injury, maintain coagulant/anticoagulant homeostasis, and reduce postoperative complications by modulating the inflammatory response.

Abstract 414 of 500

We report on the results of a study comparing mianserin with amitriptyline and placebo, in outpatients with major depression (DSM-III 296.2 or 296.3). One hundred and forty-nine patients were randomized to mianserin (n = 50), amitriptyline (n = 50) or placebo (n = 49). Medication was taken in a nightly (qhs) dose. During Week 1, the maximum dose was 60 mg mianserin, 120 mg amitriptyline or two placebo capsules. Beginning at Day 7 (through Day 42) maximum dosages were 150 mg mianserin, 300 mg amitriptyline or five placebo capsules. At multiple weeks and endpoint, statistically significant reductions in the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) 17- and 21-item scores were recorded for both active drugs compared with placebo. Positive results with the HAM-D were corroborated by other measures of efficacy. There were no statistically significant differences between mianserin and amitriptyline in terms of efficacy; however, the results do suggest a more rapid therapeutic response for mianserin compared with amitriptyline, in terms of percentage of patients showing > or = 50% improvement at Weeks 2 (30% vs 23%) and 4 (61% vs 44%). The most common adverse experiences were somnolence (amitriptyline and mianserin 60%, placebo 31%) and dry mouth (amitriptyline 76%, mianserin 30% and placebo 20%). Our results indicate that mianserin is clearly superior to placebo, compares favorably with amitriptyline, and is a safe, well-tolerated, effective medication in the treatment of depressed outpatients.

Abstract 415 of 500

A randomised controlled trial of theophylline versus face-mask continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) treatment for recurrent apnoea of immaturity was carried out in 32 infants of 25 to 32 weeks' gestation. Continuous recording of electrocardiogram and impedence pneumogram added objective assessment to the nurses' observations for 11 courses of treatment. The CPAP group had more adverse perinatal factors but the frequency of apnoeic attacks before treatment was comparable. Infants given theophylline had a greater reduction in the incidence of prolonged apnoeic attacks, and this difference persisted after allowing for the effect of perinatal complications. Continuous recordings showed a greater reduction in episodes of bradycardia of less than or equal to 80/minute with theophylline. Five of 18 infants given theophylline needed intermittent positive pressure ventilation for apnoea compared with 12 of 14 given CPAP. The poor response in 17 of 32 infants suggests a need for a more effective method of preventing or treating apnoea in very immature babies, in whom adverse perinatal factors often coexist.

Abstract 416 of 500

The efficacy and safety of abciximab were investigated in Japanese patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina. The 973 patients were randomized into 3 groups: the low-dose group (L group) received bolus injection of 0.20 mg/kg followed by 12-h infusion; the high-dose group (H group) received bolus injection of 0.25 mg/kg followed by 12-h infusion; the placebo group (P group) received bolus and infusion of placebo. The incidence of the primary endpoint (30-day post-PCI coronary events: death, MI or urgent revascularization) was 3.6%, 1.6%, and 4.1% in the P, L, and H groups, respectively, with no significant difference between the P and L groups (P=0.104) or between the P and H groups (P=0.772). The incidence of bleeding tended to increase in a dose-dependent manner. No significant difference in the incidence of coronary events was found between the placebo and abciximab groups, so the efficacy of abciximab in preventing post-PCI coronary events in Japanese patients was not confirmed.

Abstract 418 of 500

This report presents the clinical results three months after application of minocycline microspheres as an adjunct to mechanical treatment of incipient peri-implant infections compared to adjunctive treatment employing 1% chlorhexidine gel application. Sixteen patients in the minocycline group and 14 in the chlorhexidine group completed the study. Each patient had one or more implants with probing depth > or = 4 mm combined with bleeding and/or exudate on probing and presence of putative pathogenic bacteria. At baseline, patients were randomly assigned to minocycline or chlorhexidine treatment. Follow-up examinations were carried out after 10, 30, 60 and 90 days. The combined mechanical/antimicrobial treatment for the chlorhexidine group did not result in any reduction in probing depth and only limited reduction of bleeding scores. The adjunctive use of minocycline microspheres, on the other hand, resulted in improvements in both probing depths and bleeding scores. For the deepest sites of the treated implants, mean probing depth was reduced from 5.0 mm to 4.1 mm. The reductions in bleeding scores, although greater than for the chlorhexidine group, were modest. Thus, the question as to what extent the combined mechanical/minocycline treatment could be considered adequate for the treated lesions remains to be answered. The present short-term findings, however, encourage further studies with longer observation intervals on adjunctive use of minocycline microspheres in the treatment of periimplant lesions.

Abstract 419 of 500

Palivizumab reduces respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization in children at high risk by approximately 50% compared with placebo. We compared the efficacy and safety of motavizumab, an investigational monoclonal antibody with enhanced anti-RSV activity in preclinical studies, with palivizumab. This randomized, double-blind, multinational, phase 3, noninferiority trial assessed safety and RSV hospitalization in 6635 preterm infants aged <or=6 months at enrollment or children aged <or=24 months with chronic lung disease of prematurity who received 15 mg/kg palivizumab or motavizumab monthly. Secondary end points included outpatient medically attended lower respiratory tract infections (MALRIs), RSV-specific LRIs, otitis media, antibiotic use, development of antimotavizumab antibodies, and motavizumab serum concentrations. Motavizumab recipients had a 26% relative reduction in RSV hospitalization compared with palivizumab recipients, achieving noninferiority. Motavizumab was superior to palivizumab for reduction of RSV-specific outpatient MALRIs (50% relative reduction). Overall, adverse events (AEs) were not significantly different between groups. Cutaneous events were reported in 2 percentage points more motavizumab recipients (7.2% vs 5.1%); most were mild, but 0.3% resulted in dosing discontinuation. Antidrug antibodies (ADA) were detected in 1.8% of motavizumab recipients. Patients with anti-drug antibody reported 6 RSV events and 17 cutaneous events. Children receiving prophylaxis with motavizumab or palivizumab had low rates of RSV hospitalization; motavizumab recipients experienced 50% fewer RSV MALRIs than palivizumab recipients. AEs were similar in both groups, although cutaneous AEs were higher for motavizumab recipients. Motavizumab may offer an improved alternative in prophylaxis for serious RSV disease in infants and children at high risk.

Abstract 420 of 500

Because cats are a common pet in many houses and tourist complexes in the Canary Islands, sensitization to cat epithelium is a frequent problem. A total of 19.2% of patients with intrinsic asthma are sensitized to cat epithelium. In the Canary Islands, the percentage of sensitization among patients with a household cat is 18.1%, which higher is higher than in the rest of Spain (11.9). Many patients with extrinsic asthma sensitized to house dust mites undergo conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy but evolution is unsatisfactory due to sensitization to cat epithelium (whether a cat is present or not). The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy with extract of cat epithelium in monosensitized patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and/or bronchial asthma. Forty patients monosensitized to cat epithelium were selected. Of these, 20 were administered sublingual immunotherapy and another 20 received placebo. The following evaluation was carried out in both groups: in vivo and in vitro: symptom score, skin tests, nasal challenge with cat epithelium, specific IgE determination, specific IgG4 and eosinophilic cationic protein. After 1 year of treatment the cumulative dose was 3.6 micrograms of Fe ld I, equivalent to 10 ng/drop. Duration of treatment was 365 days. Our conclusions, based on our patients in the Canary Islands, were the following: 1. Sublingual Fel d I therapy is effective after 1 year of treatment. 2. There were no modifications in IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein or skin tests. 3. An increase in IgG4 occurred which was related to clinical improvement. 4. In general, tolerance was good, except in one patient who presented urticaria and sublingual pruritus. 5. In polysensitized patients, sublingual immunotherapy to cat epithelium is complementary to immunotherapy to dermatophagoides.

Abstract 421 of 500

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing droperidol 1.25 mg intravenously (i.v.) (group 1, n = 30), ondansetron 4 mg i.v. (group 2, n = 30), or both (group 3, n = 30) in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the first 24 h following major gynaecological procedures under combined general and epidural anaesthesia. PONV was analysed by a linear nausea/vomiting score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and the need for antiemetic rescue. Our results showed a similar incidence of nausea and vomiting in all groups (G1 33%, G2 40%, G3 43%). However, when comparisons were made according to the time of assessment, combination therapy resulted in significantly lower PONV than droperidol in the first hour (0% vs. 13%, P < 0.05) and second hour (0% vs. 13%, P < 0.05), and than ondansetron on the first hour (0% vs. 13%, P < 0.05). A trend persisted up to the fourth hour but was not statistically significant in either group. In conclusion, droperidol and ondansetron are effective agents in the prevention of PONV, and their combination seems to provide slightly better results than either drug alone.

Abstract 422 of 500

In septic shock, the alteration of the gut barrier contributes to the development of multiple organ failure. The aim of the study was to compare epinephrine with the combination of dobutamine and norepinephrine on gastric perfusion in patients with septic shock. In a prospective randomized study on 2 parallel groups, systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics (arterial and Swan-Ganz catheters), gastric mucosal blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry technique), hepatic function (indocyanine green clearance), and blood gases were evaluated just before catecholamine infusion and when mean arterial pressure reached 70 to 80 mm Hg. Epinephrine or norepinephrine were titrated (from 0.1 microg/kg per minute, with 0.2 microg/kg per minute increases every 5 minutes). Dobutamine was continuously infused at 5 microg/kg per minute. Twenty-two patients were included (11 in each group). At randomization there was no significant difference between groups. At the time of evaluation, mean arterial pressure was 78 +/- 3 and 77 +/- 5 mm Hg in the epinephrine and dobutamine-norepinephrine groups, respectively. There was no significant difference between groups regardless of the systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic or blood gas variable considered. Nevertheless, compared with dobutamine-norepinephrine, epinephrine tended to induce greater values for cardiac index (5.0 +/- 1.6 versus 4.2 +/- 1.5 L/min per square meter; P =.078) and oxygen transport (617 +/- 166 versus 481 +/- 229 mL/min per square meter; P =.068). Epinephrine also induced significantly greater values of gastric mucosal blood flow (662 +/- 210 versus 546 +/- 200 units; P =.011) but did not modify indocyanine green clearance. In patients with septic shock, at doses that induced the same mean arterial pressure, epinephrine enhanced more gastric mucosal blood flow than the combination of dobutamine at 5 microg/kg per minute and norepinephrine. This effect was probably a result of higher cardiac index.

Abstract 423 of 500

Varenicline, a partial agonist at the alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, has the potential to aid smoking cessation by relieving nicotine withdrawal symptoms and reducing the rewarding properties of nicotine. To determine the efficacy and safety of varenicline for smoking cessation compared with placebo or sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between June 2003 and March 2005 at 14 research centers with a 12-week treatment period and follow-up of smoking status to week 52. Of 1413 adult smokers who volunteered for the study, 1027 were enrolled; 65% of randomized participants completed the study. Varenicline titrated to 1 mg twice daily (n = 344) or bupropion SR titrated to 150 mg twice daily (n = 342) or placebo (n = 341) for 12 weeks, plus weekly brief smoking cessation counseling. Continuous abstinence from smoking during the last 4 weeks of treatment (weeks 9-12; primary end point) and through the follow-up period (weeks 9-24 and 9-52). During the last 4 weeks of treatment (weeks 9-12), 43.9% of participants in the varenicline group were continuously abstinent from smoking compared with 17.6% in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR], 3.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.69-5.50; P<.001) and 29.8% in the bupropion SR group (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38-2.62; P<.001). For weeks 9 through 24, 29.7% of participants in the varenicline group were continuously abstinent compared with 13.2% in the placebo group (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.91-4.19; P<.001) and 20.2% in the bupropion group (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.19-2.42; P = .003). For weeks 9 through 52, 23% of participants in the varenicline group were continuously abstinent compared with 10.3% in the placebo group (OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.72-4.11; P<.001) and 14.6% in the bupropion SR group (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.19-2.63; P = .004). Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events by 10.5% of participants in the varenicline group, 12.6% in the bupropion SR group, and 7.3% in the placebo group. The most common adverse event with varenicline was nausea, which occurred in 101 participants (29.4%). Varenicline is an efficacious, safe, and well-tolerated smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. Varenicline's short-term and long-term efficacy exceeded that of both placebo and bupropion SR. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00143364.

Abstract 424 of 500

The objectives of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized dose-ranging study were 1) to examine the safety and tolerability of tirofiban (MK-383), a new nonpeptide platelet IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, on a background of intravenous heparin and aspirin therapy; 2) to study the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of tirofiban; and 3) to evaluate the incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes (urgent repeat revascularization, myocardial infarction and death) with tirofiban versus placebo in a high risk subset of patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Abrupt vessel closure complicates 4% to 8% of angioplasty procedures. Recent data have suggested that agents that antagonize the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor may reduce the incidence of adverse ischemic outcomes after coronary angioplasty. Seventy-three patients received tirofiban in three sequential dose panels and 20 patients received placebo. Patients within each panel were randomized to receive either tirofiban or placebo in a 3:1 randomization design. Bolus doses of 5, 10 and 10 microg/kg and continuous infusion (16 to 24 h) doses of 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 microg/kg per min were administered in panels I, II and III, respectively. Patients received concomitant heparin and aspirin for the angioplasty procedure. Data on patients receiving placebo (heparin and aspirin only) were pooled across panels for comparisons. The pharmacodynamic effect of tirofiban on ex vivo platelet aggregation to 5 micromol/liter adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and bleeding times were measured. Clinical outcomes were assessed in all patients, but the power to detect clinically meaningful differences (a one-third reduction in clinical events) between groups was limited (5%). Tirofiban was associated with a dose-dependent inhibition of ex vivo ADP-mediated platelet aggregation that was sustained during intravenous infusion and resolved rapidly after drug cessation. Adverse bleeding events, largely related to vascular access site hemorrhage, were slightly increased at the highest dose. Adverse clinical outcomes were infrequent in all patients and were not different among the small number of patients within each group. This study establishes a rational and generally well tolerated dosing regimen for administration of tirofiban as adjunctive therapy in high risk angioplasty patients. The impact of tirofiban on adverse clinical outcomes after angioplasty awaits definition by a larger clinical trial.

Abstract 425 of 500

Dose reduction strategies for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia are designed to maintain the benefits of antipsychotic drug therapy while reducing risks. Previous strategies with decanoate preparations have been based on the use of lower doses per injection to achieve dose reduction; these strategies have achieved dose reduction but have resulted in some increase in symptoms. The authors tested a new dose reduction approach: increasing the interval between injections during intramuscular decanoate antipsychotic treatment. Fifty outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of fluphenazine decanoate intramuscularly either every 2 weeks or every 6 weeks for 54 weeks in a double-blind design. The two dose regimens did not differ significantly in relapse, symptom, or side effect measures. The every-6-weeks regimen was associated with a significant reduction in total antipsychotic exposure. The use of injections every 6 weeks instead of every 2 weeks may increase compliance and improve patients' comfort as well as decrease cumulative antipsychotic exposure, without increasing relapse rates or symptoms.

Abstract 426 of 500

We compared the effectiveness and incidence of nephrotoxicity of ampicillin-tobramycin and cefotaxime in 73 cirrhotics who had severe bacterial infection. Most of these patients had spontaneous peritonitis and/or bacteremia. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Group I included 36 patients treated with ampicillin-tobramycin and Group II comprised 37 patients treated with cefotaxime. Patients from both groups were similar with respect to clinical data, standard liver and renal function tests, types of infection and isolated organisms. Ninety-two per cent of bacteria isolated in Group I and 98% of those isolated in Group II were susceptible in vitro to ampicillin-tobramycin and to cefotaxime, respectively. Ampicillin-tobramycin cured the infection in 56% of Group I patients, and cefotaxime in 85% of Group II patients (p less than 0.02). Five patients treated with ampicillin-tobramycin, and none treated with cefotaxime developed superinfections (p = 0.024). Nephrotoxicity (impairment of renal function associated with an increase of urinary beta 2-microglobulin to over 2,000 micrograms per liter) occurred in two patients in Group I and none in Group II. These results suggest that broad-spectrum cephalosporins should be considered as first choice antibiotics in cirrhotic patients with severe infections.

Abstract 427 of 500

Rates of smoking in East Asian men range from >35% to >60%, and are increasing in women and the young. This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of 1 mg BID varenicline, a novel alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, for smoking cessation in smokers in Taiwan and Korea. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week treatment, 12-week follow-up trial was conducted at 5 sites each in Korea and Taiwan. Eligible subjects, smoking >or=10 cigarettes/d, received brief smoking-cessation counseling and were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to varenicline 1 mg BID (titrated during the first week) or placebo. Smoking status was established by self-report and confirmed at clinic visits by end-expiratory carbon monoxide <or=10 ppm. The primary end point was continuous abstinence rate (CAR) during the last 4 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points included CAR from weeks 9 to 24 and 7-day point prevalence (PP) of abstinence at weeks 12 and 24. Craving, withdrawal, and smoking satisfaction were determined by the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale, the Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges, and the modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire. Observed or volunteered adverse-event data were recorded at clinic visits. Overall, 126 subjects (84.9% male) received varenicline, and 124 (92.7% male) received placebo, Subjects were aged 21 to 73 years (mean age, 39.7 and 40.9 years for varenicline and placebo groups, respectively), and the mean (range) body weights were 69.0 (44.8-110.0) kg and 71.4 (45.5-102.0) kg, respectively. Subjects had smoked for 3 to 52 years (mean, 20.2 and 22.1 years in the varenicline and placebo groups, respectively). Subjects had smoked a mean of 23 cigarettes/d over the past month, with 51.6% (varenicline) and 46.0% (placebo) having made 1 or more prior serious quit attempts. Smoking-cessation rates at the end of treatment were 59.5% with varenicline versus 32.3% with placebo (P < 0.001). CARs through 12 weeks post-treatment (weeks 9-24) were 46.8% with varenicline and 21.8% with placebo (P < 0.001). The 7-day PP was 67.5% with varenicline versus 36.3% with placebo at week 12, and 57.1% versus 29.0% with placebo at week 24 (both, P < 0.001). Treatment-emergent, all-causality adverse events with an incidence >or= 5% for varenicline were nausea (43.7% for varenicline vs 11.3% placebo), insomnia (15.1% vs 13.7%), increased appetite (7.9% vs 6.5%), constipation (7.1% vs 2.4%), anxiety (5.6% vs 2.4%), and abnormal dreams (5.6% vs 0.8%). Adverse events resulted in <10% treatment discontinuations overall. Varenicline was an efficacious and well-tolerated pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in this group of Asian smokers over a 12-week treatment period, and its effects persisted for a further 12-week follow-up period.

Abstract 429 of 500

To test the efficacy of a combined alpha- and beta-receptor agonist in acute bronchiolitis, we compared inhaled racemic epinephrine with salbutamol in a double-blind, crossover, randomized protocol. Twenty-four infants, 4.6 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SEM) months of age, with their first episode of bronchiolitis were tested. After sedation with chloral hydrate, a clinical score and pulmonary mechanics measurements using simultaneous signals of airflow volume and transpulmonary pressure were recorded. After baseline measurements, infants received either nebulized salbutamol, 0.03 ml/kg, or racemic epinephrine, 0.1 ml/kg. Thirty minutes later, there was a significant decrease in clinical score after treatment with racemic epinephrine compared with the baseline score (p < 0.001); this difference was not present after salbutamol inhalation (p = 0.42). Only 13 patients had a decrease in clinical score after salbutamol therapy, in comparison with 20 infants treated with racemic epinephrine (p < 0.01). Both drug decreased respiratory rate, but the decrease was greater after the use of racemic epinephrine (p < 0.001). There was a significant decrease in inspiratory, expiratory, and total pulmonary resistance after treatment with racemic epinephrine compared with baseline values (p < 0.01) but no significant change after salbutamol inhalation. There was no significant correlation between the clinical score and pulmonary mechanics either at baseline or after drug treatment. We conclude that racemic epinephrine is superior to salbutamol in the treatment of infants with their first episode of acute bronchiolitis.

Abstract 430 of 500

1. Cardiologists and pharmacists at the University Hospital of Wales collaborated to write 20 individual leaflets incorporating guidelines for a range of drugs used in the treatment of cardiology patients. The Plain English Campaign advised on the intelligibility and presentation of the information. 2. One hundred and twenty-five patients from the Regional Cardiology Unit, University Hospital of Wales were randomly allocated to receive usual verbal counselling about their drug treatment with or without an individualised drug information wallet. Two weeks after discharge from hospital patients completed a postal questionnaire to determine their satisfaction with the information about their drug treatment and their understanding of it. Forty-nine questionnaires were returned from the leaflet group and 52 from the control group. 3. The provision of written guidelines resulted in significant improvements in patients' satisfaction with their drug treatment (chi 2 = 33.3, P less than 0.001) and their understanding of it (P less than 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). Overall, patients who received leaflets were more likely to be aware of the potential side effects of their drugs but less likely to be apprehensive about them. Succinct guidelines concerning drug therapy can be assimilated by cardiology patients and provide them with a permanent record for future reference.

Abstract 431 of 500

To compare the prophylactic administration of ondansetron plus droperidol, droperidol plus metoclopramide, and perphenazine to determine effects on postoperative nausea, vomiting, and sedation after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Prospective, randomized, double-blind study. University medical center. 212 ASA physical status I and II adults presenting for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of three prophylactic antiemetic drug combinations: ondansetron 4 mg plus droperidol 0.625 mg (Group OD), droperidol 0.625 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg (Group DM), or perphenazine 5 mg (Group P). Study drugs were administered intravenously after induction of general anesthesia. The groups were similar with respect to gender, age, weight, duration of surgery, numbers of patients receiving intraoperative atropine or ephedrine, number admitted overnight, and time to discharge home. Patients in Group P used lower total doses of opioids than did patients in Group OD. There were no significant differences in postoperative nausea, pain, or sedation scores, in numbers of patients requiring antiemetics (Group OD, 13 of 66; Group DM, 15 of 66; Group P, 14 of 68), or in numbers of patients vomiting, either in hospital or during the first postoperative day. These three drug regimens are equivalent for antiemetic prophylaxis before laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Abstract 432 of 500

Relentless chronic pulmonary inflammation is the major contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). While immunomodulating therapies such as prednisolone and ibuprofen may be beneficial, their use is limited by side effects. Macrolides have immunomodulatory properties and long term use dramatically improves prognosis in diffuse panbronchiolitis, a condition with features in common with the lung disease of CF. To determine if azithromycin (AZM) improves clinical parameters and reduces inflammation in patients with CF, a 3 month prospective randomised double blind, placebo controlled study of AZM (250 mg/day) was undertaken in adults with CF. Monthly assessment included lung function, weight, and quality of life (QOL). Blood and sputum collection assessed systemic inflammation and changes in bacterial flora. Respiratory exacerbations were treated according to the policy of the CF Unit. Sixty patients were recruited (29 men) of mean (SD) age 27.9 (6.5) years and initial forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 56.6 (22.3)% predicted. FEV1% and forced vital capacity (FVC)% predicted were maintained in the AZM group while in the placebo group there was a mean (SE) decline of -3.62 (1.78)% (p=0.047) and -5.73 (1.66)% (p=0.001), respectively. Fewer courses of intravenous antibiotics were used in patients on AZM (0.37 v 1.13, p=0.016). Median C reactive protein (CRP) levels declined in the AZM group from 10 to 5.4 mg/ml but remained constant in the placebo group (p<0.001). QOL improved over time in patients on AZM and remained unchanged in those on placebo (p=0.035). AZM in adults with CF significantly improved QOL, reduced CRP levels and the number of respiratory exacerbations, and reduced the rate of decline in lung function. Long term AZM may have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Further studies are required to define frequency of dosing and duration of benefit.

Abstract 433 of 500

In a double-blind, randomized, controlled study, the effectiveness of treatment with a combination of Benfotiamine (an Allithiamine, a lipid-soluble derivative of vitamin B1 with high bioavailability) plus vitamin B6/B12 on objective parameters of neuropathy was studied over a period of 12 weeks on 24 diabetic patients with diabetic polyneuropathy. The results showed a significant improvement (p = 0.006) of nerve conduction velocity in the peroneal nerve and a statistical trend toward improvement of the vibration perception threshold. Long-term observation of 9 patients with verum over a period of 9 months support the results. Therapy-specific adverse effects were not seen. The results of this double-blind investigation, of the long-term observation and of the reports in the literature support the contention that the neurotropic benfotiamine-vitamin B combination represents a starting point in the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy.

Abstract 434 of 500

To examine whether a year long programme based on the transtheoretical model of behaviour change, incorporating three sessions using an expert system computer program and three class lessons, could reduce the prevalence of teenage smoking. Cluster randomised trial comparing the intervention to a control group exposed only to health education as part of the English national curriculum. 52 schools in the West Midlands region. Participants: 8352 students in year 9 (age 13-14 years) at those schools. Prevalence of teenage smoking 12 months after the start of the intervention. Of the 8352 students recruited, 7444 (89.1%) were followed up at 12 months. The intention to treat odds ratio for smoking in the intervention group relative to control was 1.08 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.33). Sensitivity analysis for loss to follow up and adjustment for potential confounders did not alter these findings. The smoking prevention and cessation intervention based on the transtheoretical model, as delivered in this trial, is ineffective in schoolchildren aged 13-14.

Abstract 435 of 500

A randomized comparative study of 387 consecutive patients admitted for induction of labor was carried out using two orally administered oxytocics (prostaglandin E2 tablets (Prostin) or Demoxytocin resoriblets for buccal administration (Sandopart)), the results of which are reported here. One-hundred and twenty-three cases were suitable for primary amniotomy; of these 48 were given PGE2 tablets and 75 received demoxytocin resoriblets. In a further 264 cases, primary amniotomy was inadvisable and of these, 133 patients were allotted to the PGE2 treatment group and 131 to treatment with demoxytocin. A significantly higher success rate was observed (p less than 0.05) in the PGE2 group in cases where primary amniotomy had been carried out, as compared with the demoxytocin group. Parturition was successfully induced in 82.0% of the patients given PGE2 tablets, as against only 63.4% of those receiving demoxytocin following 2 days of stimulation without primary amniotomy. This difference is statistically significant at the 0.001 level, and presumably due to the highly significant difference (p less than 0.0001) between patients with a Bishop score of 5 or less, where induction was successful in 75.4% given PGE2 tablets, in contrast to a success rate of only 36.7% in patients receiving demoxytocin resoriblets. No difference was observed in the success rate between the two treatment groups when the Bishop score was 6 or more. No difference was recorded in the incidence of fetal distress, instrumental delivery or low Apgar score between the two treatment groups. However, a higher incidence of vomiting and diarrhea were observed in patients treated with PGE2 tablets (11%) as compared with those receiving demoxytocin (1.5%). There was no difference with regard to the induction-delivery time, nor to the different stages of labor between otherwise comparable treatment groups when the induction was successful. It is concluded in respect of induction of labor using orally administered oxytocics that PGE2 (tablets) are preferable to demoxytocin (resoriblets) as it is the more effective of the two.

Abstract 436 of 500

An open randomized comparison of two-fixed dose artemisinin derivative-containing combination regimens was conducted in adults with acute uncomplicated multidrug resistant falciparum malaria in Thailand. DNP, a combination of dihydroartemisinin with napthoquine and trimethoprim developed recently in China, has been evaluated in China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. This study was performed to compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of DNP and artemether-lumefantrine/Coartem. One hundred and thirty eligible uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients were enrolled into the study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio into group A, which received DNP one tablet twice a day for one day; and group B, which received Coartem/Riamet four tablets twice a day for 3 days. The cure rates at 28-day were 99% and 97% in group A and group B, respectively. No serious adverse events occurred. We concluded that both DNP and Coartem/ Riamet were safe, well tolerated and highly efficacious in the treatment of acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Thailand.

Abstract 437 of 500

to compare the effects of two different exercise programmes after hip fracture. assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial. hospital rehabilitation units, with continued intervention at home. 160 people with surgical fixation for hip fracture transferred to inpatient rehabilitation. in addition to other rehabilitation strategies, the intervention group received a higher dose (60 min/day) exercise programme conducted whilst standing and the control group received a lower dose exercise programme (30 min/day) primarily conducted whilst seated/supine. The primary outcome measures were knee extensor muscle strength in the fractured leg and walking speed, measured at 4 and 16 weeks. 150 participants (94% of those recruited) completed the trial. There were no differences between the groups for the two primary outcome measures. Post hoc analyses revealed increased walking speed among those in the higher dose, weight-bearing exercise group with cognitive impairment at 4 and 16 weeks. there was no benefit (or harm) due to the higher dose, weight-bearing exercise programme with respect to the primary outcome measures. However, people with hip fracture and cognitive impairment gained greater benefit from the higher dose programme than from the lower dose programme.

Abstract 438 of 500

A randomized polycentric study was programmed to establish the effects of daily administration of ferritin iron from early pregnancy to puerperium. 254 women with normal iron balance at the beginning of their pregnancy were randomized receiving no supplements or 40 mg iron daily. At the end of pregnancy iron balance was still normal only in one third of the pregnant women of the first group versus two third of the second group. 204 women who were iron-deficient received daily 40 or 120 mg of iron; in this group anemia developed less frequently (13% versus 29%) and iron balance normalized in one subject on four; the great majority of these women remained iron-deficient. Unwanted effects of minimal or mild relevance, and almost always sporadic were observed in 6.5% of cases and with the reduction or withdraw of the treatment in only 1.4% of cases. These results showed that daily administration of ferritin iron during pregnancy is effective and well tolerated; furthermore they suggest that the treatment must be done with at least 60 mg daily in women with normal iron balance and protracted also after the puerperium in iron deficient subjects.

Abstract 439 of 500

To evaluate the impact of sumatriptan succinate injection compared with placebo on productivity loss during a migraine attack in the workplace. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Fifteen clinical centers in the United States. One hundred thirty-five patients 18 years and older diagnosed as having migraine according to International Headache Society criteria. Patients self-administered sumatriptan injection (6 mg) or matching placebo to treat a moderate or severe migraine occurring within the first 4 hours of a minimum 8-hour work shift. Mean productivity loss 2 hours after dosing and across the work shift; percentages of patients returning to normal work performance within 2 hours after dosing and across the work shift; percentages of patients experiencing headache relief (reduction of moderate or severe predose pain to mild or no pain) 1 and 2 hours after dosing. Mean productivity loss was significantly (P< or =.002) lower in the sumatriptan group compared with the placebo group both during the 2-hour postdose period (sumatriptan, 39 minutes; placebo, 54 minutes) and across the work shift (sumatriptan, 86 minutes; placebo, 168 minutes). Significantly (P<.001) greater percentages of patients in the sumatriptan group compared with the placebo group returned to normal work performance by 2 hours after dosing (sumatriptan, 52%; placebo, 9%) and across the work shift (sumatriptan, 66%; placebo, 18%). Significantly (P< or =.001) greater percentages of patients in the sumatriptan group compared with the placebo group experienced headache relief 1 hour after dosing (sumatriptan, 69%; placebo, 18%) and 2 hours after dosing (sumatriptan, 79%; placebo, 32%). Sumatriptan reduced migraine-associated productivity loss during a minimum 8-hour work shift by approximately 50% compared with placebo and alleviated headache in more than three fourths of patients.

Abstract 440 of 500

Sixty-six patients with ingrowing toenails were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups and followed up for 16 to 30 months after surgery. In group A 39 nail edges in 32 patients were treated by excision of the nail edge and chemical ablation of germinal matrix edge with 70% aqueous phenol. There were 34 patients in group B, in whom 46 nail edges and germinal matrix edges were surgically excised. In group A recurring symptoms developed in four (10%) nail edges, necessitating further surgery, and asymptomatic spicules developed in seven (18%) nail edges. Two (4%) nails in group B required reoperation and spicules developed in 10 (22%). Both procedures were performed as outpatient surgery, relieved pain and infection, and were acceptable to patients. At an average 2-year follow-up, both procedures yielded comparable results that were superior to those of simple avulsion.

Abstract 441 of 500

In a randomized study, uterine activity patterns were characterized with a portable pressure-sensitive device in 40 nonlaboring women at term with an unfavorable cervix who were undergoing preinduction cervical ripening with prostaglandin E2. The prostaglandin E2 was inserted into the posterior vaginal fornix as a single dose of either a 2.5 mg methylcellulose gel (20 cases) or 10 mg controlled-release pessary (20 cases). Uterine activity monitoring began 1 hour before dosing and continued for 12 hours. For those treated with the gel, low-amplitude, high-frequency contractions began within the first hour, reached a peak within 4 hours, and initiated sustained high-amplitude contractions in 10 (50%) cases. With the controlled-release pessary, low-amplitude, high-frequency contractions had a slightly later onset, reached a peak between the fifth and eighth hours, and initiated sustained high-amplitude contractions in 18 (80%) cases. Uterine hyperstimulation occurred in two (10%) pessary cases, with no adverse effect after removal. We conclude that low-amplitude, high-frequency uterine contractions began with either method of intravaginal prostaglandin E2 delivery but led to sustained, high-amplitude contractions primarily with the pessary.

Abstract 442 of 500

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible influence of 2 different methods of treatment (antithyroid drugs and antithyroid drugs plus levothyroxine) on the number of recurrences in Graves' disease, as well as to study the possible prognostic factors for the evolution of the disease. Seventy-six patients allocated in to 2 treatment groups were studied. Group A included those patients treated with decreasing doses of carbimazole and group B included patients treated with high doses of carbimazole plus levothyroxine. The follow-up of these patients was carried out over a minimum of 36 months after discontinuation of treatment. No significant differences were observed in either the clinical characteristics or hormonal or antibody values in both groups on initiation and at the end of treatment. The percentage of recurrence in group A patients during the first 12 months of follow-up was significantly greater (65% vs 23%, p < 0.001) than in group B. The percentage of recurrence equalled (62.8% vs 60.7%, p = NS) on prolongation of follow-up of up to 36 months. Recurrence was not correlated with either the clinical or biochemical parameters evaluated, although it did correlate with goiter size with recurrence observed in 100% of the patients with goiter greater than or equal to II. The association of levothyroxine to treatment with carbimazole in Graves' disease delays the appearance of recurrence but does not significantly decrease it in comparison with the treatment with carbimazole in decreasing doses. Only the size of goiter on initiation of treatment may be a prognostic factor for disease evolution.

Abstract 443 of 500

Reducing the dietary glycemic load and the glycemic index was proposed as a novel approach to weight reduction. A parallel-design, randomized 12-wk controlled feeding trial with a 24-wk follow-up phase was conducted to test the hypothesis that a hypocaloric diet designed to reduce the glycemic load and the glycemic index would result in greater sustained weight loss than other hypocaloric diets. Obese subjects (n = 29) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 diets providing 3138 kJ less than estimated energy needs: high glycemic index (HGI), low glycemic index (LGI), or high fat (HF). For the first 12 wk, all food was provided to subjects (feeding phase). Subjects (n = 22) were instructed to follow the assigned diet for 24 additional weeks (free-living phase). Total body weight was obtained and body composition was assessed by skinfold measurements. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the homeostasis model (HOMA). At 12 wk, weight changes from baseline were significant in all groups but not different among groups (-9.3 +/- 1.3 kg for the HGI diet, -9.9 +/- 1.4 kg for the LGI diet, and -8.4 +/- 1.5 kg for the HF diet). All groups improved in insulin sensitivity at the end of the feeding phase of the study. During the free-living phase, all groups maintained their initial weight loss and their improved insulin sensitivity. Weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity scores were independent of diet composition. In summary, lowering the glycemic load and glycemic index of weight reduction diets does not provide any added benefit to energy restriction in promoting weight loss in obese subjects.

Abstract 444 of 500

This randomised, double-blind study compared single dose lumiracoxib (a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor) 100 and 400 mg, ibuprofen 400 mg and placebo in patients with postoperative dental pain over 12 h. The primary efficacy variable was pain intensity difference. Lumiracoxib 400 mg and ibuprofen were superior to placebo from 1 to 12 h post dose while lumiracoxib 100 mg was superior from 1.5 to 9 h. Lumiracoxib 400 mg demonstrated the fastest median time to onset of analgesia (37.4 min) followed by ibuprofen (41.5), and lumiracoxib 100 mg (52.4; all p < or = 0.001 vs. placebo). Median time to rescue medication (h) was longer for lumiracoxib 400 mg (> or = 12), lumiracoxib 100 mg (approximately 7) and ibuprofen (approximately 8) than placebo (approximately 2; all p < or = 0.001 vs. placebo). Patients rated lumiracoxib 400 mg superior to the other active treatments (p < 0.05); lumiracoxib 100 mg was comparable with ibuprofen and superior to placebo (p < 0.001). Lumiracoxib provided rapid, effective and well-tolerated analgesia.

Abstract 445 of 500

To determine whether buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine and other symptomatic medications in managing ambulatory heroin withdrawal. Open label, prospective randomized controlled trial examining withdrawal and 4-week postwithdrawal outcomes on intention-to-treat. Two specialist, out-patient drug treatment centres in inner city Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. One hundred and fourteen dependent heroin users were recruited. Participants were 18 years or over, and with no significant other drug dependence, medical or psychiatric conditions or recent methadone treatment. One hundred and one (89%) participants completed a day 8 research interview examining withdrawal outcomes, and 92 (81%) completed day 35 research interview examining postwithdrawal outcomes. Participants randomized to control (n = 56) (up to 8 days of clonidine and other symptomatic medications) or experimental (n = 58) (up to 5 days of buprenorphine) withdrawal groups. Following the 8-day withdrawal episode, participants could self-select from range of postwithdrawal options (naltrexone, substitution maintenance, or counselling). Retention in withdrawal; heroin use during withdrawal; and retention in drug treatment 4 weeks after withdrawal. Withdrawal severity; adverse events, and heroin use in the postwithdrawal period. The experimental group had better treatment retention at day 8 (86% versus 57%, P = 0.001, 95% CI for numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 3-8) and day 35 (62% versus 39%, P = 0.02, 95% CI for NNT = 4-18); used heroin on fewer days during the withdrawal programme (2.6 +/- 2.5 versus 4.5 +/- 2.3, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1-2.5 days) and in the postwithdrawal period (9.0 +/- 8.2 versus 14.6 +/- 10, P < 0.01, 95% CI = 1.8-9.4); and reported less withdrawal severity. No severe adverse events reported. Buprenorphine is effective for short-term ambulatory heroin withdrawal, with greater retention, less heroin use and less withdrawal discomfort during withdrawal; and increased postwithdrawal treatment retention than symptomatic medications.

Abstract 446 of 500

This study was designed to determine the effect of clofibrate on neonatal uncomplicated jaundice treated with home phototherapy. This clinical trial study was performed on 60 newborns with jaundice that received home phototherapy. Inclusion criteria were body weight between 2500 to 4000 gr, breastfed, total serum bilirubin (TSB) between 14 to 20 mg/dl, aged over 72 hours. The neonates were randomly divided into two groups. All received home phototherapy. Group I received a single dose of 50 mg/kg clofibrate and the other group served as control group. Total serum bilirubin level was measured every 24 hours. Two groups were matched regarding weight, sex, age and first TSB. At 24 and 48 hours of treatment, the mean values of TSB in the clofibrate group were 13.72 (1.56), 9.5 (0.56) and in the control group 15.30 (1.44), 12.6 (1.44). The results show that TSB was significantly decreased after 24 and 48 hours in clofibrate group (P<0.001). The mean duration of phototherapy in group I was 72(0.0) hours and in the control group 76.80 (±9.76) hours. The duration of phototherapy was significantly shorter in clofibrate group (P<0.001). Clofibrate is effective for outpatients with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia who are under home phototherapy. Of course, further studies are needed for approved routine use of this drug in the treatment of neonatal jaundice.

Abstract 447 of 500

A study was carried out to compare 3 treatment regimens for vaginal candidiasis. A total of 150 women with clinical and mycological evidence of vaginal candidiasis were randomized to receive 50 mg of oral fluconazole daily for 6 days (50 women), a single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole (50 women), or 100 mg of intravaginal clotrimazole daily for 6 days (50 women). They were assessed at 5-15 days (short-term assessment) and again at 30-60 days (long-term assessment) after the completion of treatment. Candida species were completely eradicated from the vagina in 88% or 80% in the 6-day oral fluconzaole group, 76% or 70% in the single oral fluconazole group, and 72% or 60% in the intravaginal clotrimazole group at short-term or long-term assessment, respectively. The rates of clinical effectiveness were 92% or 88% in the 6-day oral fluconzaole group, 80% or 76% in the single oral fluconazole group, and 72% or 58% in the intravaginal clotrimazole group at the short-term or long-term assessment, respectively. Treatment-related side effects were not found in any group. This study suggests that the treatment of vaginal candidiasis with oral fluconazole is effective and that a single oral fluconazole dose might be one choice in the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.

Abstract 449 of 500

The application of crushed ice or hydrogenated silicate, a micro-crystalline substitute has been used as a method to treat posttraumatic and postoperative irritations of the locomotor system for a long time. Closed systems using pumps can be viewed as further development as they enable continuous, water-free cooling of operating areas. The analgetic effect of postoperative cold therapy was evaluated in a prospective clinical trial, including 312 patients after total knee or hip arthroplasty. Conventional cold packs, consisting of microcrystalline silicate were compared to a continuous applicable closed system. Continuous cryotherapy resulted in a depression of skin temperature to 12 degrees C, whereas intermittent cooling only caused a mean temperature decrease of 1 degree C. Clinically continuous cold application leads to a more than 50% decrease of analgetic demands in both, systemic and regional application (p < 0.001). This observation was found in a significant correlation with patient's pain sensation as well as primary range of motion. Intermittent cryotherapy was found to be ineffective in postoperative pain relieve in hip- and adequate in knee arthroplasty patients. We could not report an influence on postoperative blood loss, as discussed in previous reports.

Abstract 450 of 500

We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of a combination of desmopressin and oxybutynin for treating children with nocturnal enuresis, compared to the single drugs imipramine and desmopressin. We enrolled 158 patients from 2003 to 2004. Children were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups and treated with desmopressin, imipramine or a combination of desmopressin plus oxybutynin. Of these patients 145 (100 boys and 45 girls, mean age 7.8 +/- 2.5 years, range 5 to 15) were followed for more than 6 months. Efficacy was measured at 1, 3 and 6 months in terms of average enuretic frequency, 5-scale response based on change in nocturnal enuretic frequency after treatment and posttreatment enuretic frequency as a percentage of pretreatment baseline frequency. The latter efficacy was classified according to daytime voiding symptoms. Statistical evaluation was performed using chi-square tests and ANOVA. Of the 145 children followed 48 received combination therapy, 49 received desmopressin and 48 received imipramine. A total of 68 patients (47%) had monosymptomatic enuresis and 77 (53%) had polysymptomatic enuresis. Combination therapy produced the best and most rapid results regardless of whether the children had monosymptomatic or polysymptomatic enuresis. Combination therapy with desmopressin plus oxybutynin for the treatment of pediatric nocturnal enuresis was well tolerated, and gave significantly faster and more cost-effective results than single drug therapy using either desmopressin or imipramine.

Abstract 451 of 500

The Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between nimodipine-induced reduction in blood pressure (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in acute stroke. We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) nimodipine (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) nimodipine (n=94). The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048). Patients with a DBP reduction of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or dependency (Barthel Index <60) (n/N=25/26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1.02 to 101.74) and death alone (n/N=9/26, OR 4.336, 95% CI 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n/N=62/92 and 14/92, respectively). There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome. DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose nimodipine after acute stroke. For low-dose nimodipine, the results were not conclusive. These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine.

Abstract 452 of 500

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in combination with metoclopramide has been frequently used in clinical trials in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. Recently the efficacy of a new high buffered formulation of 1000 mg effervescent ASA without metoclopramide compared to placebo has been shown. To further confirm the efficacy of this new formulation in comparison with a triptan and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen) a three-fold crossover, double-blind, randomized trial with 312 patients was conducted in Germany, Italy and Spain. Effervescent ASA (1000 mg) was compared to encapsulated sumatriptan (50 mg), ibuprofen (400 mg) and placebo. The percentage of patients with reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe to mild or no pain (primary endpoint) was 52.5% for ASA, 60.2% for ibuprofen, 55.8% for sumatriptan and 30.6% for placebo. All active treatments were superior to placebo (P < 0.0001), whereas active treatments were not statistically different. The number of patients who were pain-free at 2 h was 27.1%, 33.2%, 37.1% and 12.6% for those treated with ASA, ibuprofen, sumatriptan or placebo, respectively. The difference between ASA and sumatriptan was statistically significant (P = 0.025). With respect to other secondary efficacy criteria and accompanying symptoms no statistically significant differences between ASA and ibuprofen or sumatriptan were found. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 4.1%, 5.7%, 6.6% and 4.5% of patients treated with ASA, ibuprofen sumatriptan or placebo. This study showed that 1000 mg effervescent ASA is as effective as 50 mg sumatriptan and 400 mg ibuprofen in the treatment of migraine attacks regarding headache relief from moderate/severe to mild/no pain at 2 h. Regarding pain-free at 2 h sumatriptan was most effective.

Abstract 453 of 500

We previously observed that short-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was greater with active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) than with standard CPR. In the current study, we assessed the effects of the active compression-decompression method on one-year survival. Patients who had cardiac arrest in the Paris metropolitan area or in Thionville, France, more than 80 percent of whom had asystole, were assigned to receive either standard CPR (377 patients) or active compression-decompression CPR (373 patients) according to whether their arrest occurred on an even or odd day of the month, respectively. The primary end point was survival at one year. The rate of survival to hospital discharge without neurologic impairment and the neurologic outcome were secondary end points. Both the rate of hospital discharge without neurologic impairment (6 percent vs. 2 percent, P=0.01) and the one-year survival rate (5 percent vs. 2 percent, P=0.03) were significantly higher among patients who received active compression-decompression CPR than among those who received standard CPR. All patients who survived to one year had cardiac arrests that were witnessed. Nine of 17 one-year survivors in the active compression-decompression group and 2 of 7 in the standard group, respectively, initially had asystole or pulseless electrical activity. In 12 of the 17 survivors who had received active compression-decompression CPR, neurologic status returned to base line, as compared with 3 of 7 survivors who had received standard CPR (P=0.34). Active compression-decompression CPR performed during advanced life support significantly improved long-term survival rates among patients who had cardiac arrest outside the hospital.

Abstract 454 of 500

A total of 79 Japanese women who were within 5 years of menopause were randomly assigned 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 [1alpha(OH)D3] 1.0 microg/day, conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg/day, a combination of both, or control (no treatment). Lumbar spine and proximal femur bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical indices were monitored over 2 years. In the 1alpha(OH)D3-treated group, there was a nonsignificant decrease in lumbar spine BMD compared with controls, and no significant loss in the femoral neck compared with controls. In the estrogen-treated group, there was a nonsignificant increase in spine BMD (+2.17% in the first year and +1.71% in the second year), and no loss in femoral neck BMD. The combination of conjugated estrogens +1alpha(OH)D3 was more effective in increasing BMD in the spine (+3. 68% in the first year and +3.63% in the second year) and femur (+2. 56% in the first year and +4.44% in the second year) BMD. There was a significant difference in lumbar spine BMD in both the first and second years between the combination-treated group and the 1alpha(OH)D3-treated and control groups (P < 0.01). Serum osteocalcin (OC) significantly decreased in the combination-treated group (-23.8% in the first year) and the estrogen-treated group (-37. 6% and -41.2% at 6 and 18 months, respectively), and serum alkaline phosphatase (Alp) decreased significantly in the first year in the combination-treated (-31.5%), estrogen-treated (-27.3%), and 1alpha(OH)D3-treated (-7.9%) groups, whereas serum OC increased (+45. 4% in the first year) in women without treatment. The results of this study indicate that early postmenopausal bone loss in the femoral neck is prevented by conjugated estrogens, 1alpha(OH)D3, or both, whereas bone loss in the spine is not prevented by 1alpha(OH)D3. Estrogen proves effective in preventing early postmenopausal bone loss by markedly inhibiting bone turnover. Moreover, a synergistic bone-sparing effect can be expected when estrogen is administered concomitantly with 1alpha(OH)D3 rather than when used alone.

Abstract 455 of 500

The treatment of viral warts remains challenging. A variety of treatment modalities have been used with a range of success. Fluorouracil has been shown to be effective in treating warts but the method of its delivery directly onto the affected tissue has been of little efficacy. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of intralesional 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of verrucae. Seventy-six patients with a total 315 verrucae were randomized to receive either a 5-fluorouracil, lidocaine and epinephrine (5-FU + LE) mixture or serum saline injection into the paired verrucae in the same patient. The mixture of 5-FU (4 cm(3), 50 mg/mL), lidocaine (1 cm(3), 20 mg/mL) and epinephrine (0.0125 mg/mL) was injected into the base of the wart using a mantoux needle. Each lesion was infiltrated with either of the solutions once a week for up to a maximum of 4 weeks, and the patients were followed up for 6 months. Complete response was noted in an average of 70% of the verrucae treated with the 5-FU + LE mixture and in 29% of those in the placebo group (P < 0.001). No clinically significant systemic and local adverse effects occurred. Pain and burning were noted as an immediate injection pain. Recurrence rates were evaluated and no statistically significant difference between the two groups was found. The results demonstrate that treatment of verrucae with 5-FU + LE mixture is safe and effective.

Abstract 456 of 500

To compare menstrual patterns and side effects between transdermal contraceptive patch and oral contraceptive use in Thai women over 35 years old. Open labeled randomized control trial. Family Planning Clinic, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. Ninety-six women above the age of 35 years old were randomized to receive either transdermal contraceptive patch (n = 48) or oral contraceptive (n = 48). The patch regimen was three consecutive 7-day patches (21 days) followed by 1 patch-free week per cycle; the oral contraceptive contained with ethinyl estradiol (EE) 30 microg and levonorgestrel 150 microg. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of cycle length. The mean duration in the transdermal contraceptive group was longer than the COC group with statistically significant difference. More patients in the COC group experienced spotting than the transdermal contraceptive group. Neither amenorrhea nor pregnancies occurred in both groups. Transdermal contraceptive patch provides reliable contraceptive efficacy. It also provides good cycle control equal to COC in Thai women aged above 35 years old. However, a higher incidence of minor adverse effects such as breast tenderness and nausea were demonstrated when compared to oral contraceptive containing with ethinyl estradiol (EE) 30 microg and levonorgestrel 150 microg.

Abstract 457 of 500

In the Sahel and sub-Sahelian regions of Africa, malaria transmission is highly seasonal. During a short period of high malaria transmission, mortality and morbidity are high in children under age 5 years. We assessed the efficacy of seasonal intermittent preventive treatment-a full dose of antimalarial treatment given at defined times without previous testing for malaria infection. We did a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of the effect of intermittent preventive treatment on morbidity from malaria in three health-care centres in Niakhar, a rural area of Senegal. 1136 children aged 2-59 months received either one dose of artesunate plus one dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or two placebos on three occasions during the malaria transmission season. The primary outcome was a first or single episode of clinical malaria detected through active or passive case detection. Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with , number NCT00132561. During 13 weeks of follow-up, the intervention led to an 86% (95% CI 80-90) reduction in the occurrence of clinical episodes of malaria. With passive case detection, protective efficacy against malaria was 86% (77-92), and when detected actively was 86% (78-91). The incidence of malaria in children on active drugs was 308 episodes per 1000 person-years at risk, whereas in those on placebo it was 2250 episodes per 1000 person-years at risk. 13 children were not included in the intention-to-treat analysis, which was restricted to children who received a first dose of antimalarial or placebo. There was an increase in vomiting in children who received the active drugs, but generally the intervention was well tolerated. Intermittent preventive treatment could be highly effective for prevention of malaria in children under 5 years of age living in areas of seasonal malaria infection.

Abstract 458 of 500

Glucosamine sulfate is able to stimulate proteoglycan synthesis by chondrocytes and has mild anti-inflammatory properties. In clinical trials, glucosamine sulfate was more effective than placebo in controlling the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA). In order to better characterize this therapeutic activity, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of glucosamine sulfate 500 mg t.i.d. vs ibuprofen 400 mg t.i.d., orally for 4 weeks. The study included 200 hospitalized patients with active OA of the knee, symptoms for at least 3 months and a Lequesne's index of at least 7 points. Patients were evaluated weekly. Response was defined as a reduction in the Lequesne's index by at least 2 points if the enrollment value was higher than 12 points, or by at least 1 point if the enrollment value was 12 or less points, together with a positive overall assessment by the investigator. The improvement tended to be sooner under ibuprofen (48% responders vs 28% after the 1st treatment week; P = 0.06, Fisher's Exact test), but there was no difference from the 2nd week onward, with a success rate of 52% in the ibuprofen group and of 48% in the glucosamine group (P = 0.67) at the end of treatment. The average Lequesne's index at enrollment was around 16 points and decreased by over 6 points in both groups, again with the above described trend. On the other hand, 35% of patients on ibuprofen reported adverse events, mainly of gastrointestinal origin, vs 6% adverse events with glucosamine (P < 0.001, Fisher's Exact test). The number of adverse event related drop-outs was different between the two groups (7% vs 1%, respectively; P = 0.035). Glucosamine sulfate was therefore as effective as ibuprofen on symptoms of knee OA. These data confirm glucosamine sulfate as a safe symptomatic Slow Acting Drug for OA.

Abstract 459 of 500

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has any effect on the development of liver decompensation and on survival of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). A total of 86 patients with compensated PBC were randomly assigned to receive UDCA (n = 43) or to remain untreated (controls, n = 43). There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Mean follow-up was 7.3 +/- 3.0 yr in the UDCA and 8.1 +/- 3.1 yr in the control group. Fourteen control patients were crossed-over to UDCA therapy after a median of 3.5 yr (range 2-8 yr), at their own request. Liver decompensation developed in 41 patients (22 in the UDCA and 19 in the control group) and liver death or transplantation in 33 (19 in the UDCA and 14 in the control group) patients. There was no significant difference in the probability of development of liver decompensation, liver death, or transplantation (by log-rank test) between UDCA-treated and control patients, whether by an intention-to-treat or by treatment-as-received analysis. UDCA was not found to have any demonstrable effect on the long-term outcome of PBC and did not improve the survival of PBC patients.

Abstract 460 of 500

The risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery is not well known. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of DVT, to demonstrate the efficacy of a perioperative and postoperative prophylaxis against thromboembolism with use of low--molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and to show the safety and feasibility of LMWH administration. Prospective, single-blind, randomized clinical trial. There were 218 consecutive outpatients scheduled for ambulatory arthroscopic knee surgery eligible. Of these, 130 patients were randomized to a treatment group with LMWH (dalteparin: 2,500 IU less-than-or-equal70 kg and 5,000 IU >70 kg, started perioperatively and given once daily for 4 weeks; n = 66) and a control group (n = 64) with no prophylaxis. To detect DVT, all patients underwent bilateral compression ultrasonography before and 12 and 31 days after surgery. Among the 130 patients studied, thromboembolism was significantly lower in the treatment than in the control group: 1 of 66 (1.5%) versus 10 of 64 (15.6%); 95% confidence interval, 7.8% to 26.8%; P =.004. Eighty percent of DVT occurred within the first 14 postoperative days. No severe side effects of LMWH were observed. Only 5% of patients refused continued subcutaneous LMWH injections. In patients undergoing ambulatory arthroscopic knee surgery without antithrombotic prophylaxis, the risk of DVT is high. Perioperative and postoperative prophylaxis with dalteparin is an effective and safe means of reducing this risk.

Abstract 461 of 500

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease with no cure. In a transgenic mouse model of ALS, creatine monohydrate showed a promising increase in survival. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential clinical trial to assess the effect of creatine monohydrate on survival and disease progression in patients with ALS. Between June 2000 and December 2001, 175 patients with probable, probable-laboratory supported, or definite ALS were randomly assigned to receive either creatine monohydrate or placebo 10 gm daily. A sequential trial design was used with death, persistent assisted ventilation, or tracheostomy as primary end points. Secondary outcome measurements were rate of decline of isometric arm muscle strength, forced vital capacity, functional status, and quality of life. The trial was stopped when the null hypothesis of indifference was accepted. Creatine did not affect survival (cumulative survival probability of 0.70 in the creatine group vs 0.68 in the placebo group at 12 months, and 0.52 in the creatine group vs 0.47 in the placebo group at 16 months), or the rate of decline of functional measurements. Creatine intake did not cause important adverse reactions. This placebo-controlled trial did not find evidence of a beneficial effect of creatine monohydrate on survival or disease progression in patients with ALS.

Abstract 462 of 500

Paraquat is a bipyridil herbicide and in appropriate and careful usage, will not be health threatening. Most adult cases of intoxication are due to suicidal attempts rather than accidental exposure. Therapeutic response has been reported to be appropriate with high doses of cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids and survival is reported to be approximately 75%. So, this study was designed to evaluate the effects of combined treatment with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids in patients with paraquat poisoning. During a two-year period 45 patients with paraquat poisoning were admitted to Sina Hospital, Hamadan, Iran, of whom 20 had moderate to severe intoxication. Eleven patients (group 1) received conventional treatment and nine patients (group 2) received conventional treatment plus intravenous infusions of cyclophosphamide 15 mg/kg daily for two days, methylprednisolone one gram daily for three days, and mesna 15 mg/kg for four days. The mean age+/-SD in group 1 was 25+/-10 years and in group 2 was 26+/-10 years. In group 1 three patients were females and eight patients were males. In group 2 one patient was female and eight patients were males. There were no differences between the groups in the time elapsed from ingestion to presentation at hospital or in the beginning of hemodialysis. The mortality rate in group 1 was 81.8% and in group 2 was 33.3% (P< 0.05). All fatalities caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone may be effective in preventing respiratory failure and reducing mortality in patients with moderate to severe paraquat poisoning.

Abstract 463 of 500

To compare the efficacy and safety of amisulpride and olanzapine in subjects with schizophrenia and comorbid depression in a randomised double-blind trial. Eighty-five adult patients fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and presenting a depressive episode were randomised to amisulpride (200-600 mg/day) or olanzapine (5-15 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Primary efficacy variables were change in Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) score and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of Change. Safety was monitored by adverse event reporting and determination of extrapyramidal function and metabolic variables. The mean change from baseline of CDS score was -6.84 in the amisulpride group and -7.36 in the olanzapine group. 65.9% and 61.5% of subjects, respectively, were considered "much" or "very much" improved. No significant inter-group difference in effect size was observed. The frequency of adverse events was low and emergence of extrapyramidal symptoms was not seen. Four patients in the olanzapine group developed abnormal triglyceride levels. Mean weight gain was 1.45 and 0.5 kg, respectively, in the olanzapine and amisulpride groups. Amisulpride and olanzapine are effective in patients with schizophrenia and comorbid depression. Tolerance of both drugs was acceptable, although use of olanzapine was associated with a trend toward greater metabolic side-effects .

Abstract 464 of 500

Maternal cardiovascular changes and neonatal acid-base status were assessed in 29 healthy women undergoing elective lower segment Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. The patients were allocated randomly to one of three groups to receive an i.v. infusion of one of the following: ephedrine 1 mg min-1 (group E1: n = 10), ephedrine 2 mg min-1 (group E2: n = 9), or phenylephrine 10 micrograms min-1 (group P: n = 10). Invasive arterial pressure was monitored continuously and if hypotension occurred (defined as a 20% decrease from baseline, taken after i.v. preload administration), bolus doses of either ephedrine (6 mg in groups E1 and E2) or phenylephrine (20 micrograms in group P) were given. Only four patients became hypotensive in group E2, compared with eight patients in group E1 and nine patients in group P. The total time that the patients remained hypotensive was greatest in group P (P < 0.005), less in group E1 and least in group E2. Neonatal Apgar scores and acid-base profiles were similar in all three groups. In this study, an infusion of phenylephrine 10 micrograms min-1 with bolus doses of 20 micrograms was shown to be significantly less effective in maintaining systolic arterial pressure within 20% limits of baseline compared with an infusion of ephedrine 1 or 2 mg min-1 with bolus doses of 6 mg.

Abstract 465 of 500

To evaluate the efficacy of tamsulosin compared to placebo for treating catheterized patients with acute urinary retention (AUR) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), by comparing the numbers of patients who voided successfully after removing their catheter. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study. Men with AUR secondary to BPH were catheterized and then, if they fulfilled the entry criteria, were randomly assigned to receive either 0.4 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride in a modified-release capsule once daily, or a placebo. After up to eight doses the catheter was removed and the ability to void unaided assessed. In all, 149 men (mean age 69.4 years) were randomly assigned to receive tamsulosin (75) or placebo (74); eight were not evaluable, so the intent-to-treat population was 141 men. Thirty-four men taking tamsulosin and 18 taking placebo did not require re-catheterization on the day of the trial without catheter (48% and 26% respectively, P = 0.011; odds ratio 2.47, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.23-4.97). Success using free-flow variables was also higher in the men who received tamsulosin, at 37 (52%) vs 24 (34%) on placebo (P = 0.019; odds ratio 2.34, 95% CI 1.15-4.75). Withdrawals were high (120 men, 81%), mostly because of a need for re-catheterization (89 men, 60%). Dizziness and somnolence occurred in seven (10%) and four (6%) men who received tamsulosin, and two (3%) who received placebo, but overall the incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. One patient died from carcinomatosis. Men catheterized for AUR can void more successfully after catheter removal if treated with tamsulosin, and are less likely to need re-catheterization. The side-effect profile was similar for tamsulosin and placebo, and consistent with known pharmacology. From these results tamsulosin can be recommended for treating men after catheterization for AUR, and can reduce the likelihood of the need for re-catheterization.

Abstract 466 of 500

In a previous study on the effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) in combination with a paracervical block (PCB) as an analgesic method during oocyte aspiration in IVF treatment, EA appeared to increase the pregnancy rate. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that EA as an analgesic during oocyte aspiration would result in: (i) a better IVF pregnancy rate than with alfentanil; (ii) peroperative analgesia that was as good as that produced by alfentanil; (iii) less postoperative abdominal pain, nausea and stress; and (iv) a reduction in the use of additional analgesics. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) concentrations in follicular fluid (FF) were analysed when possible. In this prospective, randomized, multicentre clinical trial, 286 women undergoing oocyte aspiration were randomly allocated to the EA group (EA plus a PCB) or to the alfentanil group (alfentanil plus a PCB). No significant differences were found between the EA and alfentanil groups in any of the IVF variables. NPY concentrations in FF were significantly higher in the EA group compared with the alfentanil group. No correlation between pregnancy rate and NPY concentrations was found in either analgesic group. Both EA plus a PCB and alfentanil plus a PCB induced adequate peroperative analgesia during oocyte aspiration evaluated using the visual analogue scale. After 2 h, the EA group reported significantly less abdominal pain, other pain, nausea and stress than the alfentanil group. In addition, the EA group received significantly lower amounts of additional alfentanil than the alfentanil group. EA does not improve pregnancy rate in the present clinical situation. The observation that NPY concentrations in FF were higher in the EA group may be important for human ovarian steroidogenesis. The analgesic effects produced by EA are as good as those produced by conventional analgesics, and the use of opiate analgesics with EA is lower than when conventional analgesics alone are used.

Abstract 467 of 500

Infants born preterm are at high risk for poor growth achievement. Small for gestational age (SGA (birth weight below the 10th percentile) preterm infants are even more prone to develop postnatal growth retardation in the early neonatal period, as they do not have a large storage of protein/energy. Both SGA and appropriate for gestational age (AGA: birth weight between the 10th and 90th percentiles) infants show persistent postnatal growth failure after discharge. Although the available data clearly demonstrate that preterm infants, especially if born SGA, exhibit postnatal growth retardation at the time of hospital discharge, the importance of the nutritional post discharge management has not been sufficiently taken into account. We have recently conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess whether infants born SGA may benefit from an enriched post discharge formula. This study suggests that the growth pattern in SGA preterm infants is not affected by the consumption of an enriched post discharge formula. The ponderal and linear growth of these infants does not accelerate to achieve early catch up growth. However, as far as the quality of growth is concerned, the fat mass accretion after term decelerates, so that an increase of fat free mass accretion takes place. Future research effort should be directed toward longer follow up and personalized nutrition management.

Abstract 468 of 500

8 general practitioners and 7 specialists in the field of psychiatry and neurology participated in this study evaluating the results of fluoxetine treatment in outpatients with depression in respect to safety and efficacy. They were familiarized with the requisite instruments by video rater training. The study was designed as a randomised double-blind parallel study involving 139 patients, comparing the effects of a daily dosage of 20 mg fluoxetine, 40 mg fluoxetine and 50 mg clomipramine. The number of patients treated in each group was 45, 46, and 48, respectively and altogether 125 completed the four-week study (five visits). A comparison of overall efficacy ratings showed significant antidepressant efficacy in all three treatment groups. On day 14 of the study (visit 4), patients receiving 40 mg fluoxetine showed significantly (p less than 0.05) better global improvement than patients receiving clomipramine. Treatment was well tolerated by all patients. The frequency of adverse events in response to fluoxetine was lower than under clomipramine treatment. On comparing treatment by psychiatrist and general practitioner no significant differences were found regarding age, sex, number of previous episodes and duration of the recent episode and outcome. Severe depression tended to be treated by psychiatrists; general practitioners prescribed additional medication less frequently.

Abstract 469 of 500

Resistance exercise and creatine supplementation independently improve strength and function in patients with certain neuromuscular diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of resistance training with and without creatine supplementation on muscle, strength, and function in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Twenty patients with CMT consumed 5 g/day creatine or placebo while participating in resistance training for 12 weeks. Energy metabolites, muscle fiber type and size, strength, and timed activities of daily living were measured before and after training. There were no differences between creatine or placebo groups for any outcome. For the groups combined, exercise training increased type I muscle fiber diameter (48.2 +/- 14.2 microm vs. 55.4 +/- 14.8 microm), strength, and activities of daily living (ADL) times. Thus, patients respond to resistance training with muscle fiber adaptations, and improvements in strength and function. Creatine was not beneficial. Copyright 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract 470 of 500

The optimal level of counseling and frequency of attendance for medication distribution has not been established for the primary care, office-based buprenorphine-naloxone treatment of opioid dependence. We conducted a 24-week randomized, controlled clinical trial with 166 patients assigned to one of three treatments: standard medical management and either once-weekly or thrice-weekly medication dispensing or enhanced medical management and thrice-weekly medication dispensing. Standard medical management was brief, manual-guided, medically focused counseling; enhanced management was similar, but each session was extended. The primary outcomes were the self-reported frequency of illicit opioid use, the percentage of opioid-negative urine specimens, and the maximum number of consecutive weeks of abstinence from illicit opioids. The three treatments had similar efficacies with respect to the mean percentage of opioid-negative urine specimens (standard medical management and once-weekly medication dispensing, 44 percent; standard medical management and thrice-weekly medication dispensing, 40 percent; and enhanced medical management and thrice-weekly medication dispensing, 40 percent; P=0.82) and the maximum number of consecutive weeks during which patients were abstinent from illicit opioids. All three treatments were associated with significant reductions from baseline in the frequency of illicit opioid use, but there were no significant differences among the treatments. The proportion of patients remaining in the study at 24 weeks did not differ significantly among the patients receiving standard medical management and once-weekly medication dispensing (48 percent) or thrice-weekly medication dispensing (43 percent) or enhanced medical management and thrice-weekly medication dispensing (39 percent) (P=0.64). Adherence to buprenorphine-naloxone treatment varied; increased adherence was associated with improved treatment outcomes. Among patients receiving buprenorphine-naloxone in primary care for opioid dependence, the efficacy of brief weekly counseling and once-weekly medication dispensing did not differ significantly from that of extended weekly counseling and thrice-weekly dispensing. Strategies to improve buprenorphine-naloxone adherence are needed. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00023283 [ClinicalTrials.gov].). Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society.

Abstract 471 of 500

Azimilide dihydrochloride (azimilide) is an investigational antiarrhythmic drug that has been tested in patients with a variety of arrhythmias. In patients with atrial fibrillation, it has shown excellent efficacy in some previous trials and minimal efficacy in others. Patients who had symptomatic atrial fibrillation for > 48 hours but < 6 months were eligible for this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients were admitted to a hospital and randomly assigned to receive either azimilide 125 mg or a matched placebo twice daily for 3 days and then once daily. Patients who were in sinus rhythm spontaneously or had sinus rhythm restored by electric cardioversion on day 4 were discharged from the hospital. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation was documented by electrocardiogram. In the primary efficacy analysis, time to recurrence in the 2 treatment groups was compared with the log-rank test in the subgroup of patients with structural heart disease. Safety was assessed as deaths, adverse events, and serious adverse events. A total of 446 patients were randomized in the study; 314 were in the subgroup with structural heart disease. The median time to arrhythmia recurrence in both treatment groups with structural heart disease was 13 days, and the difference between treatments was not significant (P = .4596, n = 314). The relative risk for recurrence (placebo:azimilide) was 1.104 (95% CI 0.849-1.436). There was 1 death in the placebo group and 3 in the azimilide group. Azimilide did not demonstrate clinically important or statistically significant efficacy in reducing the risk for arrhythmia recurrence in patients with structural heart disease who were in atrial fibrillation and converted to sinus rhythm.

Abstract 472 of 500

1,218 smokers able to quit smoking for 48 hr were randomly assigned to one of 12 cells in a 4 x 3 fully crossed factorial experiment. A pharmacologic factor contained four levels: nicotine polacrilex (gum) delivered ad lib or on a fixed regimen, placebo gum, and no gum. A self-guided behavioral treatment factor contained three levels: self-selected relapse prevention modules, randomly administered modules, and no modules. Those receiving nicotine gum were more likely to be abstinent at the 2- and 6-month follow-ups. The fixed regimen accounted for most of the effect for gum. There was no effect for the relapse prevention module factor. Men and women showed a differential treatment response. Men who received nicotine gum were more likely to be abstinent at each follow-up (2, 6, and 12 months). No treatment was significantly better among women. We conclude that research on different gum chewing regimens is warranted and that further examination of possible gender differences in response to replacement therapy is needed.

Abstract 473 of 500

A comparative study of long-term haemodialysis patients investigated the effects of calcium acetate and calcium carbonate on concentrations of serum phosphate, calcium, and parathyroid hormone. It was demonstrated that both substances led to a significant decrease in phosphate and serum parathyroid hormone. Administration of calcium acetate reduced the serum phosphate concentration in 7 weeks from an initial value of 2.08 +/- 0.53 mmol/l to 1.51 +/- 0.39 mmol/l (P less than 0.01). Following a 1-week wash-out period, calcium carbonate reduced the serum phosphate concentration in the same patients from 1.99 +/- 0.62 mmol/l to 1.34 +/- 0.40 mmol/l (P less than 0.01). Of particular significance, however, is the fact that in relation to daily elementary calcium intake, calcium acetate was a considerably more effective binder of intestinal phosphate than calcium carbonate. During administration of calcium acetate only 1.02 g of elementary calcium were required daily in order to reduce the serum phosphate concentration. The same patients, however, required 1.88 g of elementary calcium during calcium carbonate therapy. Complementary studies investigated the influence of an accompanying calcitriol medication. In this instance, too, calcium acetate was shown to be more effective; although the patients developed hypercalcaemia with calcium acetate, this happened more often with calcium carbonate. In summary it can be said that daily calcium loading of the uraemic organism under calcium acetate therapy is reduced by nearly half as compared to calcium carbonate therapy, and that this can be achieved with the same effective decrease of the serum phosphate concentration.

Abstract 474 of 500

Little is known on fracture risk in young women using oral contraceptives. Case-control study (64,548 cases, 193,641 controls). Overall, no major association with risk of fracture was present. Only in a few age groups a limited increase (OR 1.1-1.5) was seen in those using low average doses (less than one tablet per day - i.e., intermittent use). Neither 20 nor >or=30 mcg per day of ethinylestradiol was associated with risk of fractures, while changing from 20 to >or=30 mcg per day or vice versa was associated with a limited increase in fracture risk (OR 1.1-1.4) in some age groups. In general, use of oral contraceptives in young women did not seem to be associated with an increased risk of fractures. The isolated increase seen in some strata with low average doses may be linked to factors associated with discontinuation of oral contraceptives rather than pharmacological effects.

Abstract 475 of 500

To evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation on bone acquisition in adolescent white girls. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of 18 months of calcium supplementation on bone density and bone mass. Ninety-four girls with a mean age of 11.9 + 0.5 years at study entry. University hospital in a small town. Calcium supplementation, 500 mg/d calcium as calcium citrate malate; controls received placebo pills. Bone mineral density and bone mineral content of the lumbar spine and total body were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and calcium excretion from 24-hour urine specimens. Calcium intake from dietary sources averaged 960 mg/d for the entire study group. The supplemented group received, on average, an additional 354 mg/d of calcium. The supplemented group compared with the placebo group had greater increases of lumbar spine bone density (18.7% vs 15.8%; P = .03), lumbar spine bone mineral content (39.4% vs 34.7%; P = .06), total body bone mineral density (9.6% vs 8.3%; P = .05), and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion (90.4 vs 72.9 mg/d; P = .02), respectively. Increasing daily calcium intake from 80% of the recommended daily allowance to 110% via supplementation with calcium citrate malate resulted in significant increases in total body and spinal bone density in adolescent girls. The increase of 24 g of bone gain per year among the supplemented group translates to an additional 1.3% skeletal mass per year during adolescent growth, which may provide protection against future osteoporotic fracture.

Abstract 476 of 500

To examine the efficacy of mannitol in the prevention of lipid peroxidation during major liver resections performed during hepatic inflow occlusion. Prospective, randomized, open-label study. Aretaieion Hospital, a university-affiliated hospital. 30 ASA physical status II and III patients, less than 75 years of age, scheduled for elective liver resection. All patients received combined general and epidural anesthesia. Laparotomy was performed through a bilateral subcostal incision, and hepatectomy was performed by inflow vascular exclusion (Pringle's maneuver). Before this maneuver, and if the patients were hemodynamically stable, they were randomized to receive either mannitol 20% 1.5 mL kg(-1) (group M) or normal saline 1.5 mL kg(-1) (group S) intravenously for 30 minutes. Venous blood malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, as an index of lipid peroxidation, was measured spectrophotometrically at selected time points. Patients in both groups presented with raised MDA values (P < 0.05) for the period starting before the release of vascular occlusion until 6 days postoperatively. In patients receiving mannitol, lower MDA values were observed (P < 0.05) compared with group S at the end of operation. Mannitol has an antioxidant activity, but we were unable to confirm a positive impact on the postoperative clinical course.

Abstract 477 of 500

Montelukast, a specific cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, has been shown to improve pulmonary function within 1 h of ingestion. This study was undertaken to compare the effects on peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) of oral montelukast added to intravenous steroid, intravenous steroid alone and placebo during the 24 h period following administration. Seventy asthmatic patients (FEV1 40-80% predicted and > or = 15% improvement after inhaled beta agonist) were enrolled in a single blind study to receive oral montelukast (10 mg) plus intravenous prednisolone (1 mg/kg), intravenous prednisolone (1 mg/kg) or placebo in a randomised fashion. The patients received one ofthe above three groups of medication before any other treatments. This was immediately followed by the aerosol treatments of 100 mcg of terbutaline sulphate divided into three doses during 1 h as described in the consensus statement. Thereafter, patients were observed for 24 h to document the effects on PEFR, Borg dyspnoea score and need for rescue medication. The primary end point was percentage change at different time points. Secondary end points were Borg dyspnoea score and use of rescue medication. Compared with placebo, montelukast added to the prednisolone group and the prednisolone alone group had significant percentage change from baseline in PEFR in the entire 24 h period (P<0.05). The difference in PEFR between montelukast plus prednisolone group and prednisolone group favoured the montelukast plus prednisolone group but did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, montelukast plus prednisolone group required less inhaled short-acting beta agonistthan other two groups. The results of this study indicate that adding montelukast to steroid in acute asthma may have some additive improvement in lung functions.

Abstract 478 of 500

To compare a new triphasic oral contraceptive (OC) containing desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (DSG/EE) with triphasic norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol (NE/EE) regarding effects on clinical efficacy, cycle control, and safety indices. In an open-label, comparative multicenter study, 407 subjects were randomized to a triphasic preparation containing DSG/EE and 405 subjects to a triphasic preparation containing NE/EE. The women were observed during six cycles of OC use. The contraceptive efficacy of the triphasic DSG/EE OC was at least comparable to that of triphasic NE/EE. No pregnancies were reported with DSG/EE, whereas there were two pregnancies with NE/EE, both user failures. Cycle control with triphasic DSG/EE was statistically superior to that with triphasic NE/EE. Acceptability was excellent with both preparations as measured by the low discontinuation rates (particularly for adverse menstrual experiences). No thromboembolic or other serious drug-related adverse experiences were reported. The incidence of other drug-related adverse experiences was generally low and decreased with time in both groups. No adverse effects were seen in terms of blood pressure, body weight, laboratory indices, cervical cytology, and breast nodularity. Triphasic DSG/EE is an effective and safe OC with excellent acceptability and cycle control superior to that of triphasic NE/EE.

Abstract 479 of 500

Pharmacological penalisation of non-amblyopic eyes is an infrequently used alternative to occlusion for treating amblyopia. The authors compared the efficacy of atropine penalisation and that of occlusion as a primary treatment for amblyopia. Thirty six newly diagnosed patients with amblyopia were allocated to two groups for treatment. Eighteen patients in each group were treated either with atropine penalisation (group A) or occlusion therapy (group P). There was a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity in both groups treated. In group A improvement of the geometric mean visual acuity of the amblyopic eye was from 6/50 to 6/11 (p < 0.001). In group P improvement of the geometric mean visual acuity was from 6/60 to 6/19 (p < 0.001). In group A non-compliance with treatment was only 6% (2/18). Non-compliance in group P was 45% (8/18) at some stages of the treatment. Neither group produced an incidence of occlusion amblyopia. In this study atropine penalisation has been shown to be as effective as occlusion therapy in the treatment of amblyopia. Patient acceptance of atropine penalisation was superior to that for occlusion therapy as was shown by the compliance rate. Atropine treatment was also advantageous in that compliance could be readily checked by inspection.

Abstract 480 of 500

The effect of nifedipine (Adalat; Bayer-Miles)--a calcium channel blocker, which has a well-established place in nonobstetric hypertension--was compared with dihydralazine in 33 primigravidas with severe hypertension of pregnancy. Patients with a diastolic blood pressure greater than 110 mmHg before drug administration were randomly assigned to treatment with either nifedipine or dihydralazine. Both drugs were found to be equally efficacious. Nifedipine, however, showed an earlier onset of action in lowering systolic blood pressure and had the advantage of oral administration.

Abstract 481 of 500

In this multicentre study we evaluated the prevalence and risk factors of otitis media with effusion (OME) in Italian school-children and the effectiveness of medical treatment of chronic OME with a new cephalosporin, ceftibuten. During two winter periods, 3413 children, aged 5 to 7 years, were examined for the presence of OME by means of pneumotoscopy and a portable, hand-held tympanometer. The prevalence of asymptomatic OME was 14.2%, with no difference as regards sex, age, month of examination or geographic area. Younger children had significantly more bilateral than unilateral effusion. A recent episode of acute otitis media and previous tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy were associated with an increased risk of OME in multivariate logistic regression models. The presence of OME was unrelated to such factors as birthweight, prematurity, sibling or parental history of allergy, duration of daycare attendance, family history of ear infections. After 12 weeks, 26.6% of children with OME still had middle-ear fluid: 52 were randomized to ceftibuten (9 mg/kg q.d. for 14 days) and 59 to no treatment (nasal saline drops allowed). Children treated with ceftibuten had a significantly better resolution of middle-ear effusion after 4 and 8 weeks. As mass screening programmes for OME in the year of school entry are questioned, a focus only on children with known risk factors seems advisable. Ceftibuten can be useful in reducing the duration of middle-ear effusion.

Abstract 483 of 500

Our objective was to determine in a Cameroonian school population the effect of mild to moderate S. haematobium infection intensity on growth and development of children before and 6 months after praziquantel treatment. Previous studies have yielded contradictory results. Children from Bertoua schools were divided into four study groups: heavily infected (> 500 eggs 10 ml-1), moderately infected (1-499 eggs 10 ml-1) treated with praziquantel, a similar group treated with placebo, and an uninfected control group. Anthropometric measures--height for age per cent median (HAPM), and weight for age per cent median (WAPM)--were significantly higher among the uninfected children. Stepwise regression analysis showed that S. haematobium and Ascaris infections were the strongest predictors of the HAPM with hookworm and malaria infections playing a lesser role. Post treatment comparison of the praziquantel treatment group and the placebo group showed no significant differences for the anthropometric indicators except for mid-arm circumference. Longer observations of growth after treatment as well as monitoring of the rate of reinfection would be necessary to understand better the effect of S. haematobium on growth.

Abstract 484 of 500

Effects independent from cholesterol reduction on vascular function are considered to importantly contribute to the beneficial effects of statin therapy in cardiovascular disease. We aimed to evaluate the effect of high versus low dose atorvastatin on endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a setting of comparable cholesterol reduction. Fifty-eight patients with CAD were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment for 8 weeks with atorvastatin 80 mg per day (A80) or atorvastatin 10mg+ezetimibe 10mg per day (A10E10), respectively. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, nitroglycerin-mediated endothelium-independent vasodilation (NMD), lipid, C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma concentrations and urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha excretion were measured before and after treatment. Total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly reduced with no difference between A80 and A10E10. A80 caused significantly stronger improvement of FMD compared to A10E10 (absolute change FMD: A80+2.7+/-3.0% (post vs. pre p<0.001), A10E10+0.6+/-2.9% (post vs. pre p=0.25), A80 vs. A10E10 p=0.018). NMD was improved by A80 but not by A10E10 (absolute change NMD: A80+2.7+/-4.6%, A10E10+0.7+/-3.5%, p=0.12). Both treatment groups caused a comparable reduction of CRP and did not effect urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha excretion. There was no correlation between FMD or NMD change and LDL-cholesterol change in either treatment group. The present findings clearly suggest that in the presence of comparable LDL-lowering effects of both treatment forms, LDL-cholesterol independent effects of high dose atorvastatin therapy account for the improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with stable CAD.

Abstract 485 of 500

Endothelial function is impaired in healthy subjects at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). We investigated whether endothelial dysfunction can be normalized by statin therapy in this potentially predisposed population. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured in 56 first-degree relatives (FDRs) (normotensive, normal glucose tolerance) and 20 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched controls with no family history of DM. Other measurements included insulin resistance index using the homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)), plasma lipids, and markers of inflammation. The FDRs were then randomized and treated with atorvastatin (80 mg) or placebo daily in a 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The FDRs had significantly impaired FMD (4.4 +/- 8.1% vs. 13.0 +/- 4.2%; P < 0.001), higher HOMA(IR) (1.72 +/- 1.45 vs. 1.25 +/- 0.43; P = 0.002), and elevated levels of plasma markers of inflammation-highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (2.6 +/- 3.8 mg/L vs. 0.7 +/- 1.0 mg/L; P = 0.06), interleukin (IL)-6 (0.07 +/- 0.13 ng/mL vs. 0.03 +/- 0.01 ng/mL; P < 0.001), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM) (267.7 +/- 30.7 ng/mL vs. 238.2 +/- 20.4 ng/mL; P < 0.001). FMD improved in the atorvastatin-treated subjects when compared with the placebo-treated subjects (atorvastatin, from 3.7 +/- 8.5% to 9.8 +/- 7.3%; placebo, from 3.9 +/- 5.6% to 4.7 +/- 4.2%; P = 0.001). There were also reductions in the levels of IL-6 (0.08 +/- 0.02 ng/mL vs. 0.04 +/- 0.01 ng/mL; P < 0.001) and hsCRP (3.0 +/- 3.9 mg/L vs. 1.0 +/- 1.3 mg/L; P = 0.006). Our study suggests that treatment with atorvastatin may improve endothelial function and decrease levels of inflammatory markers in FDRs of type 2 DM patients.

Abstract 486 of 500

In a randomized, double-blind study, we administered placebo and diclofenac sodium 100 mg suppositories 1 h pre-operatively and on the first post-operative morning to 22 adult patients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery. A standardized post-operative intravenous fluid regimen was instituted until oral fluids were tolerated. Renal function was assessed pre-operatively, and on the first and second post-operative days by the measurement of urine output, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium and NAG (N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase) levels and serum creatinine, urea, sodium and potassium concentrations. On the first post-operative day, the diclofenac group demonstrated a reduced urinary sodium excretion. On the second post-operative day, a reduced urinary NAG/creatinine ratio was observed in the diclofenac group when compared to placebo. We conclude that peri-operative administration of diclofenac causes changes in renal function consistent with prostaglandin inhibition on the first post-operative day but had no lasting adverse effects in this group of patients. Our results reinforce the need for caution when administering this drug in the context of pre-existing renal impairment.

Abstract 487 of 500

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate four different forms of treatment in young infants admitted for acute wheezing (AW). Seventy-nine infants less than one year of age were randomly assigned to one of five groups. Group 1 received nebulized fenoterol plus ipratropium bromide, group 2 fenoterol, group 3 fenoterol plus steroids, and group 4 aminophylline, IV, plus steroids and oral fenoterol; the control group, or group 5, received nebulized normal saline solution. Clinical evaluation was done by means of a scoring system. The effectiveness of treatments was estimated by a score decrease in the first 24 hours, by the percentage of patients whose scores did not decrease during the same period, and by the number of days in the hospital. All infants had significantly decreased scores, except those in the control group; the aminophylline group included a greater percentage of patients who did not abate their scores, and they stayed in the hospital for more days than those in the other groups. The fenoterol group had the shortest hospital stay. All four treatments produced objective clinical improvement in bronchial obstruction. However, the nebulized bronchodilator treatments were more effective than aminophylline IV in decreasing scores on the first day, and they resulted in shorter hospitalization.

Abstract 488 of 500

Hepatic metastases derive most of their blood supply from the hepatic artery; therefore, for patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of chemotherapy may improve outcome. In a multi-institutional trial, 135 patients were randomly assigned to receive HAI versus systemic bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin. The primary end point was survival; secondary end points were response, recurrence, toxicity, quality of life, cost, and the influence of molecular markers. Overall survival was significantly longer for HAI versus systemic treatment (median, 24.4 v 20 months; P = .0034), as were response rates (47% and 24%; P = .012) and time to hepatic progression (THP; 9.8 v 7.3 months; P = .034). Time to extrahepatic progression (7.7 v 14.8 months; P = .029) was significantly shorter in the HAI group. Quality-of-life measurements showed improved physical functioning in the HAI group at the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. Toxicity included grade > or = 3 neutropenia (2% and 45%; P < .01), stomatitis (0% and 24%; P < .01), and bilirubin elevation (18.6% and 0; P < .01) in the HAI and systemic treatment groups, respectively. A greater proportion of men versus women receiving HAI experienced biliary toxicity (37% and 15%, respectively; P = .05). For HAI patients with thymidylate synthase levels in tumor less than or > or = 4, the median survival was 24 and 14 months, respectively (P = .17). HAI therapy increased overall survival, response rate, THP, and was associated with better physical functioning compared with systemic therapy. Additional studies need to address the overall benefit and cost of new chemotherapy agents versus HAI alone or the combination of HAI with new agents.

Abstract 489 of 500

A dual-centre, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of short courses of therapy with imiquimod 5% cream in clearing >/=75% of baseline solar keratoses (SK) within a field of treatment. Subjects with 5-15 baseline SK within one treatment area (scalp, forehead and temples, or both cheeks) were randomized to apply imiquimod or vehicle cream to the entire treatment area three times a week for 3 weeks. Subjects were assessed 4 weeks after completing the first course for clearance of lesions. Subjects with <75% clearance were commenced on a second 3-week course of study cream. Subjects with >/=75% clearance were followed up until study completion without further therapy. All subjects were evaluated at the study endpoint of 14 weeks after initiating therapy for assessment of the primary outcome (>/=75% clearance of baseline solar keratoses). Twenty-one out of 29 (72%) imiquimod-treated subjects cleared >/=75% of baseline lesions compared with 3/10 (30%) subjects using the vehicle cream (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.027). Imiquimod was well tolerated. The present study has a short follow-up endpoint, but suggests that imiquimod is a potential therapeutic alternative in patients with SK.

Abstract 490 of 500

In a double-blind study in a primary-care setting in France, outpatients fulfilling DSM IV criteria for a major depressive episode were randomised to receive sertraline (50 to 150 mg/day; n = 122) or fluoxetine (20 to 60 mg/day; n = 120). Assessments, including clinical evaluation [Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)] and quality of life [Functional Status Questionnaire (FSQ)], were made at study entry and after 4 and 6 months of treatment. Use of medical services, absences from work and productivity losses were recorded for calculation of direct and indirect costs from both the overall societal perspective and in terms of sickness insurance. In total, 231 patients (116 receiving sertraline, 115 receiving fluoxetine) were included in an intention-to-treat analysis assessed up to the last visit. Statistically significant clinical and quality-of-life improvements from baseline were observed in both treatment groups, with no between-group differences. Utilisation of medical resources was higher in fluoxetine-treated patients, with significantly more consultations with specialists. The 2 treatment groups were similar in terms of number of hospitalisations and duration of stay, whether related to depression or not. There were no significant differences between groups for work or productivity losses. Cost comparisons favoured sertraline treatment from both the societal (FF7780 vs FF8706) and sickness insurance (FF2936 vs FF3224) viewpoints, with cost differentials of FF926 and FF288, respectively. From the societal perspective, the total cost per patient over the 6-month course of the trial, irrespective of the study treatment given, was FF8241, and the corresponding sickness insurance cost was FF3079. At the time of the study, FF1 = $US0.1993.

Fifty-three hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients were treated with either propranolol, chlorpromazine or placebo in a double-blind randomized trials for up to three months. Propranolol in a usual dose of 640 mg/day, produced marked cardiovascular effects but no improvement in schizophrenic symptomatology relative to placebo. The effects of chlorpromazine were small and inconsistent.

Abstract 492 of 500

alpha4 integrins are important mediators of leukocyte migration across vascular endothelium. This pilot placebo-controlled study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of natalizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody to alpha4 integrin, in patients with mild to moderately active Crohn's disease. Thirty patients with active Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] > or =151 and < or =450) received a 3-mg/kg infusion of natalizumab (n = 18) or placebo (n = 12) by double-blind randomization. The study's primary endpoint was change in CDAI at week 2. At week 2, the CDAI decreased significantly from baseline after infusion of natalizumab (mean 45 points) but not placebo (mean 11 points). Seven (39%) natalizumab-treated patients achieved remission at week 2, compared with 1 (8%) treated with placebo. In contrast, 4 (33%) of the placebo-treated patients required rescue medication by week 2, compared with 2 (11%) natalizumab-treated patients. Significant increases in circulating B and T lymphocytes were detected only after natalizumab administration. The frequency of commonly reported adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. A single 3-mg/kg natalizumab infusion was well tolerated by Crohn's disease patients, although the dose used may have been suboptimal. Elevated circulating lymphocyte levels after natalizumab suggest interrupted lymphocyte trafficking. Natalizumab therapy in active Crohn's disease merits further investigation.

Abstract 494 of 500

In Graves' hyperthyroidism treated with antithyroid drugs (ATD), the overall relapse rate reaches 30-50% following ATD discontinuation. Conflicting results have previously been reported with regard to the usefulness of combining ATD with thyroxine (l-T4), and thereafter maintaining l-T4 treatment after ATD withdrawal. Also, clinicians are in search of useful parameters to predict the risk of a recurrence of hyperthyroidism after ATD treatment. Eighty-two consecutive patients (70 women and 12 men; mean age 36 years) with a first episode of Graves' hyperthyroidism were investigated prospectively; they were treated with ATD for a total of 15 months, combined with l-T4 (for at least 12 months) after they had reached euthyroidism, with the aim of maintaining serum TSH below 2.5 mU/l during the combined therapy. Following ATD discontinuation, the patients were randomly assigned (double-blind placebo-controlled trial) to taking 100 microg/day l-T4 (vs placebo) for an additional year. The following determinations were carried out at initial diagnosis: serum total T4 and tri-iodothyronine (T3), free T4 and T3, TSH, TSH-receptor antibodies (TSHR-Ab), thyroid scintigraphy and echography. During ATD treatment, serum free T4 and T3 and TSH concentrations were recorded after 1 (optional), 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months, and echography at the end of ATD treatment. During the randomized trial, serum free T4 and T3 and TSH concentrations were checked every 3 months (or until a recurrence). TSHR-Ab titers were measured at initial diagnosis, after 6 months with ATD, and at the end of ATD treatment. l-T4 administration, both during and after ATD treatment, did not improve the final outcome and recurrence rates were similar in placebo and l-T4-treated patients (30%). Two parameters were identified that might be useful to help predict recurrence risks after ATD: (i) positive TSHR-Ab (at the end of ATD treatment) was significantly associated with a greatly increased recurrence risk; and (ii) despite the relatively small number of patients who were smokers, regular cigarette smoking was shown, for the first time, to be significantly associated with an increased recurrence risk. Also, the deleterious effect of smoking was shown to manifest its impact independently of TSHR-Ab titers at the end of ATD treatment. Thus, compared with the overall 30% recurrence risk, non-smoking patients with a negative TSHR-Ab (at the end of ATD) had a lower (18%) recurrence risk; smoking patients with negative TSHR-Ab (at the end of ATD) had a 57% recurrence risk; non-smoking patients with positive TSHR-Ab (at the end of ATD) had a high (86%) recurrence risk; the recurrence risk was 100% in those few patients who both smoked and maintained a positive TSHR-Ab at the end of ATD treatment. The present study confirmed that l-T4 administration during and after ATD withdrawal did not improve remission rate. Two factors, namely positive TSHR-Ab at the end of ATD treatment and regular smoking habits may represent clinically useful (albeit not absolute) predictors of the risk of recurrence in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism treated with ATD. However, due to the relatively small number of smoking patients in the present cohort, this conclusion needs to be confirmed by a larger study.

Abstract 495 of 500

Glycerol-impregnated chromic catgut and untreated chromic catgut were compared in a randomized controlled trial involving 737 consecutive women who required repair of perineal trauma following spontaneous vaginal delivery. Medical staff preference was equally divided between the two materials. More untreated chromic catgut sutures required removal both by 10 days and by 3 months postpartum. Women whose perineal trauma was repaired with glycerol-impregnated chromic catgut were 10% more likely to have perineal pain at 10 days and 33% more likely to suffer from dyspareunia in the 3 months following delivery. The high rates of maternal morbidity associated with glycerol-impregnated chromic catgut appear to preclude its use for perineal repair.

Abstract 496 of 500

A randomized, controlled, double-masked clinical trial was conducted with a combination antiviral-antimediator treatment for experimental rhinovirus colds. In all, 150 healthy men and women (aged 18-51 years) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: intranasal interferon (IFN)-alpha2b (6 x 10(6) U every 12 h x 3) plus oral chlorpheniramine (12 mg extended release) and ibuprofen (400 mg) every 12 h for 4.5 days (n=59 subjects); intranasal placebo plus oral chlorpheniramine and ibuprofen (n=61 subjects); or intranasal and oral placebos (n=30 subjects). Treatment was started 24 h after intranasal viral challenge. During the 4.5 days of treatment with IFN-alpha2b, chlorpheniramine, and ibuprofen, the daily mean total symptom score was reduced by 33%-73%, compared with placebo. Treatment reduced the severity of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, sore throat, cough, and headache and reduced nasal mucus production, nasal tissue use, and virus concentrations in nasal secretions. IFN-alpha2b added to the effectiveness of chlorpheniramine and ibuprofen and was well tolerated.

Abstract 498 of 500

To investigate the effects of aprotinin on red cell (RC) immune function in the patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 20 patients who received valve replacement procedure were prospectively studied. The patients were randomly assigned to aprotinin group and control group. Red blood cell C3b receptor ratio (RC3bRR), red blood cell immune-component ratio (RICR), plasma C3, C4, CH50 and IgG level were determined before operation, at the end of CPB and 1st, 3rd, 7th postoperative days. Our results showed that: (1) The blood requirement was reduced in aprotinin group. (2) After bypass, plasma C3, C4, CH50 was maintained in aprotinin group, while they declined in control group. (3) Plasma level IgG fell in both groups, but at 7th postoperative day it recovered in aprotinin group while the level stayed at low level in control group. (4) The RC3bRR and RICR was mildly inhibited in aprotinin group. It is concluded that the impairment of RC immune function caused by CPB can be mitigated by aprotinin, which may be related to the effects of aprotinin in blood sparing, restriction of complement activation, and reduction of blood requirement which could mitigate the non-specific inflammatory reaction.
