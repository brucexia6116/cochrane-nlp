Abstract 1 of 500

Prothrombin fragments (F1+2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and D-dimers, markers of hemostatic system activation, were measured in <n>59</n> consecutive patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients were randomly treated either with <tx1>subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UH) administered in two to three subcutaneous doses adjusted to activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)</tx1> or with <tx2_a>low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (dalteparin) administered in a fixed dose of 200 IU/kg body weight in one subcutaneous injection daily</tx2_a>. Before treatment, F1+2, TAT and D-dimer were above the cut-off level in 27/59 (46%), 34/59 (58%) and all (100%) patients, respectively. Significant associations were observed between F1+2 and TAT (r=.66, P<.001), TAT and D-dimer (r=.36, P<.005) and F1+2 and D-dimer (r=.30, P<.050). On the third day of treatment, F1+2 and TAT significantly decreased to reference values in almost all patients (in 64/66 determinations of both F1+2 and TAT) and remained low on the seventh day of treatment. Compared to pretreatment values, a nonsignificant decrease of D-dimer was noted in both groups, but all values remained above the cut-off value. When markers of hemostatic system activation in the UH and LMWH groups were compared, no significant differences were observed. It was concluded that <tx1_a>subcutaneous UH in an APTT-adjusted dose</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>subcutaneous LMWH in a once-daily weight-adjusted dose</tx2_a> controlled these markers of hemostatic system activation in a similar manner.

Abstract 2 of 500

Among all the causes of chronic low back pain, myofascial pain syndrome of the spinal stabilizer muscles is one of the most frequent, yet underconsidered sources of pain. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of type-A botulinum toxin (BTX-A) in relieving myofascial pain in patients experiencing mechanical low back pain due to bilateral myofascial pain syndrome involving the iliopsoas and/or the quadratus lumborum muscles. Each of the 27 enrolled patients received a bilateral, fluoroscopically guided injection in the affected muscle(s) to randomly deliver BTX-A in one side of the low back and a control drug (randomly constituted by NaCl 0.9% or bupivacaine 0.25%) in the opposite side. To evaluate the effects of treatment on daily life activities and psychologic status, 5 different questionnaires were administered (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale [HAD-A and HAD-D], Lattinen, Oswestry, and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index). BTX-A injection did not significantly reduce visual analog scale scores more than treatment with NaCl or bupivacaine in the contralateral side; furthermore, the treatments administered did not result in a significant improvement of patients' daily life activities or psychologic status. Although a trend toward a decrease in postintervention visual analog scale scores could be recognized in all low back sides, this trend was significant only in the sides treated with BTX-A. BTX-A seems to provide significant postintervention pain relief. However, considering its high cost and the small differences compared with control treatments, its use should be reserved only for patients with pain refractory to other invasive treatments.

Abstract 3 of 500

<tx1>A once-daily regimen of cefazolin (2 g intravenously [iv]) plus probenecid (1 g by mouth)</tx1> was compared with <tx2>a once-daily regimen of ceftriaxone (1 g iv) plus oral placebo</tx2> in a randomized, double-blind equivalence trial of home-based therapy for moderate-to-severe cellulitis in adults. For the assessable recipients of cefazolin-probenecid (n=59) and ceftriaxone-placebo (n=57), clinical cure occurred at the end of treatment in 86% and 96% (P=.11), respectively, and was maintained at 1 month of follow-up in 96% and 91% (P=.55), respectively. The mean number of treatment doses (+/-standard deviation) given was similar in the 2 treatment arms (6.97+/-2.6 for <tx1_a>cefazolin-probenecid</tx1_a> and 6.12+/-2.1 for <tx2_a>ceftriaxone-placebo</tx2_a>; P=.06). The median antibiotic trough concentrations were 2.35 microgram/mL for cefazolin and 15.45 microgram/mL for ceftriaxone. Patients in the 2 treatment arms were similar with regard to overall rates of adverse reaction (P=.15), but nausea was more common among those in the cefazolin-probenecid arm (P=.048). The once-daily regimen of cefazolin-probenecid is a cheap, practical, and effective treatment option for moderate-to-severe cellulitis, and it avoids the need to use third-generation cephalosporins in most patients.

Abstract 4 of 500

We evaluated the efficacy of pramipexole versus placebo in restless legs syndrome (RLS) for 6 weeks. Overall, <n>345</n> patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive either <tx1>placebo</tx1> (n = <n1>115</n1>) or <tx2>pramipexole</tx2> (n = <n2>230</n2>) with a starting dose of 0.125 mg/day. The dose was individually optimized according to the Patient Global Impression (PGI) assessment, up to a maximum of 0.75 mg/day. The primary endpoint consisted of two assessments: the change from baseline in the International RLS Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) and the proportion of patients with Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) assessments of "much/very much improved" (CGI-I responders) at week 6. Secondary endpoints included PGI and IRLS responder rates. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. At baseline, mean IRLS scores were 24.9 (<tx1_a>placebo</tx1_a>) and 24.7 (<tx2_a>pramipexole</tx2_a>), representing severely affected patients. After 6 weeks, adjusted mean reductions (+/-SE) in IRLS score were 5.7 (+/-0.9) for <tx1_a>placebo</tx1_a> (median dose 0.47 mg/day) and 12.3 (+/-0.6) for <tx2_a>pramipexole</tx2_a> (median dose 0.35 mg/day; P < 0.0001). CGI-I responder rates were 32.5% (<tx1_a>placebo</tx1_a>) and 62.9% (<tx2_a>pramipexole</tx2_a>) (P < 0.0001). For all secondary endpoints, <tx2_a>pramipexole</tx2_a> showed superior results. <tx2_a>Pramipexole</tx2_a> was well tolerated throughout the study. (c) 2006 Movement Disorder Society.

Abstract 5 of 500

To evaluate whether isopropyl alcohol vapor is an effective treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting. Double-blind, randomized, controlled study. Pediatric surgery center. 91 ASA physical status I and II children age 6-16 years, scheduled to undergo general anesthesia and elective outpatient surgery. Subjects were randomized to inhale isopropyl alcohol or saline. The intervention was repeated up to three times. If postoperative nausea or vomiting persisted after three sequences, intravenous ondansetron was administered as rescue therapy. Improvement in nausea was assessed using a visual analog scale, and improvement in vomiting was assessed using categorical analysis. After three treatment sequences, 65% of the children in the treatment group and 26% of the children in the control group had a significant reduction in the severity of either nausea or vomiting (p = 0.03). However, 54% of subjects in the treatment group and 80% of subjects in the control group had recurrent nausea or vomiting within 20 to 60 minutes. Under the conditions of this study, repetitive inhaled isopropyl alcohol only achieved a transient antiemetic effect in children with established postoperative nausea or vomiting following general anesthesia and surgery.

Abstract 6 of 500

To compare the efficacy and safety of the <tx1_a>low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dalteparin</tx1_a> with <tx2_a>unfractionated heparin (UFH)</tx2_a> in the acute treatment of DVT patients who had not previously received UFH. An open randomized multicentre trial with blinded analysis of venograms. Seven hospitals in Sweden, Finland and the USA. A total of <n>330</n> patients, of 20 years or older, with suspected DVT, verified using venography. <tx1>Fixed-dose dalteparin (200 IU kg-1) given as a once-daily subcutaneous injection</tx1>, or <tx2>aPTT adjusted i.v. UFH infusion</tx2> for 6 to 10 days. Change in Marder score in patients with confirmed DVT and two evaluable venograms; PE, bleeding events and follow-up. Marder scores improved in 51% (95% CI 42-60%) of <n1>92</n1> patients treated with <tx1_a>dalteparin</tx1_a> and in 62% (95% CI 53-70%) of <n2>98</n2> patients treated with <tx2_a>UFH</tx2_a> (P = 0.152). One <tx1_a>dalteparin</tx1_a>-treated patient had a PE confirmed by V/Q scan; another had progressive thrombosis with swelling in the affected limb. Bleeding complications occurred in six patients in each group. One patient treated with <tx1_a>dalteparin</tx1_a> and five treated with <tx2_a>UFH</tx2_a> died during the 6-month follow-up period as a result of underlying malignancy or heart disease. The 6-month recurrence rate was low with both treatments (<tx1_a>dalteparin</tx1_a>, 3/97; <tx2_a>UFH</tx2_a>, 2/103). <tx1_a>Fixed-dose subcutaneous dalteparin</tx1_a> given once daily from the start of treatment is of equivalent efficacy and safety to <tx2_a>conventional UFH therapy</tx2_a> in the routine management of DVT.

Abstract 7 of 500

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> with that of <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> in patients with an overactive bladder. A randomized, double-blind, <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>-controlled, parallel group, multinational phase-III study was conducted in urology and gynaecology clinics in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Sweden. The study enrolled <n>293</n> patients with urodynamically confirmed bladder overactivity, increased frequency of micturition (> or = micturitions/24 h) and symptoms of urgency and/or urge incontinence (> or = 1 episode/24 h). Patients received either <tx1>tolterodine (2 mg twice daily)</tx1> or <tx2>oxybutynin (5 mg three times daily)</tx2> or <tx3>placebo</tx3>. Doses could be reduced, to prevent withdrawal, to 1 mg or 2.5 mg, respectively. The main outcome measures were the mean change from baseline in frequency of micturition/24 h, the number of incontinent episodes/24 h and volume voided per micturition. After 12 weeks' treatment, the mean frequency of micturition decreased by 21% and 19.5% in those receiving tolterodine (n = <n1>118</n1>) and oxybutynin (n = <n2>118</n2>), respectively, and by 10.5% in those on placebo (n = <n3>57</n3>). Among those with urge incontinence at baseline (75% of patients), the mean number of incontinent episodes decreased by 47%, 71% and 19%, respectively, in those receiving <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a>, <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> and <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>. The effect of <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> on these two micturition variables was statistically equivalent. There was also a comparable increase in mean volume voided per micturition in the <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> (27%) and <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> groups (31%), compared with 7% in the <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a> group. Dry mouth was the most common adverse event and was reported with greater frequency and intensity among patients receiving <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> than among those receiving either <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> or <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>. In the <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> group, more patients also withdrew because of adverse events and a greater proportion required dose reduction as a result of adverse events. Despite dose reduction, the frequency of adverse events and the intensity of dry mouth remained higher among those receiving <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a> (2.5 mg three times daily) than in patients who remained on <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> 2 mg twice daily. <tx1_a>Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily</tx1_a> is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of bladder overactivity. <tx1_a>Tolterodine</tx1_a> was better tolerated than <tx2_a>oxybutynin</tx2_a>, particularly with respect to the frequency and intensity of dry mouth, but had comparable clinical efficacy. The superior tolerability of <tx1_a>tolterodine</tx1_a> therefore allows more patients to remain on effective therapy than the current most commonly prescribed agent for the treatment of the overactive bladder.

Abstract 8 of 500

Whilst elevated urinary transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta) is associated with chronic renal dysfunction its role in acute peri-operative renal dysfunction is unknown. In contrast, peri-operative increases in urinary IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and TNF soluble receptor-2 (TNFsr-2) mirror pro-inflammatory activity in the nephron and correlate with renal complications. Steroids modulate some plasma cytokines (decreasing TNFalpha, IL-8, IL-6 and increasing IL-10), whereas ability to reduce plasma and urinary TNFsr-2 and IL-1ra and peri-operative renal injury is unknown. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were randomised to receive methylprednisolone (n = 18) or placebo (n = 17) before induction of anaesthesia. Plasma and urinary pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine balance was determined along with subclinical proximal tubular injury and dysfunction, measured by urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG)/creatinine and alpha-1-microglobulin/creatinine ratios, respectively. In the control group compared with baseline, plasma IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-10, IL-1ra and TNFsr-2 were significantly elevated along with urinary IL-1ra, TNFsr-2 and TGFbeta1. Urinary NAG/creatinine and alpha-1-microglobulin/creatinine ratios rose from completion of revascularisation until 6 h with recovery at 24 h with a further rise in NAG/creatinine ratio at 48 h. Compared to placebo, the methylprednisolone group showed significantly reduced plasma IL-8, TNFalpha, IL-1ra and TNFsr-2 whereas plasma IL-10 increased. Compared to placebo, the methylprednisolone group demonstrated significantly reduced urinary NAG/creatinine ratio, TNFsr-2 and TGFbeta1 at 24 h whereas urinary alpha-1-microglobulin/creatinine ratios increased. Methylprednisolone administration during cardiac surgery significantly reduces plasma and urinary TNFsr-2 and IL-1ra, urinary TGFbeta1 and subclinical renal injury but not dysfunction.

Abstract 9 of 500

(1) To test whether <tx1_a>early prophylactic antidepressive treatment by mianserin</tx1_a> is able to prevent poststroke depression, and (2) to discover whether mianserin as an antidepressant has any beneficial influence on the outcome of ischaemic stroke. A randomised, double blind, <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> controlled study involved <n>100</n> consecutive patients under 71 years old admitted to hospital for an acute ischaemic stroke; they were enrolled to receive <tx1>60 mg/day mianserin</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2> for 1 year. They were examined on admission, and at 2, 6, 12, and 18 months with depression, stroke, and functional outcome scales. According to DSM-III-R, the prevalence of major depression was 6% at the initial stage, 11% at 1 year, and 16% at 18 months. At no time point did prevalences differ between the treatment groups, nor were differences found in depression scales, although at 2 months a greater improvement from initial assessment on the Hamilton depression scale was evident in patients on <tx1_a>mianserin</tx1_a> (p=0.05). Some beneficial changes on the Hamilton depression scale and Beck depression inventory were found in patients older than 56 (median age) and in men treated with <tx1_a>mianserin</tx1_a>, but not in other subgroups. <tx1_a>Mianserin</tx1_a> treatment did not affect stroke outcome as measured by neurological status, nor did it have any influence on functional outcome as measured by Rankin scale or Barthel index. It was not possible to show that early initiation of antidepressant therapy can prevent poststroke depression, because the prevalence of poststroke depression remained low even in patients on <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>. In this stroke population with a low rate of depressive patients, antidepressive medical treatment failed to affect stroke outcome.

Abstract 10 of 500

The clinical features of <n>49</n> patients who had sustained small strokes in the internal carotid artery territory, who were normotensive, free from cardiac or other relevant disease, and who each had a normal appropriate single vessel angiogram are presented. These were randomized into two groups: group A, 25 patients, who received only <tx1>supportive treatment</tx1>; group B, 24 patients who were treated with <tx2>anticoagulants</tx2> for an average period of 18 months. There was a reduced incidence of neurological episodes during the administration of <tx2_a>anticoagulant therapy</tx2_a> but, after treatment was discontinued, there was no significant difference between the two groups. In view of the relatively benign prognosis for this syndrome, unless special facilities exist for the personal control of <tx2_a>anticoagulant treatment</tx2_a>, the dangers may outweigh the benefits.

Abstract 11 of 500

To assess the effect of a short course of low-dose oral corticosteroid used as an adjunct to antimicrobials in patients with acute infective sinusitis. Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study including 42 patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute infective sinusitis. The study was performed at three primary healthcare sites in South Africa during the period January-November 2003. Two equal groups received either betamethasone 1mg orally (n = 21; the treatment group) or placebo tablets (n = 21; the placebo group) once a day in the morning for five consecutive days. All patients received amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 625mg orally, three times daily for 5 days. Patients rated symptoms on a daily symptom score card for 5 days and were examined by the investigator at diagnosis (day 0) and on the second visit (day 6). Headache, facial pain, nasal congestion and dizziness improved significantly from baseline in the treatment group compared with the placebo group over 5 days of treatment (p = 0.028, p </= 0.047, p </= 0.04 and p </= 0.051, respectively). Percussion tenderness improved significantly (p = 0.049) and clearance of purulent secretions almost reached significance (p = 0.058) in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. This study suggests a benefit of oral corticosteroid added to antimicrobial treatment of acute sinusitis and documents the first successful use of a short course of low-dose oral corticosteroid in patients with acute infective sinusitis.

Abstract 12 of 500

<tx1_a>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts</tx1_a> reduce portal pressure and can control ascites in patients with cirrhosis. We carried out a controlled study to evaluate this procedure for the management of refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis and to clarify its mechanism of action. <n>Twenty-five</n> patients with refractory ascites were included in the trial; <n1>13</n1> were randomly assigned to <tx1>shunts</tx1> and <n2>12</n2> to <tx2>paracentesis</tx2>. Four patients in each group were Child-Pugh class C and the others were class B. Follow-up ranged from 9 to 34 months. Hemodynamic values, liver and renal tests and neurohumoral factors were measured before and at 4 months after inclusion. <tx1_a>Shunts</tx1_a> were successfully placed in 10 out of 13 patients. At 4 months, ascites had improved in all class B patients in the <tx1_a>shunt</tx1_a> group and in none of the patients in the <tx2_a>paracentesis</tx2_a> group (p < 0.05); ascites did not improve in any of the class C patients in either of the groups. At 2 years, the overall survival rate was 29 +/- 13% (mean +/- SE) in the <tx1_a>shunt</tx1_a> group and 56 +/- 17% in the <tx2_a>paracentesis</tx2_a> group (p < 0.05). In class B patients, there was no significant difference in mortality. At 4 months, portal pressure was significantly lower than before the <tx1_a>shunt</tx1_a>, while plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide were significantly higher and plasma levels of renin and norepinephrine significantly lower. In this trial, intrahepatic shunts were effective on refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis. However, the overall survival rate was lower in shunted patients than in those treated with <tx2_a>paracentesis</tx2_a>. The efficacy of <tx1_a>intrahepatic shunts</tx1_a> on ascites was only observed in class B patients. Survival did not improve in class B patients, and decreased in class C patients compared to <tx2_a>paracentesis</tx2_a>. The efficacy of shunts on <tx1_a>ascites</tx1_a> might be due to neurohumoral factors which control natriuresis and depend on hepatic sinusoidal pressure.

Abstract 13 of 500

Cough may be the consequence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and inflammation. This study was designed to investigate the short-term effects of an <tx1_a>inhaled steroid (fluticasone propionate (FP))</tx1_a> on cough, and to determine the effects of smoking, BHR, allergy and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on the efficacy of FP. In a community-based primary healthcare centre, <n>135</n> previously healthy adults suffering from cough for > or =2 weeks were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled trial of <tx1>inhaled FP 500 microg b.i.d. for 2 weeks</tx1>. Participants completed daily diary cards of lower respiratory tract symptoms. The primary outcome measure was the decrease in mean total daily cough score (0-6) during the second week of treatment. In the <tx1_a>FP</tx1_a> group, the cough score decreased from 3.8 at baseline to mean+/-SEM 1.4+/-0.2 during the second week. In the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group, this decrease was from 3.8 to 1.9+/-0.1 and was statistically significantly less. A favourable effect of <tx1_a>FP</tx1_a> was only detectable in nonsmokers, in whom the score was 0.9 points lower compared with placebo. The clinical relevance of this finding has to be established further. Allergy, FEV1 and BHR at baseline did not affect the efficacy of <tx1_a>FP</tx1_a>. In conclusion, anti-inflammatory treatment with the <tx1_a>inhaled steroid fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> reduces cough in otherwise healthy adults who do not smoke.

Abstract 14 of 500

To examine the effect of a reduced sodium and increased potassium and magnesium intake on blood pressure. Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. General population of a suburb of Rotterdam. 100 men and women between 55 and 75 years of age with untreated mild to moderate hypertension. During 24 weeks the intervention group received a mineral salt (sodium: potassium: magnesium 8:6:1) and foods prepared with the mineral salt. Controls received common salt and foods. Change in blood pressure. Complete follow up was achieved for 97 of the 100 randomised subjects. Systolic blood pressure (mean of measurements at weeks 8, 16, and 24) fell by 7.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 4.0 to 11.2) and diastolic blood pressure by 3.3 mm Hg (0.8 to 5.8) in the mineral salt group compared with the controls, with a 28% decrease in urinary sodium excretion and a 22% increase in urinary potassium excretion. Twenty five weeks after the study the difference in blood pressure between the groups was no longer detectable. Replacing common sodium salt by a low sodium, high potassium, high magnesium mineral salt could offer a valuable non-pharmacological approach to lowering blood pressure in older people with mild to moderate hypertension.

Abstract 15 of 500

Combination bronchodilator therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is available widely throughout the world except in North America. Previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the advantages of <tx3_a>combining anticholinergic therapy with sympathomimetic therapy</tx3_a> in COPD. We report the results of a 12-week prospective, double-blind, parallel-group evaluation of the use of the following: <tx1>albuterol, a beta-adrenergic agent</tx1>; <tx2>ipratropium, an anticholinergic agent</tx2>; or <tx3>a combination of the two</tx3>, administered by metered-dose inhaler to patients with moderately severe stable COPD. Following baseline studies, <n>534</n> patients were given one of the three test bronchodilator preparations to be used at home four times daily in addition to oral theophylline and corticosteroids as required. The doses of the latter two drugs were kept stable. Subjects were tested on days 1, 29, 57, and 85. Analysis of 1-s forced expiratory volume (FEV1) curves on those test days indicated that the combination was superior to either single agent alone in peak effect, in the effect during the first 4 h after dosing, and in the total area under the curve of the FEV1 response. The mean peak percent increases in FEV1 over baseline on the four test days were 31 to 33 percent for the <tx3_a>combination</tx3_a>, 24 to 25 percent for <tx2_a>ipratropium</tx2_a>, and 24 to 27 percent for <tx1_a>albuterol</tx1_a>. The differences between the <tx3_a>combination</tx3_a> and <tx1_a><tx2_a>its components</tx2_a></tx1_a> were statistically significant on all test days. The AUC0-4 means for the combination were 21 to 44 percent greater than the <tx2>ipratropium</tx2> means and 30 to 46 percent greater than the <tx1>albuterol</tx1> means. Similar changes were noted in the forced vital capacity curves. Symptom scores did not change over time and did not differ among the treatment groups. We conclude that <tx3_a>the combination of ipratropium and albuterol</tx3_a>, when given by metered-dose inhaler to patients with COPD, is more effective than <tx2_a><tx1_a>either of the two agents alone</tx1_a></tx2_a>. The advantage of <tx3_a>the combination</tx3_a> is apparent primarily during the first 4 h after administration. The availability of <tx3_a>combination therapy by metered-dose inhaler</tx3_a> should help to improve patient compliance.

Abstract 16 of 500

A prospective controlled randomized trial testing <tx1>adjuvant postoperative combination chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, lomustine (CCNU) and vincristine)</tx1> versus <tx2>no adjuvant therapy</tx2> in patients operated on for Dukes' C colorectal cancer is reported. In total <n>334</n> patients aged less than 70 years were recruited: 205 patients with colonic and 99 with rectal cancer, but there were three protocol violations and these cases are excluded from further consideration. Twenty-seven patients had a limited resection of their cancer. After 5 years' follow-up there was no significant difference in the tumour-free survival rate or in the survival rate between the treated and control groups. Twenty-nine of the 147 patients who started chemotherapy discontinued this treatment because of side-effects, mainly from the gastrointestinal tract. In 30 patients treatment was discontinued because of recurrent disease. The conclusion is that <tx1_a>systemic administration of combination chemotherapy for colorectal cancer after operation</tx1_a> is not worthwhile in routine clinical practice.

Abstract 17 of 500

Two intensive chemotherapy regimens CFPMV (Cytoxan [cyclophosphamide], 5-fluorouracil, prednisone, methotrexate, vincristine) and CA (Cytoxan, Adriamycin [doxorubicin]) were tested against a moderate regimen, CFP, in a prospective three-arm, randomized study with crossover when relapse or failure occurred, in order to assess whether the response, duration of remission, and survival can be altered by using more intensive regimens as first-line or as rescue therapy. All three regimens were equally effective as initial chemotherapy: CFP 26/46 (57%); CFPMV 31/48 (65%) and CA 26/47 (55%) (P = 0.61) with the least toxicity for the CFP regimen. Median duration of remission were 9.5, 11, and 9 months, respectively. Complete responses were almost identical in all three regimens: 4/46 (9%); 6/48 (12%) and 5/47 (11%) (P = 0.94). CFPMV was an effective regimen as second-line therapy: 11/33 (33%) or third-line therapy: 7/21 (33%). The CA regimen was equally effective as second-line therapy: 8/25 (32%), suggesting that intensive regimens provide an effective rescue therapy, as well in previous responders as in nonresponders. Initial intensive regimens have not substantially altered long-term survival in the whole group of treated patients, Arm II (CFPMV----CA----CFP) 17.6 months; Arm III (CA----CFP----CFPMV) 12.3 months when compared with initial moderate regimens Arm I (CFP----CFPMV----CA) 16.6 months (P = 0.24). The same lack of difference in survival was noticed in responder patients in each arm: Arm II 19.0 months; Arm III 16.0 months versus Arm I 22.0 months (P = 0.13). Our data suggest that a moderate regimen is as effective as more intense regimens for induction therapy in metastatic breast cancer, with less toxicity, preserving the opportunity for an effective rescue therapy with intensive regimens in second or third-line chemotherapy.

Abstract 18 of 500

Although erythropoietin (EPO) is known to be useful in treating chemotherapy-induced anemia, few data are available on its potential preventive role. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of EPO in preventing the development of clinically significant anemia in patients treated with chemotherapy. <n>Sixty-two</n> early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing <tx>accelerated adjuvant chemotherapy</tx> were randomized to receive <tx1>EPO 150 U/kg three times a week</tx1> or no <tx2>additional treatment</tx2>. Chemotherapy consisted of <tx>six cycles of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 (CEF) intravenously on day 1, every 2 weeks with the support of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), 5 microg/kg subcutaneously from day 4 to day 11</tx>. Throughout the six cycles of chemotherapy, <tx1_a>EPO</tx1_a>-treated patients maintained stable values of hemoglobin, whereas control patients developed a progressive anemia. At the end of <tx_a>chemotherapy</tx_a>, the mean (+/- SD) hemoglobin decrease in the control group was 3.05 g/dL (+/- 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6 to 3.5), whereas in the <tx1_a>EPO</tx1_a> group it was 0.8 (+/- 1.4; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.4). Clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin < or = 10 g/dL) occurred in 16 patients (52%; 95% CI, 33 to 69) in the control arm and in no patient (0%; 95% CI, 0 to 14) in the <tx1_a>EPO</tx1_a> arm (P = .00001). <tx1_a>EPO</tx1_a> prevents anemia in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Further trials are required to identify subsets of patients in which the preventive use of this drug could be cost-effective.

Abstract 19 of 500

Combined hyperlipidemia (CHL) is characterized by a concomitant elevation of plasma levels of triglyceride-rich, very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and cholesterol-rich, low density lipoproteins (LDLs). The predominance of small, dense LDLs contributes significantly to the premature development of coronary artery disease in patients with this atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of <tx1_a>atorvastatin, a newly developed inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase</tx1_a>, on the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated remodeling of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoprotein subspecies, and more specifically, the particle subpopulations of VLDL and LDL in CHL. In parallel, we evaluated the <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a>-induced modulation of the quantitative and qualitative features of atherogenic apo B-containing and cardioprotective apo AI-containing lipoprotein subspecies. <tx1>Atorvastatin therapy (10 mg/d for a 6-week period)</tx1> in patients with a lipid phenotype typical of CHL (n=18) induced reductions of 31% (P<0.0001) and 36% (P<0.0001) in plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, respectively. In addition, <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> significantly reduced VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apo B levels by 43% (P<0.0001), 27% (P=0.0006), and 31% (P<0.0001), respectively. The plasma concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL1, Sf 60 to 400; VLDL2, Sf 20 to 60; and intermediate density lipoproteins, Sf 12 to 20) and of LDL, as determined by chemical analysis, were markedly diminished after drug therapy (-30% and -28%, respectively; P<0.0007). <tx1_a>Atorvastatin</tx1_a> significantly reduced circulating levels of all major LDL subspecies, ie, light (-28%, P<0.0008), intermediate (-27%, P<0.0008), and dense (-32%, P<0.0008) LDL; moreover, in terms of absolute lipoprotein mass, the reduction in dense LDL levels (mean -62 mg/dL) was preponderant. In addition, the reduction in plasma dense LDL concentration after therapy was significantly correlated with a reduction in plasma VLDL1 levels (r=0.429, P=0.0218). <tx1_a>Atorvastatin</tx1_a> induced a significant reduction (-7%, P=0.0039) in total CETP-dependent CET activity, which accurately reflects a reduction in plasma CETP mass concentration. Total CETP-mediated CET from high density lipoproteins to apo B-containing lipoproteins was significantly reduced (-26%, P<0.0001) with drug therapy. Furthermore, CETP activity was significantly correlated with the <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a>-induced reduction in plasma VLDL1 levels (r=0.456, P=0. 0138). Indeed, <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a> significantly and preferentially decreased CET from HDL to the VLDL1 subfraction (-37%, P=0.0064), thereby reducing both the levels (-37%, P=0.0001) and the CE content (-20%, P<0.005) of VLDL1. We interpret our data to indicate that 2 independent but complementary mechanisms may be operative in the <tx1_a>atorvastatin</tx1_a>-induced reduction of atherogenic LDL levels in CHL: first, a significant degree of normalization of both the circulating levels and the quality of their key precursors, ie, VLDL1, and second, enhanced catabolism of the major LDL particle subclasses (ie, light, intermediate, and dense LDL) due to upregulation of hepatic LDL receptors.

Abstract 20 of 500

To evaluate the efficacy of <tx1_a>continuous passive motion (CPM)</tx1_a> in the postoperative management of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. A randomized controlled single-blind trial of <tx1>CPM plus standardized rehabilitation</tx1> vs <tx2>standard rehabilitation alone</tx2>. A referral hospital for arthritis and musculoskeletal care. Consecutive patients with end-stage osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty who had at least 90 degrees of passive knee flexion. One hundred fifty-four patients were eligible and <n>102</n> patients agreed to participate and were randomized. Ninety-three patients completed the study protocol. <tx1_a>Continuous passive motion machines programmed for rate and specified arc of motion within 24 hours of surgery with range increased daily as tolerated with standardized rehabilitation program</tx1_a> compared with <tx2_a>standardized rehabilitation program alone</tx2_a>. Primary outcomes were pain, active and passive knee range of motion, swelling (or circumference), quadriceps strength at postoperative day 7, as well as complications, length of stay, and active and passive range of motion and function at 6 weeks. Use of <tx1_a>CPM</tx1_a> increased active flexion and decreased swelling and the need for manipulations but did not significantly affect pain, active and passive extension, quadriceps strength, or length of hospital stay. At 6 weeks there were no differences between the two groups in either range of motion or function. In this series, use of <tx1_a>CPM</tx1_a> resulted in a net savings of $6764 over conventional rehabilitation in achieving these results. For the average patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty, <tx1_a>CPM</tx1_a> is more effective in improving range of motion, decreasing swelling, and reducing the need for manipulation than is conventional therapy and lowers cost.

Abstract 21 of 500

A 4-week course of high-dose glucocorticoids may cause prolonged adrenal suppression even after a 9-day tapering phase. In this study, adrenal function and signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were prospectively assessed in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after induction treatment including <tx1>high-dose prednisone (PDN)</tx1> or <tx2>dexamethasone (DXM)</tx2>. <n>Sixty-four</n> children with ALL, treated according to the AIEOP ALL 2000 Study protocol, underwent low dose ACTH (LD-ACTH) stimulation 24 hr after the last tapered steroid dose. In those with impaired cortisol response, additional LD ACTH tests were performed every 1-2 weeks until cortisol levels normalized. Signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency were recorded during the observation period. All patients had normal basal cortisol values at diagnosis. Twenty-four hours after last glucocorticoid dose, morning cortisol was reduced in 40/64 (62.5%) patients. LD-ACTH testing showed adrenal suppression in 52/64 (81.5%) patients. At the following ACTH test 7-14 days later, morning cortisol values were reduced in 8/52 (15.4%) patients and response to the test was impaired in 12/52 (23%). Adrenal function completely recovered in all patients within 10 weeks. No difference was found between patients treated with <tx1_a>PDN</tx1_a> or <tx2_a>DXM</tx2_a>. Almost 35% of children with impaired cortisol values at the first test developed signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. One child developed a severe adrenal crisis during adrenal suppression. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy in ALL children may cause prolonged adrenal suppression and related clinical symptoms. Laboratory monitoring of cortisol levels and steroid coverage during stress episodes may be indicated. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Abstract 22 of 500

Staphylococcal infections are a major cause of catheter infections and peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Since catheter-related infections are associated with nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in this population, we studied the effect of intermittent <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a>, an antibiotic known to decrease S aureus nasal carriage, on catheter-related infections and peritonitis. We randomly assigned <n>64</n> patients to receive either <tx1>rifampin 300 mg twice daily for 5 days every 3 months</tx1> or <tx2>no treatment</tx2>. The <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a>-treated patients had a significant delay in time to first catheter-related infection (P less than 0.015) and significantly fewer catheter-related infections overall (P less than 0.001). The catheter-related infection rate in <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a>-treated patients was .26 per patient-year versus .93 per patient-year in untreated patients. Multivariate analysis defined baseline colonization of nares or catheter exit-site and prior renal transplant as risk factors for catheter-related infections. There was no significant difference in peritonitis rates between groups, although the trend was for a delayed time to first episodes and fewer episodes in <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a>-treated patients. Adverse effects necessitated withdrawal of <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a> in four patients. We conclude that intermittent <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a> administration is effective in decreasing catheter-related infections in a peritoneal dialysis population.

Abstract 23 of 500

Actinic keratosis (AK), the most common premalignant skin condition, can represent a management challenge. Treatment should not only be effective, but also well tolerated and allow for good cosmesis on typical sun-exposed highly visible body sites. The primary objective was to compare the lesion response and subject preference for <tx1>topical methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL)-photodynamic therapy (PDT)</tx1> vs. <tx2>cryotherapy</tx2> for the treatment of AK. In this 24-week, multicentre, randomized, intraindividual (right-left) study, subjects received both one treatment session of MAL-PDT and a double freeze-thaw cryotherapy; the treatments were randomly allocated to either side of the face/scalp. Lesions with a noncomplete response were retreated after 12 weeks. The primary assessments were the subject's overall preference and lesion response at week 24. Secondary assessments included lesion response at week 12, cosmetic outcome, subject and investigator cosmetic outcome preference at week 24, and investigator overall preference at week 24. Skin discomfort and adverse events were also evaluated. In total, <n>119</n> subjects with 1,501 lesions were included in the study. At week 12, treatment with <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> resulted in a significantly larger rate of cured lesions relative to <tx2_a>cryotherapy</tx2_a> (percentage lesion reduction from baseline: 86.9% vs. 76.2%; P < 0.001). At week 24, both treatment groups showed a high rate of cured lesions (89.1% for <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> vs. 86.1% for <tx2_a>cryotherapy</tx2_a>; P = 0.20; 95% confidence interval: -1.62 to 7.67). Results for subject and investigator preferences as well as cosmetic outcome favoured <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a>. Both treatment regimens were safe and well tolerated. The present study shows that, when treated with both <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>cryotherapy</tx2_a>, subjects significantly prefer <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> treatment for AK. <tx1_a>MAL-PDT</tx1_a> is an attractive treatment option for AK, with comparable efficacy and superior cosmetic outcomes compared with <tx2_a>double freeze-thaw cryotherapy</tx2_a>.

Abstract 24 of 500

Acute mucositis is a dose-limiting toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Palifermin (a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor; DeltaN23-KGF) stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of mucosal epithelium to reduce mucositis in patients receiving intensive therapy for hematologic cancers. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of palifermin in patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In a phase II trial, standard radiotherapy was delivered in daily 2-Gy fractions to 70 Gy, or hyperfractionated radiotherapy was delivered in 1.25-Gy fractions twice daily to 72 Gy, over 7 weeks. <tx>Chemotherapy included cisplatin 20 mg/m(2) for 4 days and continuous-infusion fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m(2)/d for 4 days on weeks 1 and 5 of irradiation.</tx> Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to <tx1>palifermin 60 microg/kg</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2> once weekly for 10 doses. A follow-up trial evaluated long-term survival. <n1>Sixty-seven</n1> patients received palifermin and <n2>32</n2> received placebo. The median duration of grade >or= 2 mucositis was 6.5 and 8.1 weeks in the <tx1_a>palifermin</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> groups, respectively (P = .157). <tx1_a>Palifermin</tx1_a> appeared to reduce mucositis, dysphagia, and xerostomia during hyperfractionated radiotherapy (n = 40) but not standard radiation therapy (n = 59). Adverse events were similar between treatment groups. <tx1_a>Palifermin</tx1_a> did not alter tumor response or survival. Ten once-weekly doses of <tx1_a>palifermin</tx1_a> at 60 microg/kg were well tolerated. Most patients completed treatment, but <tx1_a>palifermin</tx1_a> did not reduce the morbidity of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Future studies should evaluate higher <tx1_a>palifermin</tx1_a> doses with longer and more standardized assessment of acute mucositis.

Abstract 25 of 500

<tx1_a>Fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> aqueous nasal spray, a new topical corticosteroid, has been proved to be an effective treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis. We studied the effect of <tx1_a>fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> on nasal symptoms, circulating eosinophils, and nasal inflammation in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis after high-load pollen exposure. Moreover, we examined its efficacy in preventing the increase in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (PD20) during the pollen season. We conducted a double-blind, <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled, parallel-group study in patients who had a history of allergic rhinitis in response to pollens of grass and Parietaria species and were living in northern Italy. After a run-in period of 2 weeks, <n1>24</n1> patients were treated with <tx1>fluticasone propionate (200 micrograms, once daily)</tx1>, and <n2>26</n2> patients received <tx2>matched placebo</tx2> for 6 weeks, starting from the beginning of the pollen season. Assessment of efficacy was based on scores of daily nasal symptoms. Nasal lavage was performed at the end of the season, and differential cell count was expressed as percent of total cells. PD20 methacholine was measured at the beginning and end of the season and after the season had ended. <tx1_a>Fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> significantly reduced nasal obstruction, itching, and rhinorrhea. Eosinophils in blood (p < 0.01) and nasal lavage (p < 0.001) were also reduced. Moreover, <tx1_a>fluticasone</tx1_a> significantly attenuated the decrease in mean PD20 methacholine (from 1.95 to 0.89 mg) compared with placebo (from 1.38 to 0.37 mg: p < 0.01). After the season, no difference in PD20 methacholine was found between treatment groups. The results of this study indicate that <tx1_a>fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> is effective in decreasing nasal symptoms and eosinophil inflammation in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis after high-load pollen exposure. Our results also demonstrate that treatment with <tx1_a>fluticasone propionate</tx1_a> partially prevents the increase in bronchial responsiveness provoked by the inhalation of seasonal pollens in allergic rhinitis.

Abstract 26 of 500

A comparative, randomized, double-blind study of <tx1>diclofenac sodium 75 mg im</tx1> versus <tx2>Baralgin (a combination drug composed of dipyrone and two spasmolytics) 5 mL iv</tx2> was performed on <n>57</n> patients with renal colic. Both groups were comparable as to age, sex, pain evolution time before treatment, and no treatment for renal colic in the six hours preceding trial drug administration. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to the evolution of pain after the first dose or in the frequency of administration of a second dose. Tolerability was good in both groups, but sweating and pain throughout the vein were observed in one patient in the <tx2_a>Baralgin</tx2_a> group. We concluded that <tx1_a>diclofenac sodium</tx1_a> constitutes an excellent alternative to pyrazolone analgesics, with the advantages of being monotherapy and having good tolerability, when used as intramuscular injection in ambulatory patients.

Abstract 27 of 500

To assess, using a double-blind procedure, the pain-relieving effects of <tx1_a><tx2_a>rTMS</tx2_a></tx1_a> against <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>, and their predictive value regarding the efficacy of implanted motor cortex stimulation (MCS). Three randomised, double-blinded, 25 min sessions of <tx1>focal rTMS (1 Hz</tx1>, <tx2>20 Hz</tx2> and <tx3>sham</tx3>) were performed in <n>12</n> patients, at 2 weeks intervals. Effects on pain were estimated from daily scores across 5 days before, and 6 days after each session. Analgesic effects were correlated with those of subsequent implanted motor cortex stimulation (MCS). Immediately after the stimulating session, pain scores were similarly decreased by <tx1_a><tx2_a>all rTMS modalities</tx2_a></tx1_a>. Conversely, during the following week, <tx1_a>1 Hz stimulation</tx1_a> provided significantly less analgesia than <tx2_a>20 Hz</tx2_a> and <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>, and was pro-algesic in some patients. <tx3_a>Placebo</tx3_a> and <tx2_a>20 Hz rTMS</tx2_a> were effective on different patients, and only <tx2_a>20 Hz rTMS</tx2_a> predicted the efficacy of subsequent MCS, with no false positives. While <tx1_a>1Hz rTMS</tx1_a> should not be used with analgesic purposes, high-frequency rTMS may become useful to select candidates for MCS. <tx3_a>Placebo</tx3_a> effects are powerful and should be controlled for. Immediate results after a single <tx1_a><tx2_a>rTMS</tx2_a></tx1_a> session are misleading. Defining <tx1_a><tx2_a>rTMS</tx2_a></tx1_a> parameters is a crucial step before proposing <tx1_a><tx2_a>rTMS</tx2_a></tx1_a> as predictive test of SCM efficacy in clinical practice.

Abstract 28 of 500

In thrombotic microangiopathies hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombocytopenic purpura, plasma exchange (PE) therapy using fresh frozen plasma is standard. In almost 20% of the patients, however, this approach is ineffective. This prospective, randomized study for the treatment of patients with thrombotic microangiopathies (PRODROMI) compares <tx1>PE with fresh frozen plasma</tx1> (A) and <tx2>cryosupernatant</tx2> (B). The participating centers were the University Clinics of Freiburg, Hamburg, Düsseldorf, Essen, Göttingen, Mannheim, Ulm, Jena, Tübingen, Würzburg, Kreiskrankenhaus Offenburg, Städt Klinikum Karlsruhe, and Horst-Schmidt Kliniken in Wiesbaden, Germany. Patients (18 to 80 years) were diagnosed by the individual centers based on clinical and laboratory findings (thrombocyte/fragmentocyte count, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, haptoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase levels; negative Coombs-test is obligatory). HIV infection, bone marrow, or solid organ transplantation were exclusion criteria. After written consent, patients were randomized in the A or B group. All patients received 1.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone as a basic therapy. The first PE always was performed with fresh frozen plasma (50 ml/kg). A minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 PEs were required. Thrombocyte count above 150,000/microl was considered to be a successful therapy. Treatment failure was defined as not responding to 10 PE with a thrombocyte count above 150,000/microl or a fall below this value within 30 days after stopping PE. Patients with clinical and laboratory signs of thrombotic microangiopathy occurring later than 30 days after having stopped PE were considered to have a relapse. Primary endpoints were survival, intensity of required PE sessions (duration, volume, and number), and relapse rate. Follow-up of clinical outcome was 2 years; von Willebrand Factor (vWF), vWF-cleaving-protease activity, and Factor H were determined.

Abstract 29 of 500

Early inflammatory lesions and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are characteristics of the respiratory distress in premature neonates and are susceptible to aggravation by assisted ventilation. We hypothesized that treatment with inhaled salbutamol and beclomethasone might be of clinical value in the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in ventilator-dependent premature neonates. The study was double-blinded and placebo controlled. We studied <n>173</n> infants of less than 31 weeks of gestational age, who needed ventilatory support at the 10th postnatal day. They were randomised to four groups and received either <tx1>placebo + placebo</tx1>, <tx2>placebo + salbutamol</tx2>, <tx3>placebo + beclomethasone</tx3> or <tx4>beclomethasone + salbutomol</tx4>, respectively for 28 days. The major criteria for efficacy were: diagnosis of BPD (with score of severity), mortality, duration of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy. The trial groups were similar with respect to age at entry (9.8-10.1 days), gestational age (27.6-27.8 weeks), birth weight and oxygen dependence. We did not observe any significant effect of treatment on survival, diagnosis and severity of BPD, duration of ventilatory support or oxygen therapy. For instance, the odds-ratio (95% confidence interval) for severe or moderate BPD were 1.04 (0.52-2.06) for <tx3_a>inhaled beclomethasone</tx3_a> and 1.54 (0.78-3.05) for <tx2_a>inhaled salbutamol</tx2_a>. This randomised prospective trial does not support the use of treatment with inhaled <tx3_a>beclomethasone</tx3_a>, <tx2_a>salbutamol</tx2_a> or <tx4_a>their combination</tx4_a> in the prevention of BPD in premature ventilated neonates.

Abstract 30 of 500

There are a lot of methods for smoking cessation but <tx1_a>transdermal nicotine system (TNS)</tx1_a> is one of the most popular. On a sample of more than 300 smokers we have formerly shown that <tx1_a>TNS</tx1_a> achieves higher abstinence rate than <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> (38%:21%). In the present study we have tested the optimal administration of <tx1_a>TNS</tx1_a>. <n>160</n> smokers were subdivided in 4 groups of <n1><n2><n3><n4>40</n4></n3></n2></n1>, receiving either <tx1><tx2>TNS</tx2></tx1> or <tx4><tx3>placebo</tx3></tx4>, for <tx1_a><tx3_a>3</tx3_a></tx1_a> or <tx2_a><tx4_a>6</tx4_a></tx2_a> weeks. The abstinence rate was evaluated by appropriate questionnaires and measuring CO in the exhaled air. After 3 weeks of <tx1_a><tx2_a>TNS</tx2_a></tx1_a> 60% of the examinees were abstaining compared to 50% after 6 weeks; the abstinence rates in the <tx4_a><tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a></tx4_a> groups were 17.5% and 20%, respectively (p < 0.05). <tx1_a>Short TNS treatment (3 weeks)</tx1_a> is at least as effective as <tx2_a>a longer one (6 weeks)</tx2_a>, which is relevant both medically and economically.

Abstract 31 of 500

<n>Fifty-two</n> healthy pregnant women were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. After the 26th week of gestation, the women were given either <tx1>1.5 g of elemental calcium per day</tx1> or a <tx2>placebo</tx2>. Subjects in the <tx1_a>calcium</tx1_a> group, after adjustment for race and initial blood pressure (BP), had a term mean systolic and diastolic BP value of 4-5 mmHg lower than those in the placebo group (P less than .05). The incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was 11.1% in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group and 4.0% in the <tx1_a>calcium</tx1_a> group, a nonsignificant difference. Combining these values with previous data, we found a dose-effect relationship between calcium intake and BP reduction during the third trimester of pregnancy. Further research should be directed at understanding the mechanism of this effect and trying to demonstrate a reduction in pregnancy-induced hypertension with calcium supplementation in a larger population.

Abstract 32 of 500

Research suggests that fetal exposure to magnesium sulfate before preterm birth might reduce the risk of cerebral palsy. In this multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned women at imminent risk for delivery between 24 and 31 weeks of gestation to receive magnesium sulfate, administered intravenously as a 6-g bolus followed by a constant infusion of 2 g per hour, or matching placebo. The primary outcome was the composite of stillbirth or infant death by 1 year of corrected age or moderate or severe cerebral palsy at or beyond 2 years of corrected age. A total of 2241 women underwent randomization. The baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. Follow-up was achieved for 95.6% of the children. The rate of the primary outcome was not significantly different in the magnesium sulfate group and the placebo group (11.3% and 11.7%, respectively; relative risk, 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.23). However, in a prespecified secondary analysis, moderate or severe cerebral palsy occurred significantly less frequently in the magnesium sulfate group (1.9% vs. 3.5%; relative risk, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.95). The risk of death did not differ significantly between the groups (9.5% vs. 8.5%; relative risk, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.47). No woman had a life-threatening event. Fetal exposure to magnesium sulfate before anticipated early preterm delivery did not reduce the combined risk of moderate or severe cerebral palsy or death, although the rate of cerebral palsy was reduced among survivors.

Abstract 33 of 500

Chronic pain in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is a difficult problem for which there is no simple method of treatment. Few randomized controlled trials of medications for pain in persons with SCI have been conducted. This study was designed to determine whether <tx1_a>amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant</tx1_a>, is efficacious in relieving chronic pain and improving pain-related physical and psychosocial dysfunction in persons with SCI. <n>Eighty-four</n> participants with SCI and chronic pain were randomized to a 6-week trial of <tx1>amitriptyline</tx1> or <tx2_a>an active placebo, benztropine mesylate</tx2_a>. All pre- and post-treatment assessments were conducted by evaluators blind to the allocation. Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether there was a medication group effect on the primary (average pain intensity) and secondary outcome measures. No significant differences were found between the groups in pain intensity or pain-related disability post-treatment, in either intent-to-treat analyses or analyses of study completers. These findings do not support the use of <tx1_a>amitriptyline</tx1_a> in the treatment of chronic pain in this population, but we cannot rule out the possibility that certain subgroups may benefit.

Abstract 34 of 500

The purpose of this study was to conduct pilot studies for large randomized controlled trials to compare low-molecular-weight heparin with placebo for antenatal thromboprophylaxis (trial 1), and for thromboprophylaxis after cesarean delivery (trial 2). Multicenter randomized controlled trials (trial 1, 23 units; trial 2, 8 units) were conducted. Pregnant women at increased risk for thromboembolic disease were eligible for trial 1; women who underwent cesarean delivery were eligible for trial 2. The interventions were once daily injections of low-molecular-weight heparin or placebo. Primary outcomes were as follows: trial 1, confirmed symptomatic thromboembolic events and symptomatic osteoporotic fractures; trial 2, confirmed symptomatic thromboembolic events and wound complications. Sixteen women were recruited for trial 1; 1 woman in the placebo group had a symptomatic thromboembolic event. One hundred forty-one women were recruited for trial 2; 1 woman in the low molecular weight heparin group had a symptomatic thromboembolic event. Poor recruitment indicates that large-scale trials using these designs would be difficult. Collection of data on the number of women that are eligible and the reasons for nonrecruitment in future trials of these interventions would allow a better understanding of the reasons for poor recruitment.

Abstract 35 of 500

Therapeutic efficacy and safety of <tx1_a>loxapine succinate (LOX)</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>trifluoperazine hydrochloride</tx2_a> were compared by means of a controlled, double-blind study involving <n>49</n> chronic schizophrenic inpatients. The data indicated that <tx1>LOX in dosages ranging from 40 - 65 mg/day, (usually administered on a b.i.d. schedule)</tx1> had demonstrable anti-psychotic activity in 14 of 25 chronic schizophrenic patients (56%), while <tx2>TFP treatment in appropriate dosage</tx2> showed a similar activity in 9 of 23 patients (39%). Both LOX and TFP displayed essentially the same profile and incidence of side effects. Clinical laboratory abnormalities were minor. On the basis of this study, and in comparison with trifluoperazine, it appears that loxapine is an efficacious and essentially safe medication, suitable for the treatment of chronic schizophrenia.

Abstract 36 of 500

To compare the administration of bupivacaine hydrochloride, dexamethasone and lidocaine hydrochloride in decreasing post-tonsillectomy pain. <n>Eighty</n> patients were enrolled in the study in ENT Clinic, Firat University, and in ENT Clinic Elaziğ SSK Hospital, Elaziğ (Turkey). Children between 6 and 14 years of age referred to our department for bilateral tonsillectomy for either recurrent tonsillitis or tonsillar hypertrophy. Data from 80 patients were analyzed. The first group had <tx1>bupivacaine hydrochloride</tx1>. The second group had <tx2>dexamethasone infiltrated around each tonsil</tx2>. The third group was given <tx3>equal doses of 10% lidocain hydrochloride sprayed on the tonsillectomy fossa four times a day</tx3>, and a placebo group received <tx4>9% NaCl applied to the tonsillar fossa four times a day</tx4>. Pain scores, determined by visual analog scale, were obtained in the first, third and seventh postoperative days. Pain scores in the postoperative period were identical in the first, third and seventh postoperative days. According to VAS results the groups were compared on the basis of postoperative pain. In the first postoperative day, the difference between <tx1_a>bupivacaine</tx1_a>-<tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>, <tx2_a>dexamethasone</tx2_a>-<tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> and <tx3_a>lidocaine</tx3_a>-<tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> groups was found to be statistically significant (P<0.05). Nevertheless the difference between <tx1_a>bupivacaine</tx1_a>-<tx2_a>dexamethasone</tx2_a>, <tx1_a>bupivacaine</tx1_a>-<tx3_a>lidocaine</tx3_a> and <tx2_a>dexamethasone</tx2_a>-<tx3_a>lidocaine</tx3_a> were not significant (P>0.05). In the third postoperative day, the difference between <tx1_a>bupivacaine</tx1_a> and <tx3_a>lidocaine</tx3_a> group found to be statistically significant (P<0.05). In the seventh post-operative day the results of <tx1_a>bupivacaine</tx1_a>, <tx2_a>dexamethasone</tx2_a>, <tx3_a>lidocaine</tx3_a> and <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> groups were similar (P>0.05). <tx1_a>Bupivacaine</tx1_a>, <tx2_a>Dexamethasone</tx2_a> and <tx3_a>Lidocaine</tx3_a> nasal aerosol decreased the pain significantly in the first postoperative day when it was compared with the <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> group. These three medicines can be used to reduce pain for children during the postoperative period applied tonsillectomy during the post-operative period. But <tx3_a>lidocaine</tx3_a> was more preferable, reducing pain in the third postop day better than bupivacaine.

Abstract 37 of 500

Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor that reduces blood loss and transfusion requirements when administered prophylactically to cardiac surgical patients. To examine the safety and dose-related efficacy of aprotinin, a prospective, multicenter, <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>-controlled trial was conducted in patients undergoing repeat coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. <n>Two hundred eighty-seven</n> patients were randomly assigned to receive either <tx1>high-dose aprotinin</tx1>, <tx2>low-dose aprotinin</tx2>, <tx3>pump-prime-only aprotinin</tx3>, or <tx4>placebo</tx4>. Drug efficacy was determined by the reduction in donor-blood transfusion up to postoperative day 12 and in postoperative thoracic-drainage volume. The percentage of patients requiring donor-red-blood-cell (RBC) transfusions in the high- and low-dose aprotinin groups was reduced compared with the pump-prime-only and placebo groups (high-dose aprotinin, 54%; low-dose aprotinin, 46%; pump-prime only, 72%; and placebo, 75%; overall P = .001). The number of units of donor RBCs transfused was significantly lower in the aprotinin-treated patients compared with placebo (high-dose aprotinin, 1.6 +/- 0.2 U; low-dose aprotinin, 1.6 +/- 0.3 U; pump-prime-only, 2.5 +/- 0.3 U; and placebo, 3.4 +/- 0.5 U; P = .0001). There was also a significant difference in total blood-product exposures among treatment groups (high-dose aprotinin, 2.2 +/- 0.4 U; low-dose aprotinin, 3.4 +/- 0.9 U; pump-prime-only, 5.1 +/- 0.9 U; placebo, 10.3 +/- 1.4 U). There were no differences among treatment groups for the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI). This study demonstrates that high- and low-dose aprotinin significantly reduces the requirement for donor-blood transfusion in repeat CABG patients without increasing the risk for perioperative MI.

Abstract 38 of 500

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is impingement of the median nerve at the wrist. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of tendon and nerve gliding exercises with standard conservative treatment (SCT), which consists of splinting and local steroid injections, in the treatment of CTS. This study was a prospective, randomized, single-blind trial. Patients were randomized into three groups: treatment with SCT (Group 1); SCT and tendon and nerve gliding exercises (Group 2); tendon and nerve gliding exercises only (Group 3). A symptom total point score was obtained from five symptoms: hand pain, tingling, numbness, nocturnal numbness, and interrupted sleep. The functional status of the hand was determined by assessing seven daily living activities: writing, buttoning clothes, gripping a telephone receiver, opening jars, doing housework, carrying grocery bags, and bathing. Standard physical examinations (Tinel's test, Phalen's test, reverse Phalen's test, and the compression test) were also performed. A total of 111 patients who were diagnosed with intermediate-stage CTS were included in the study. At the end of treatment, significant improvements in symptoms and functionality were detected in all groups. However, the recovery of patients in Groups 1 (n=41) and 2 (n=35) were found to be significantly greater than that of patients in Group 3 (n=35; P<0.001). Patient satisfaction was investigated a mean of 11 months after treatment. Percentages of asymptomatic patients in Group 1 and Group 2 were significantly higher than in Group 3 (P=0.02 and P=0.04, respectively). In the intermediate stage of CTS, SCT was an effective treatment to improve symptoms and functional status. Tendon and nerve gliding exercises alone were inferior to either SCT alone or SCT in combination with gliding exercises.

Abstract 39 of 500

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment of nocturnal enuresis with <tx1>desmopressin intranasal spray</tx1>. <n>Sixty-five</n> children with primary nocturnal enuresis with a mean age of 11.3 years (range 7-17) underwent a 2-week observation period followed by dose titration period of 1 week. Those children completely dry with desmopressin entered a randomized, <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled, double-blind phase lasting 2 weeks, followed by a 6-month open treatment. The enuretic status of the children was documented for 2 weeks after the treatment was stopped. Eleven children had no change from baseline wetting with desmopressin. Thirty-two children receiving 20 mg and 9 children with 40 mg desmopressin were completely dry. Thirteen children were wet 1-2 nights per week, which was better than in the pretreatment period. During the 6-month open-treatment period, the effect of desmopressin was found to be stable. No side effects or adverse reactions were encountered. Two weeks after the treatment was stopped, 25 children were still completely dry (38% of the initial study population, 50% of the responders). The cure rate appeared to continue beyond 18 months after discontinuation of the treatment.

Abstract 40 of 500

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) causes memory impairment and executive function deficits in those with the condition. There is also some evidence that MCI patients are impaired in their daily functioning. Cholinesterase inhibitors have been widely used for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), with evidence of improving cognitive function. There is currently no established treatment for MCI, and cholinesterase inhibitors are beginning to be studied in these patients. <tx1_a>Galantamine</tx1_a> is a cholinesterase inhibitor that also has nicotinic receptor-modulating properties that has been successful in improving AD patients. This study examined the effects of <tx1>galantamine</tx1> in patients with MCI in areas of memory, executive functioning, and global functioning. There was a significant improvement in scores on the Functional Activities Questionnaire, which is a measure of global functioning. There were also improvements in the <tx1_a>galantamine</tx1_a> group on two of six measures in the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychiatric Test Assessment Battery and in immediate free recall on the California Verbal Learning Test.

Abstract 41 of 500

A prospective, randomized study was performed in 559 patients to compare two doses of oral cefadroxil with three doses of intravenous cefuorxime as antibiotic prophylaxis in intra- and subtrochanteric hip fracture surgery. Antibiotic concentrations in the wound fluid were determined at the start and at the end of the operation. The first dose of cefadroxil was given about 2 h before surgery and cefuroxime about 30 min before operation. In 226/242 (93%) patients randomized to oral cefadroxil, the concentration in the wound during surgery was on average 15 micrograms/ml, i.e., well above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC-90) for Staphylococcus aureus. In the cefuroxime group, antibiotic levels in the wound exceeded the MIC-90 for S. aureus in 204/210 (97%) of the patients at the start and/or at the end of surgery. All patients were followed up for 4 months. One deep and five superficial infections occurred in the cefuroxime group and no deep but one superficial infection in the cefadroxil group (P = 0.07). S. aureus was cultured in three of the infected cases while cultures were negative in four patients. Four of the seven infected patients had adequate levels of antibiotic in the wound during surgery, and in three patients no antibiotic assay was performed. The infected patients did not differ in age, sex, operation time, bleeding or any other basic variable compared with patients who healed without complications. Two doses of cefadroxil seems to be practical and as effective as intravenously administered cefuroxime as antibiotic prophylaxis in trochanteric hip fracture surgery.

Abstract 42 of 500

Increasing evidence supports n-3 fatty acid (FA) supplementation for patients with psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the exact metabolic fate of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on different glyceride carriers remains unclear. We investigated whether conjugation of <tx2_a>EPA and DHA to phospholipid (PL-n-3)</tx2_a> or to <tx3_a>triacylglycerol (fish oil; FO)</tx3_a> affects their incorporation in blood compartments and influences executive functioning. Children aged 8-13 y with impaired visual sustained attention performance received <tx1>placebo</tx1>, <tx2>250 mg/d EPA + DHA esterified to PL-n-3 (300 mg/d phosphatidylserine)</tx2>, or <tx3>FO</tx3> for 3 mo in a randomized double-blind manner. Main outcome measures included plasma and erythrocyte FA profile and continuous performance test results (Test of Variables of Attention; TOVA). Sixty of the <n>83</n> children enrolled completed the interventions (n = 18-21 per group). There was an enrichment of EPA (1.5-2.2-fold), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 1.2-fold), and DHA (1.3-fold) in the PL fraction in the plasma of FO- and PL-n-3-fed children. In erythrocytes, only PL-n-3 resulted in a significant reduction (approximately 30%) of very-long-chain saturated FAs (C20-24) and in an increase (1.2- and 2.2-fold, respectively) in linoleic acid and DPA. Total TOVA scores increased in the PL-n-3 (mean +/- SD: 3.35 +/- 1.86) and FO (1.72 +/- 1.67) groups but not in the placebo group (-0.42 +/- 2.51) (PL-n-3 > FO > placebo; P < 0.001). A significant correlation between the alterations in FAs and increased TOVA scores mainly occurred in the PL-n-3 group. Consumption of EPA+DHA esterified to different carriers had different effects on the incorporation of these FAs in blood fractions and on the visual sustained attention performance in children. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00382616.

Abstract 43 of 500

Treatment with thiazolidinediones (TZDs) produces weight gain. To test whether a portion control diet could prevent weight gain during treatment with <tx1_a><tx2_a>pioglitazone</tx2_a></tx1_a> in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This 16-week randomized, open-label, parallel arm study compared three groups: (i) <tx1_a>pioglitazone plus the American Diabetes Association diet (Pio + ADA)</tx1_a>; (ii) <tx2_a>pioglitazone plus a portion control weight loss diet (Pio + PC)</tx2_a>; (iii) <tx3_a>metformin plus the American Diabetes Association diet (Met + ADA)</tx3_a>. All participants received the same advice about calorie reduction, lifestyle change and exercise. <n>Fifty-one</n> men and women with T2DM, naive to TZDs, were randomized to a 16-week study. <tx1_a><tx2_a>Pioglitazone (Pio)</tx2_a></tx1_a> was titrated to a dose of 45 mg/day and <tx3_a>metformin (Met)</tx3_a> to a dose of 2 g/day. Fasting blood was collected for lipids, insulin and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at baseline and 16 weeks. Forty-eight of <n>fifty-one</n> randomized subjects completed the study. Patients treated with <tx1_a>Pio + ADA</tx1_a> gained 2.15 +/- 1.09 kg (mean +/- SD) compared with a weight loss of 2.59 +/- 1.25 kg (p < 0.05) in the <tx2_a>Pio + PC</tx2_a> group, and a weight loss of 3.21 +/- 0.7 kg (p < 0.05) in the <tx3_a>Met + ADA</tx3_a> group. Waist circumference and visceral adipose tissue decreased significantly more in the <tx2_a>Pio + PC</tx2_a> group than in the <tx1_a>Pio + ADA</tx1_a> group. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly increased in the <tx2_a>Pio + PC</tx2_a> group compared with the <tx3_a>Met + ADA</tx3_a> group. <tx1_a><tx2_a>Pioglitazone</tx2_a></tx1_a> reduced insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) more than <tx3_a>metformin</tx3_a>. No significant differences between groups were seen for glucose, insulin, HbA1c or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. <tx2_a>Pio + PC</tx2_a>, prevented weight gain, reduced waist circumference and visceral fat compared with <tx1_a>Pio + ADA</tx1_a> diet.

Abstract 44 of 500

This is a double blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of disulfiram, naltrexone and their combination in patients with co-occurring cocaine and alcohol dependence. 208 patients were randomized to disulfiram (250 mg/day), naltrexone (100 mg/day), the combination, or placebo for 11 weeks. Outcomes were in-trial abstinence from cocaine and/or alcohol. Few safety concerns were reported, although medication adherence was low in a number of patients for both medications, alone or in combination. In the primary analyses (GEE modeling), abstinence from cocaine as measured by cocaine-negative urines and days of self-reported abstinence from cocaine or alcohol did not differ between placebo and any of the medication groups. However, patients taking disulfiram (alone or in combination) were most likely to achieve combined abstinence from cocaine and alcohol. Secondary analyses revealed that patients taking the disulfiram-naltrexone combination were most likely to achieve 3 consecutive weeks of abstinence from cocaine and alcohol. There was an association between disulfiram treatment and abstinence from cocaine and alcohol. More patients taking the disulfiram-naltrexone combination achieved 3 consecutive weeks of abstinence in treatment than placebo-treated patients.

Abstract 45 of 500

Ninety-two eyes with newly-diagnosed chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG) were treated in a randomised prospective trial with either <tx1>timolol</tx1> or <tx2>pilocarpine</tx2>. Their visual field survival was monitored on a 3-monthly basis over 2 years using both Goldmann and Friedmann perimetry. Concomitant tonometric data was derived by applanation. Fields were assessed and quantified using algorithms designed to give the greatest sensitivity for glaucomatous field loss. Microcomputer programmes specifically designed for this purpose were used in the data collection and subsequent analysis.

Abstract 46 of 500

To compare the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine and amitriptyline in controlling chronic painful peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients. A randomized, double-blind, crossover, active-control, clinical trial with variable dose titration was carried out (n = <n>53</n>). <tx1>Amitriptyline orally, at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg at night-time, each dose for 2 weeks</tx1>, and <tx2>lamotrigine orally, at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg twice daily, each dose for 2 weeks</tx2>, by optional titration were used. There was a <tx>placebo washout period</tx> for 2 weeks between the two drugs. Assessment for pain relief, overall improvement and adverse events were carried out. Good, moderate and mild pain relief were noted in 19 (41%), six (13%) and seven (15%) patients on <tx2_a>lamotrigine</tx2_a> and 13 (28%), five (11%) and 15 (33%) patients on <tx1_a>amitriptyline</tx1_a>, respectively, by patient's global assessment of efficacy and safety. Patient and physicians global assessment, McGill pain questionnaire and Likert pain scale showed no significant difference between the treatments, although improvement with both treatments was seen from 2 weeks. Of the 44 adverse events reported, 33 (75%) were with <tx1_a>amitriptyline</tx1_a>, sedation being the commonest [in 19 (43%) patients]. <tx2_a>Lamotrigine</tx2_a> caused adverse events in 11 (25%), of which rash in three (7%) and elevations of creatinine in four (9%) were the most common. The preferred <tx2_a>lamotrigine</tx2_a> dose was 25 mg twice daily. As there are few differences between the two treatments in efficacy, <tx2_a>lamotrigine</tx2_a> 25 mg twice daily might be the first choice as it is associated with fewer adverse effects in our population.

Abstract 48 of 500

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22921 four-arm randomised trial questioned the value of preoperative chemoradiation (XRT-CT) versus preoperative radiation (XRT) and the value of additional postoperative chemotherapy (CT) versus none in T3-T4 M0 resectable rectal cancer patients. We report on the preoperative toxicity, treatment compliance and early deaths (all deaths up to 30 days after surgery) of the two treatment modalities in patients who were entered into trial before January 2001. In the XRT Group (group A), patients received <tx1>45 Gy, 25 fractions over 5 weeks</tx1>. In the XRT-CT Group (group B), <tx2>two 5-day courses of CT were added to the first and fifth weeks of XRT</tx2>. For each CT course: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 350 mg/m2/day and Leucovorin (LV) 20 mg/m2/day were given. <tx1_a>398</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>400</tx2_a> patients started treatment in groups A and B, respectively. Grade 2+acute diarrhoea occurred in 17.3 and 34.3% of patients in groups A and B, respectively (P<0.005). The other side-effects remained unchanged or were only marginally increased. The compliance with RT was 98.5 and 95.5% in groups A and B, respectively. In group B, 78.7 and 71.1% of the patients received 95-105% of the planned CT doses at the first and second courses, respectively. 6 patients died preoperatively, 2 from toxicity in group B. 8 patients (1%) died within the 30 days after surgery in both groups. At the doses recommended in the protocol, the <tx1_a>addition of 5-FU-LV to preoperative XRT</tx1_a> slightly increased the amount of acute toxicity. However, the compliance with the radiation protocol or the feasibility of surgery did not decrease.

Abstract 49 of 500

Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation (LTI) often provoke an undesirable increase in blood pressure (BP) and/or heart rate (HR). We tested the premise that <tx1_a>nicardipine (NIC)</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>esmolol (ESM)</tx2_a> in <tx3_a>combination (COMB)</tx3_a> would oppose both. Adult surgical patients received pretreatment (randomized) with <tx1>IV bolus NIC 30 microg/kg</tx1> (n = <n1>31</n1>), <tx2>ESM 1.0 mg/kg</tx2> (n = <n2>34</n2>), or <tx3>COMB</tx3> (one-half dose each, n = <n3>32</n3>). Peak BP and HR after LTI were compared with controls (CONT; n = 35) with no pretreatment. Anesthetic induction was standardized: IV thiopental (5-7 mg/kg), fentanyl (1-2 microg/kg), and succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg). Systolic (S), diastolic (D), and mean (M) BP and HR awake before pretreatment (baseline) were similar in all test groups. No patient was treated for hypotension, bradycardia, or tachycardia after pretreatment or anesthetic induction. Peak HR after LTI was increased versus baseline in CONT and all test groups, but did not differ from CONT among the test groups. Peak SBP and DBP increased versus baseline in CONT, and with ESM and NIC, but not COMB. Peak SBP, DBP, and MBP were increased with ESM versus COMB, and peak DBP with ESM versus NIC. Compared with no pretreatment before the IV induction of general anesthesia, the peak increase in BP after LTI is best blunted by the combination of nicardipine and ESM, compared with either drug alone. No single drug or combination in the doses tested opposed increased HR. Compared with no pretreatment before the IV induction of general anesthesia, the peak increase in blood pressure after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation is best blunted by the combination of nicardipine and esmolol, compared with either drug alone. No single drug or combination in the doses tested opposed increased heart rate.

Abstract 50 of 500

A total of <n>110</n> children with acute otitis media were assigned randomly to treatment with <tx1>60 mg/kg per day amoxicillin in a twice-daily</tx1> (group A) or <tx2>a thrice-daily</tx2> (group B) regimen for 10 days. Patients were scheduled for follow-up examinations at mid-treatment, 5 days after the end of therapy and 30, 60, 90 days after starting therapy. At 15 days 6 out of <n1>55</n1> patients (10.9%) treated with <tx1_a>amoxicillin twice daily</tx1_a> were considered treatment failures compared to 4 children (7.2%) in the <tx2_a>thrice daily</tx2_a> group. Rates of cure, recurrent otitis media and persistent middle ear effusion were comparable in the two groups of patients at later time intervals. By 90 days the total cure rate was 42.3% (22/52) in children treated <tx1_a>twice daily</tx1_a> and 41.5% (22/53) in those who had received <tx2_a>amoxicillin thrice daily</tx2_a>. At the same time persistence of bilateral and unilateral effusion was noted in 12/52 (23.1%) and 8/52 (15.3%) children in group A and in 16/53 (30.1%) and in 10/53 (18.9%) in group B respectively. No significant difference was noted in the two treatment regimens with regard to adverse side effects. Because reduction in division of the amoxicillin dose caused no significant difference in the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media in infants and children, we think that this simplified scheme of therapy can routinely be used in clinical practice and thus improve compliance to antibiotic administration.

Abstract 51 of 500

We compared concomitant cisplatin and irradiation with radiotherapy alone as adjuvant treatment for stage III or IV head and neck cancer. After undergoing surgery with curative intent, <n2>167</n2> patients were randomly assigned to receive <tx2>radiotherapy alone (66 Gy over a period of 6 1/2 weeks)</tx2> and <n1>167</n1> to receive <tx1>the same radiotherapy regimen combined with 100 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area on days 1, 22, and 43 of the radiotherapy regimen</tx1>. After a median follow-up of 60 months, the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the <tx1_a>combined-therapy</tx1_a> group than in the group given <tx2_a>radiotherapy alone</tx2_a> (P=0.04 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.99), with 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival of 47 percent and 36 percent, respectively. The overall survival rate was also significantly higher in the <tx1_a>combined-therapy</tx1_a> group than in the <tx2_a>radiotherapy</tx2_a> group (P=0.02 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.95), with five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival of 53 percent and 40 percent, respectively. The cumulative incidence of local or regional relapses was significantly lower in the <tx1_a>combined-therapy</tx1_a> group (P=0.007). The estimated five-year cumulative incidence of local or regional relapses (considering death from other causes as a competing risk) was 31 percent after <tx1_a>radiotherapy</tx1_a> and 18 percent after <tx2_a>combined therapy</tx2_a>. Severe (grade 3 or higher) adverse effects were more frequent after <tx2_a>combined therapy</tx2_a> (41 percent) than after <tx1_a>radiotherapy</tx1_a> (21 percent, P=0.001); the types of severe mucosal adverse effects were similar in the two groups, as was the incidence of late adverse effects. Postoperative concurrent administration of <tx1_a>high-dose cisplatin with radiotherapy</tx1_a> is more efficacious than <tx2_a>radiotherapy alone</tx2_a> in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer and does not cause an undue number of late complications.

Abstract 52 of 500

Excessive production of sputum is one of the major symptoms in patients with chronic airway diseases. Because endogenous prostaglandins may play a role in the regulation of airway secretions, blockade of cyclooxygenase pathway with <tx1_a>indomethacin</tx1_a> could decrease respiratory tract fluid and mucus by inhibiting Cl secretion and glandular secretion and by enhancing Na absorption across airway mucosa. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of <tx1_a>inhaled indomethacin</tx1_a> on bronchorrhea in patients with chronic bronchitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, and bronchiectasis in a double-blind, <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled fashion. Patients who inhaled <tx1>2 ml of indomethacin (1.2 micrograms/ml) three times a day for 14 days</tx1> showed a decrease in the amount of sputum, from 189 +/- 19 to 95 +/- 21 g/day (p less than 0.001) and an increase in the solid component of sputum without alterations in parameters of systemic inflammatory responses. Although pulmonary function remained unchanged, perceived dyspnea was improved so that Borg's ratio scale was decreased from 7.1 +/- 0.5 to 4.5 +/- 0.4 (p less than 0.01). Adverse effects, including hypotension and bronchoconstriction, were not observed. The reduction of sputum was accompanied by a significant decrease in the concentrations of prostaglandin (PG)E2, PGF2 alpha, thromboxane B2, and 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha in the sputum. Thus, indomethacin inhalation may be of value in reducing bronchorrhea sputum, probably through the inhibition of PG-dependent airway secretions.

Abstract 53 of 500

The long-term complications of immunosuppressive therapy such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension are a major source of morbidity in liver transplant recipients. In this prospective, randomized, open-label study we completely withdrew prednisone (PRED) 14 days after liver transplantation in an effort to decrease these metabolic complications. Patients were maintained on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in combination with either cyclosporine (CsA; Neoral formulation) or tacrolimus (TAC). Thus, we also were able to compare CsA to TAC in patients not receiving PRED with respect to efficacy, toxicity, and effect on posttransplant metabolic complications. A total of 71 patients were randomized to receive either TAC-MMF (n=35) or CsA-MMF (n=36) after liver transplantation and were analyzed for patient and graft survival. Fifty-eight patients continued the immunosuppressive protocol for at least 6 months after transplantation and were analyzed for the incidence of acute rejection and the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. The 6-month patient survival rates were 94.4% for CsA-MMF and 88.6% for TAC-MMF. Corresponding 6-month graft survival rates were 88.7% and 85.71% with no immunologic graft losses in either group. The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was 46% for CsA-MMF and 42.3% for TAC-MMF. Six patients were converted from CsA to TAC (four for recurrent rejection) and seven patients were converted from TAC to CsA (four for neurotoxicity). Only one patient (in the TAC-MMF group) developed new-onset posttransplant diabetes. In contrast, four of eight patients in the CsA-MMF group who were diabetic before transplant became nondiabetic in the first 3 months after transplant. The mean serum cholesterol level was significantly lower in the TAC-MMF group than in the CsA-MMF group (145.2+/-41.8 mg/dl and 190.3+/-62.2, respectively; P<0.001) and the incidence of hypertension was lower in the TAC-MMF group (12% vs. 30.3% in the CsA-MMF group, P<0.01). Both groups had a lower incidence of metabolic complications compared with a historical group (n=100) maintained on CsA and PRED (10 mg/day at 6 months). MMF in combination with either TAC or CsA allows withdrawal of PRED 14 days after liver transplantation with a moderate rejection rate and no immunologic graft losses. Early PRED withdrawal decreases posttransplant diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, but patients maintained on TAC have lower serum cholesterol levels and a lower incidence of hypertension than CsA-treated patients.

Abstract 54 of 500

Oxygen desaturation and subclinical coronary artery disease may predispose older patients with chronic airflow obstruction to cardiac arrhythmias, especially when high concentrations of theophylline are present in the blood. To assess the safety and efficacy of Uniphyl tablets, an oral theophylline preparation formulated for once-daily dosing, in elderly patients with chronic airflow obstruction, we conducted a randomized, three-phase, double-blind crossover study comparing <tx1>evening dosing with Uniphyl tablets</tx1>, <tx2>Theo-Dur tablets administered twice daily</tx2>, and <tx3>placebo</tx3>. The patients in the study were scheduled to receive each treatment for two weeks. Each day, symptoms, side effects, peak expiratory flow rates, and use of metered-dose inhalers were recorded. Near the end of each phase, serum theophylline concentrations were measured every two hours between 8:00 A.M. and 8:00 P.M. on two consecutive days. The patients underwent ambulatory Holter monitoring during the final 48 hours of each phase. Twelve patients completed the active-drug phases of the study, but seven of the 12 were removed from the placebo phase because of increasing symptom severity. The difference between the number of patients completing the active-drug and placebo phases was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Treatment with <tx1_a>Uniphyl tablets</tx1_a> resulted in a significantly (p less than 0.05) greater increase in peak expiratory flow rate than <tx2_a>Theo-Dur tablet</tx2_a> therapy, and both active drugs increased peak expiratory flow rate more than placebo. Circadian variation in peak expiratory flow rate was seen during the <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a> and <tx2_a>Theo-Dur tablet</tx2_a> phases but not during the <tx1_a>Uniphyl tablet</tx1_a> phase. Symptoms and side effects were similar during the two active-drug phases. Cardiac ectopy was observed in most of the patients, but it was not significantly greater during the <tx1_a><tx2_a>theophylline</tx2_a></tx1_a> phases than during the placebo phase. Furthermore, ectopic activity was not directly related to the times of maximal serum theophylline concentration.

Abstract 55 of 500

<n>Nine</n> obese patients with Type II diabetes mellitus were examined in a double-blind cross-over study. <tx1>Metformin 0.5 g trice daily</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2> were given for 4 weeks. At the end of each period fasting and day-time postprandial values of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and lactate were determined, and in vivo insulin action was assessed using the euglycemic clamp in combination with [3-3H]glucose tracer technique. <tx1_a>Metformin</tx1_a> treatment significantly reduced mean day-time plasma glucose levels (10.2 +/- 1.2 vs 11.4 +/- 1.2 mmol/l, P less than 0.01) without enhancing mean day-time plasma insulin (43 +/- 4 vs 50 +/- 7 mU/l, NS) or C-peptide levels (1.26 +/- 0.12 vs 1.38 +/- 0.18 nmol/l, NS). Fasting plasma lactate was unchanged (1.57 +/- 0.16 vs 1.44 +/- 0.11 mmol/l, NS), whereas mean day-time plasma lactate concentrations were slightly increased (1.78 +/- 0.11 vs 1.38 +/- 0.11 mmol/l, P less than 0.01). The clamp study revealed that <tx1_a>metformin</tx1_a> treatment was associated with an enhanced insulin-mediated glucose utilization (370 +/- 38 vs 313 +/- 33 mg.m-2.min-1, P less than 0.01), whereas insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production was unchanged. Also basal glucose clearance was improved (61.0 +/- 5.8 vs 50.6 +/- 2.8 ml.m-2.min-1, P less than 0.05), whereas basal hepatic glucose production was unchanged (81 +/- 6 vs 77 +/- 4 mg.m-2.min-1, NS). Conclusions: 1) <tx1_a>Metformin</tx1_a> treatment in obese Type II diabetic patients reduces hyperglycemia without changing the insulin secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Abstract 56 of 500

In order to assess the efficacy of a combination of systemic and nebulized corticosteroids in reducing the incidence and severity of chronic lung disease (CLD) in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants, 60 ventilator-dependent infants < or = 1500 g were randomly assigned to receive either steroids or placebo as of 7 d. The steroid group (n = 30, GA = 25.8 +/- 1.6 weeks, BW = 731 +/- 147 g) received systemic dexamethasone for 3 d, followed by nebulized budesonide for 18 d. Control infants (n = 30, GA = 25.9 +/- 1.8 weeks, BW = 796 +/- 199 g) received systemic and inhaled saline. Steroid-treated infants required less ventilatory support between 9 and 17 d (p < 0.01), and had greater lung compliance at 10 d (p = 0.01), but not subsequently. CLD incidence at 36 weeks was 45.5% vs 56.0% in controls, and fewer steroid-treated infants required dexamethasone rescue (23.3% vs 56.7%, p = 0.017). Survival to discharge was similar (73.3% vs 83.3%), as were the durations of mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen use, and hospitalization. Tracheal effluent elastase/albumin ratios and serum cortisol values did not differ between groups, and no adverse effects were noted. We conclude that early dexamethasone administration was associated with improved pulmonary function, which was not sustained with nebulized budesonide. However, the steroid regimen studied reduced the need for dexamethasone rescue in infants with CLD.

Abstract 57 of 500

One hundred and fifty bilateral breast reductions were prospectively randomised intra-operatively to receive a <tx1>unilateral wound drain</tx1>. Seven patients required post-operative evacuation of haematoma, three on the drained and four on the <tx2_a>undrained</tx2_a> sides. There was no statistical difference in haematoma formation between <tx1_a>drained</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>undrained</tx2_a> sides (p = 1), or the incidence of wound healing or other complications. We believe that routine wound drainage in breast reduction surgery is an unnecessary intervention.

Abstract 58 of 500

Oxamniquine proved to be an efficient drug for the treatment of Schistosoma mansoni in adults. The cure rate obtained with a single oral dose of 15 mg/kg was 81.3 per cent. With 15 mg given b.d. for a single day the cure rate was 90 per cent. Post-treatment reduction of egg count was 93.7 and 95 per cent respectively within three months follow-up period. The drug, given by the oral route, was well tolerated, non-toxic, and side-effects were evanescent. Further studies are needed to indicate its use for mass treatment and control of schistosomiasis.

Abstract 59 of 500

Forty-eight patients (13 men and 35 women) took part in a double-blind randomized study. All patients received a placebo daily for 4 weeks (period A), at the end of which the frequency and severity of headaches experienced by each patient were assessed. Patients then received an active drug for 12 weeks (period B). Sixteen patients received nadolol, 80 mg/day; 16 received nadolol, 160 mg/day; and 16 received propranolol, 160 mg/day. The frequency and severity of headaches in the three groups were tabulated at the end of period B, as were the side effects. Only three subjects dropped out during the study, and one of these needed abdominal surgery. All three groups reported improvement, the most noticeable being in those patients who received 80 mg of nadolol daily.

Abstract 60 of 500

The objective of the study was to examine whether patients with schizophrenia who were judged to be stable on long-term treatment with conventional antipsychotic medications would further benefit from a switch to an atypical antipsychotic drug. <n>Thirty-six</n> subjects with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, on conventional antipsychotic medication therapy for at least 2 years, were randomized in double-blind fashion to <tx1_a>risperidone</tx1_a> versus <tx2_a>olanzapine</tx2_a>. Patients were titrated <tx1>up to 6 mg risperidone</tx1> or <tx2>15 mg olanzapine</tx2> as tolerated, followed by tapering and discontinuation of conventional antipsychotic medication. Atypical antipsychotic agents were then administered alone (monotherapy) for 12 weeks. Efficacy and tolerability were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale, and Simpson Angus Scale. Body weight was measured at each visit. Both treatment groups exhibited marked and similar improvement in the total PANSS score from baseline to study endpoint (22 weeks) [<tx1_a>risperidone</tx1_a>: baseline=59.3 (SE 3.1), 22 weeks=44.3 (SE 2.3) (p<0.001); <tx2_a>olanzapine</tx2_a>: baseline=55.9 (SE 3.3), 22 weeks=46.9 (SE 3.2) (p<0.001). Both groups also exhibited significant reductions in PANSS factor scores for positive and negative symptoms and disorganized thoughts. Only <tx1_a>risperidone</tx1_a>-treated patients exhibited significant decreases in uncontrolled hostility/excitement and anxiety and depression. Of note, while positive factor scores exhibited the majority of change within the first 10 weeks, negative factor scores continued to decline significantly in both treatment groups throughout the study. Tolerability assessments did not differ between groups. The results indicate that both atypical antipsychotic medications provided significant additional improvement in symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia previously on conventional antipsychotic agents.

Abstract 61 of 500

The need for <tx1_a>antibiotic treatment</tx1_a> when performing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy may not be as important as it is thought. This study assesses the real efficacy of <tx1_a>antibiotic prophylaxis</tx1_a> in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy with respect to the postoperative infection rate. A prospective randomized study on the routine use of <tx1_a>antibiotic prophylaxis</tx1_a> in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. University teaching hospital, La Sapienza, Italy. <n>Eighty-four</n> patients randomly placed into 2 groups (A [n = <n1>44</n1>] and B [n = <n2>40</n2>]) immediately before undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Before anesthesia was administered, group A received <tx1>intravenously 2 g of cefotaxime sodium diluted in 100 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution</tx1>; group B, <tx2>10 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution in 100 mL of saline</tx2>. A gallbladder bile sample for culture was withdrawn intraoperatively from all patients. In both groups, age, sex, weight, duration of surgery, presence of diabetes, American Society of Anesthesiologists patient classification score, preoperative autologous blood donation, antibiotic administration, intraoperative gallbladder rupture, findings from bile culture positive for bacteria, episodes of colic within 30 days before surgery, length of postoperative hospital stay, and number of septic complications were recorded. All data were correlated by univariate and multivariate analyses with the onset of septic phenomena. In group A, 3 cases of wound infection, 1 case of subhepatic abscess from bile leakage, and 1 case of urinary tract infection were observed; group B, 4 cases of wound infection, 1 case of bronchopneumonia, and 2 cases of urinary tract infection. Comparison of data showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. Findings from bile examination in patients with sepsis complications were positive in 5 patients in group A and in 6 in group B (P = .91). Multivariate analysis showed diabetes mellitus and colic episodes within 30 days before surgery as independent factors significantly associated to the onset of infectious complications. In elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, <tx1_a>antibiotic treatment</tx1_a> did not seem to affect the incidence and severity of infections or the degree of bile contamination.

Abstract 62 of 500

The efficacy of antidepressants as analgesics for a range of chronic pain problems is well documented. However, a controlled trial of an antidepressant for women with chronic pelvic pain has not yet been published. We randomized 23 women from a general gynecology clinic to either double-blind sertraline or placebo. Measures of psychological function, pain, and functional disability were taken at baseline and 6 weeks. After a 2-week washout, the groups were crossed-over and the same measures were done over the next 6 weeks. There were no significant improvements in pain or functional disability noted on sertraline compared to placebo. Studies involving larger samples of patients are needed to confirm these findings.

Abstract 63 of 500

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity was studied in <n>28</n> endogenously depressed, hospitalized patients. Measures of HPA activity obtained were baseline serum cortisol level, 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion, and an overnight 2-mg dexamethasone suppression test. The patients then received double-blind and randomized treatment with <tx1>imipramine hydrochloride, 150 mg daily</tx1>, or <tx2>amitriptyline hydrochloride, 150 mg daily</tx2>, for four weeks. Four-week treatment response of all patients was compared with pretreatment HPA axis variables, and higher cortisol values after dexamethasone administration were found to be significantly correlated with greater improvement. There were no significant differences between <tx1_a>imipramine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>amitriptyline</tx2_a> response, however, when improvement with each drug was compared with the pretreatment HPA variables.

Abstract 64 of 500

Actinic keratoses (AKs) are premalignant skin lesions caused by excessive sun exposure. To explore the therapeutic efficacy of 3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyaluronan gel in the topical treatment of AK. Sixty-four lesions in <n>20</n> patients were evaluated. They were randomized to receive either the active treatment, <tx1>3% diclofenac in 2.5% hyaluronan gel</tx1> or <tx2>placebo, which consisted of the inactive gel vehicle, hyaluronan</tx2> for a period of three months. The collected data were analyzed by using Student t- tests. There was a reduction in the lesion size in 64.7% of <tx1_a>diclofenac</tx1_a>-treated lesions and 34.3% of control lesions during the three-month course of treatment. Only 9.3% of the lesions in the <tx1_a>diclofenac</tx1_a> group were completely cleared during three months of treatment. During the treatment, no significant side-effect was observed in both groups. Considering the malignant potential of actinic keratoses and the importance of clearing them to prevent their transformation to squamous cell carcinoma, the efficacy of <tx1_a>diclofenac gel</tx1_a> seen in our study seems to be low. This treatment may be useful for patients who do not tolerate other, more effective kinds of treatment for actinic keratoses.

Abstract 65 of 500

This study addressed two major questions regarding therapeutic use of Adriamycin ([Adr] Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) in adult soft tissue sarcomas: the influence of dosing schedule and the value of adding imidazole carboxamide (DTIC) to Adr. Patients with objectively measurable metastatic soft tissue sarcomas were randomized to Adr 70 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1 and every 3 weeks (94 patients); Adr 20 mg/m2 IV day 1, 2, and 3, and 15 mg/m2 IV day 8 and weekly thereafter (89 patients); and Adr 60 mg/m2 IV day 1 and DTIC 250 mg/m2 days 1 to 5, repeated every 3 weeks (92 patients). The regimens using Adr as a single agent resulted in an equivalent response frequency (18% and 16%) and survival (median, 8.0 and 8.4 months). DTIC significantly increased (P less than .02) the overall response frequency of Adr to 30%. However, DTIC did not influence survival (median, 8.0 months) or increase the number of complete responses. The toxicities of the two single-agent regimens differed: Adr weekly resulted in more stomatitis (P = .09) and less hematologic toxicity (P less than .05). DTIC resulted in substantially increased toxicity, primarily gastrointestinal (P less than .002); overall, 98% of patients receiving Adr-DTIC experienced moderate or worse toxicity. To decrease the potential for error in interpretation of treatment results, histopathological confirmation of diagnosis was undertaken by a panel of reference pathologists; pathology slides were submitted on 97% of entered patients. The on-study clinical diagnosis was affirmed in 199 of 316 patients (63%) with a final review. In 23% of patients, the panel agreed with the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, but not with the type. In 14%, the panel concluded that a diagnosis of mesenchymal malignancy could not be affirmed. Final treatment results were based on the 275 pathologically confirmed, eligible patients. The most common histological subtype entered was leiomyosarcoma (99 patients). The response to Adr-DTIC of this subtype was higher (44%) than that of any other subtype. However, this difference alone was not responsible for the overall superiority of the combination. This confirmed that the combination of DTIC plus Adr adds to the response rate of Adr alone in soft tissue sarcomas. Whether the increased response frequency, without an impact on survival, is worth the significantly greater toxicity remains a subjective judgement that must be made within the context of the individual patient.

Abstract 66 of 500

Prophylactic zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce diarrhea and respiratory illness in children in many developing countries, but its efficacy in children in Africa is uncertain. To determine if zinc, or zinc plus multiple micronutrients, reduces diarrhea and respiratory disease prevalence. Randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Rural community in South Africa. THREE COHORTS: 32 HIV-infected children; 154 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers; and 187 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-uninfected mothers. Children received either <tx1>1250 IU of vitamin A</tx1>; <tx2>vitamin A and 10 mg of zinc</tx2>; or <tx3>vitamin A, zinc, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, E, and K and copper, iodine, iron, and niacin</tx3> starting at 6 months and continuing to 24 months of age. Homes were visited weekly. Primary outcome was percentage of days of diarrhea per child by study arm within each of the three cohorts. Secondary outcomes were prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms and percentage of children who ever had pneumonia by maternal report, or confirmed by the field worker. Among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers, median percentage of days with diarrhea was 2.3% for 49 children allocated to <tx1_a>vitamin A</tx1_a>; 2.5% in 47 children allocated to receive <tx2_a>vitamin A and zinc</tx2_a>; and 2.2% for 46 children allocated to <tx3_a>multiple micronutrients</tx3_a> (P = 0.852). Among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-uninfected mothers, median percentage of days of diarrhea was 2.4% in 56 children in the <tx1_a>vitamin A</tx1_a> group; 1.8% in 57 children in the <tx2_a>vitamin A and zinc</tx2_a> group; and 2.7% in 52 children in the <tx3_a>multiple micronutrient</tx3_a> group (P = 0.857). Only 32 HIV-infected children were enrolled, and there were no differences between treatment arms in the prevalence of diarrhea. The prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms or incidence of pneumonia did not differ by treatment arms in any of the cohorts. When compared with <tx1_a>vitamin A alone</tx1_a>, <tx2_a>supplementation with zinc</tx2_a>, or with <tx3_a>zinc and multiple micronutrients</tx3_a>, did not reduce diarrhea and respiratory morbidity in rural South African children.

Abstract 67 of 500

This study was designed to evaluate the anxiolytic efficacy of <tx1_a>buspirone</tx1_a> in patients with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) with coexisting mild depressive symptoms. Patients who participated in this multicenter study scored >/= 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and between 12 and 17 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Following a 7- to 10-day placebo lead-in phase, patients who continued to qualify were randomly assigned to receive either <tx1>buspirone titrated from 15 to 45 mg/day</tx1> (N = <n1>80</n1>) or <tx2>placebo</tx2> (N = <n2>82</n2>) for the next 6 weeks. 121 patients completed 6 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy measure was the HAM-A, taken weekly during the study. <tx1_a>Buspirone</tx1_a>-treated patients averaged a 12.4-point reduction from their baseline total HAM-A score of 24.9, while their counterparts on <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> averaged a 9.5-point reduction from their mean baseline total HAM-A score of 25.6. This 2.9-point difference in HAM-A reductions between treatment groups was significantly different (p < .03). <tx1_a>Buspirone</tx1_a> patients decreased their HAM-D scores by an average 5.7 points from their mean baseline total HAM-D score of 15.8, while <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> patients decreased their HAM-D scores by an average 3.5 points from their mean baseline score of 16.3 (p < .05). Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar for both treatment groups, but <tx1_a>buspirone</tx1_a>-treated patients reported significantly more nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and sweating than <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> patients. <tx1_a>Buspirone</tx1_a> is superior to placebo in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in GAD patients who have coexisting depressive symptoms.

Abstract 68 of 500

Diabetic dyslipidemia is featured by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol commonly in the form of small, dense LDL particles. First-line treatment, fibrates versus statins or both, of dyslipidemia in diabetic patients has been the focus of debate. We investigated the potential hypolipidemic effects of atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor with good triglyceride lowering properties, in patients with combined dyslipidemia and evidence of impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes. Twenty patients were recruited for the study, and after a 60-day wash out period, baseline measurements of lipoprotein parameters, LDL particle diameter, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) degradation fragments were obtained. The group was then randomized, in a double-blinded manner, into 2 subgroups. Group A received atorvastatin (80 mg) and group B received placebo daily for 60 days. After the first treatment period, all patients were reanalyzed for the above parameters. The treatment regime then crossed over for the second treatment period in which group A received placebo and group B received atorvastatin (80 mg) daily for 60 days. All parameters were remeasured at the end of the study. Treatment with atorvastatin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol (41%), LDL cholesterol (55%), triglycerides (TG) (32%), and apoB (40%). Mean LDL particle diameter significantly increased from 25.29 +/- 0.24 nm (small, dense LDL subclass) to 26.51 < 0.18 nm (intermediate LDL subclass) after treatment with atorvastatin (n = 20, P <.005). At baseline, LDL particles were predominantly found in the small, dense subclass; atorvastatin treatment resulted in a shift in the profile to the larger and more buoyant LDL subclass. Atorvastatin treatment did not produce consistent changes in the appearance of apoB degradation fragments in plasma. Our results suggest that atorvastatin beneficially alters the atherogenic lipid profile in these patients and significantly decreases the density of LDL particles produced resulting in a shift from small, dense LDL to more buoyant and less atherogenic particles.

A double blind comparison is reported of a new tetracyclic antidepressant, <tx1>maprotiline</tx1>, with <tx2>amitriptyline</tx2> and <tx3>placebo</tx3> in psychiatric outpatients. <tx2_a>Amitriptyline</tx2_a> was significantly more effective than <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a> in its global effect on depression. <tx1_a>Maprotiline</tx1_a> emerged as neither inferior to <tx2_a>amitriptyline</tx2_a> nor superior to <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>. Methodological difficulties prevented an adequate assessment of the anxiolytic activity of maprotiline.

Abstract 70 of 500

Prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in uremia necessitates correction of hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. In order to avoid aluminum toxicity, calcium containing phosphate binders are used increasingly, instead of <tx1_a>aluminium hydroxide</tx1_a>. Recent studies have shown that <tx2_a>calcium acetate</tx2_a> has many characteristics of an ideal phosphate binder. It is, for instance, a more readily soluble salt compared with <tx3_a>calcium carbonate</tx3_a>. This advantage might, however, disappear if calcium carbonate is taken on an empty stomach, a few minutes before meals. We examined the efficacy of three different phosphate binding agents in a randomized prospective study of <n>53</n> patients on regular hemodialysis. Bicarbonate dialyses were performed with a dialysate calcium concentration of 1.75 mmol/l. After a three-week wash-out period, patients received either <tx1>aluminum hydroxide (control group)</tx1>, <tx2>calcium acetate</tx2>, or <tx3>calcium carbonate</tx3> as their phosphate binder. Patients were instructed to take the calcium salts a few minutes before meals on an empty stomach, and aluminum hydroxide during meals. Serum calcium, phosphate, intact parathormone, and alkaline phosphatase levels were determined every month. Patient compliance was estimated every month by asking the patients which phosphate binder and what daily dose they had used. <tx1_a>Aluminum hydroxide</tx1_a> tended to be the most effective phosphate binder. The mean +/- SEM required daily dose of <tx2_a>calcium acetate</tx2_a> at 12 months was 5.04 +/- 0.60 g, corresponding to 10.1 +/- 1.20 tablets of 500 mg. Co-medication with <tx1_a>aluminum hydroxide</tx1_a>, however, was needed (1.29 +/- 0.54 g per day, corresponding to 2.6 +/- 1.08 tablets of 500 mg). The required daily <tx3_a>calcium carbonate</tx3_a> dose appeared to be 2.71 +/- 0.48 g, corresponding to 5.4 +/- 0.95 capsules of 500 mg, with an adjuvant daily <tx1_a>aluminum hydroxide</tx1_a> dose of 0.69 +/- 0.27 g, corresponding to 1.4 +/- 0.55 tablets of 500 mg (p = 0.0055). Thus, the mean daily doses of elemental calcium were comparable between the <tx2_a>calcium acetate</tx2_a> and <tx3_a>calcium carbonate</tx3_a>-treated patients (1.28 +/- 0.15 g versus 1.09 +/- 0.19 g; n.s.). The incidence of hypercalcemic episodes (albumin-corrected serum calcium levels above 2.80 mmol/l) in the calcium acetate-treated group was 18% versus 31% in the calcium carbonate-treated group (p < 0.005). None of the <tx1_a>aluminum hydroxide</tx1_a>-treated patients experienced hypercalcemic episodes. Mean serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, intact parathormone, and aluminum did not differ between the groups. In chronic intermittent hemodialysis patients, per gram administered elemental calcium phosphate binding with either <tx2_a>calcium acetate</tx2_a> or <tx3_a>calcium carbonate</tx3_a> is equivalent, provided that <tx3_a>calcium carbonate</tx3_a> is taken on an empty stomach a few minutes before meals. The number of capsules <tx3_a>calcium carbonate</tx3_a>, but also the total amount in grams, necessary to keep serum phosphate and intact parathormone levels into an acceptable range then is significantly less. This might improve patient compliance.

Abstract 71 of 500

To determine the efficacy of azathioprine in the treatment of Crohn's disease, a 26-week double-blind trial was performed. 20 patients with Crohn's disease, requiring at least 10 mg of prednisone/day over the 3 months prior to entering the study were randomized into placebo (10 patients) and major criterion of success in the trial. There were 7 relapses in the placebo group (5 patients) and 2 relapses in the azathioprine group (2 patients). Complications including fistulae were not affected by the medications. The mean reduction in steriod dosage in the azathioprine group at the end of the trial (-15.5 mg) was greater than in the placebo group (-6.1 mg). These results suggest that azathioprine may permit reduction or discontinuation of steroids without the worsening of symptoms in some patients who appear to require steroids for control of their symptoms. The clinical features of this "AZA-responsive subgroup" remain to be defined.

Abstract 72 of 500

Menopausal hormone therapy has long been credited with many benefits beyond the indications of relieving hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness, and it is often prescribed to treat urinary incontinence (UI). To assess the effects of menopausal hormone therapy on the incidence and severity of symptoms of stress, urge, and mixed UI in healthy postmenopausal women. Women's Health Initiative multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of menopausal hormone therapy in <n>27,347</n> postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years enrolled between 1993 and 1998, for whom UI symptoms were known in 23,296 participants at baseline and 1 year. Women were randomized based on hysterectomy status to active treatment or placebo in either the <tx1_a>estrogen plus progestin (E + P)</tx1_a> or <tx2_a>estrogen alone</tx2_a> trials. The <tx1_a>E + P hormones</tx1_a> were <tx1>0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg/d of medroxyprogesterone acetate (CEE + MPA)</tx1>; <tx2_a>estrogen alone</tx2_a> consisted of <tx2>0.625 mg/d of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE)</tx2>. There were <n1>8506</n1> participants who received <tx1_a>CEE + MPA</tx1_a> (<n2>8102</n2> who received <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>) and <n3>5310</n3> who received <tx3_a>CEE</tx3_a> alone (<n4>5429</n4> who received <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>). Incident UI at 1 year among women without UI at baseline and severity of UI at 1 year among women who had UI at baseline. Menopausal hormone therapy increased the incidence of all types of UI at 1 year among women who were continent at baseline. The risk was highest for stress UI (CEE + MPA: relative risk [RR], 1.87 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.61-2.18]; CEE alone: RR, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.77-2.62]), followed by mixed UI (CEE + MPA: RR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.10-2.01]; CEE alone: RR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.26-2.53]). The combination of <tx1_a>CEE + MPA</tx1_a> had no significant effect on developing urge UI (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99-1.34), but <tx2_a>CEE</tx2_a> alone increased the risk (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58). Among women experiencing UI at baseline, frequency worsened in both trials (<tx1_a>CEE + MPA</tx1_a>: RR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.28-1.49]; <tx3_a>CEE</tx3_a> alone: RR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.35-1.61]). Amount of UI worsened at 1 year in both trials (<tx1_a>CEE + MPA</tx1_a>: RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.06-1.36]; <tx3_a>CEE</tx3_a> alone: RR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.39-1.82]). Women receiving menopausal hormone therapy were more likely to report that UI limited their daily activities (<tx1_a>CEE + MPA</tx1_a>: RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.06-1.32]; <tx3_a>CEE</tx3_a> alone: RR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.15-1.45]) and bothered or disturbed them (<tx1_a>CEE + MPA</tx1_a>: RR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.13-1.32]; <tx3_a>CEE alone</tx3_a>: RR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.37-1.65]) at 1 year. <tx3_a>Conjugated equine estrogen alone</tx3_a> and <tx1_a>CEE + MPA</tx1_a> increased the risk of UI among continent women and worsened the characteristics of UI among symptomatic women after 1 year. Conjugated equine estrogen with or without progestin should not be prescribed for the prevention or relief of UI.

Abstract 73 of 500

The efficacy and safety of <tx1>minocycline</tx1> were compared with that of <tx2>amoxicillin</tx2> in the treatment of <n>58</n> patients with acute bacterial sinusitis. The most frequently isolated pathogens were streptococci, staphylococci, and Haemophilus influenzae. After therapy for a mean time of 11 days, clinical cure or improvement and bacterial eradication were evident in 100% of the patients treated with <tx1_a>minocycline</tx1_a> and in 95% of the patients treated with <tx2_a>amoxicillin</tx2_a>. Roentgenographic results indicated clearing or improvement in 91% of the <tx1_a>minocycline</tx1_a> recipients and in 70% of those who received <tx2_a>amoxicillin</tx2_a>. These differences between treatments were not statistically significant. A low incidence of generally mild adverse clinical experiences occurred in both treatment groups. Thus, <tx1_a>minocycline</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>amoxicillin</tx2_a> were equally safe and effective in the treatment of these patients with acute bacterial sinusitis.

Abstract 74 of 500

To assess the safety and efficacy of 37.5 mg ephedrine i.m. in preventing hypotension associated with spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section. In a double-blind randomised controlled study, 40 patients (20 in each group) were given either 37.5 mg ephedrine or placebo i.m. The following parameters were recorded: (i) blood pressure; (ii) heart rate; (iii) ephedrine i.v. supplementation; (iv) umbilical venous blood gases and neonatal Apgar scores. The incidence of hypertension in the study group was 30% compared with 20% for the control group (P:NS). There was no difference in mean highest blood pressure or mean highest heart rate between the groups. The incidence of hypotension was lower but not significantly lower in the study group (50%) than in the control group (80%) (P:NS). However, the incidence of delayed hypotension was only 10% in the study group patients compared with 50% in the control group patients (P < 0.05). Giving 37.5 mg ephedrine i.m. prior to spinal anaesthesia was not associated with reactive hypertension or tachycardia. Intramuscular ephedrine provided more sustained cardiovascular support than intravenous ephedrine.

Abstract 75 of 500

To compare the analgesic efficacy of <tx1_a>single and multiple doses of ibuprofen</tx1_a> with that of <tx2_a>paracetamol</tx2_a> in patients with knee or hip osteoarthritis (IPSO study). <n>222</n> patients were randomised in a double blind, multicentre study-156 (70%) had a painful knee joint and 66 (30%) a painful hip joint. The main efficacy criterion was pain intensity assessment after a single dose <tx1>(ibuprofen 400 mg</tx1>, <tx2>paracetamol 1000 mg</tx2>). Functional disability assessment and patient global assessment were carried out over 14 days. The sum of the pain intensity difference over 6 hours after the first administration was significantly higher (p = 0.046) in the <tx1_a>ibuprofen</tx1_a> group than in the <tx2_a>paracetamol</tx2_a> group. Over 14 days pain intensity decreased from the first day and was significantly lower in the <tx1_a>ibuprofen</tx1_a> group than in the <tx2_a>paracetamol</tx2_a> group (p<0.05). The functional disability of the patient was assessed using the WOMAC; the <tx1_a>ibuprofen</tx1_a> group improved significantly over 2 weeks compared with the <tx2_a>paracetamol</tx2_a> group for each of the subscales: stiffness (p<0.002), pain (p<0.001), physical function (p<0.002). The drugs were equally safe. The IPSO study shows that for the treatment of osteoarthritic pain, <tx1_a>ibuprofen 400 mg at a single and multiple dose (1200 mg/day) for 14 days</tx1_a> is more effective than <tx2_a>paracetamol, either as a single dose of 1000 mg or a multiple dose (3000 mg/day)</tx2_a>. Because <tx1_a>ibuprofen</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>paracetamol</tx2_a> have similar tolerability, this study indicates that the efficacy/tolerability ratio of <tx1_a>ibuprofen</tx1_a> is better than that of <tx2_a>paracetamol</tx2_a> in this indication over 14 days.

Abstract 77 of 500

To evaluate whether 360 ml of oral clear liquids consumed within 4 hours of elective surgery worsens gastric volume and acidity in patients given acid aspiration prophylaxis. Randomized, unblinded study. Main operating room at a U.S. military hospital. Eighty-three adult inpatients scheduled to receive general anesthesia for elective surgery. Nineteen patients (Group 1) were given 150 mg of oral ranitidine (two doses), 10 mg of metoclopramide, and 360 ml of apple juice 3 hours before the scheduled start of surgery. Thirty-four patients (Group 2) fasted before surgery but received acid aspiration prophylaxis identical to that given to Group 1. Twenty-three additional patients (Group 3) received no oral fluids or acid aspiration prophylaxis before surgery. The residual gastric volume (RGV) and the pH of Group 1 patients were compared with measurements obtained in the two groups of patients who fasted. RGV measurements in Group 1 (14 +/- 3 ml) were similar to those in Group 2 (11 +/- 2 ml) and were significantly less than (p less than 0.05) those in Group 3 (26 +/- 4 ml). Gastric pH was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in Group 1 (5.16 +/- 0.69) and Group 2 (5.78 +/- 0.43) than in Group 3 (1.97 +/- 0.27). Three hundred and sixty ml of apple juice consumed within 4 hours of elective surgery by patients given ranitidine and metoclopramide did not worsen gastric volume and acidity.

Abstract 78 of 500

The Swedish Ticlopidine Multicentre Study (STIMS) was a double-blind <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled trial designed to determine whether <tx1>ticlopidine</tx1>, a platelet antiaggregatory agent, reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke and transitory ischaemic attacks in patients with intermittent claudication. A total of <n>687</n> patients was monitored for a minimum of 5 years or until an end-point was reached. The number of end points (99 vs. 89), analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle, was 11.4% lower in the ticlopidine group (P = 0.24). The mortality rate was 29.1% lower in the <tx1_a>ticlopidine</tx1_a> group (64 vs. 89, P = 0.015); this observation could be accounted for by a reduced mortality from ischaemic heart disease. On-treatment analysis showed there to be significantly fewer end points in the <tx1_a>ticlopidine</tx1_a> group (47 vs. 76, P = 0.017). Diarrhoea was the most common side-effect. Reversible leucopenia or thrombocytopenia was reported in seven patients on <tx1_a>ticlopidine</tx1_a>. It is concluded that the high morbidity and mortality from cardio- and cerebrovascular disease in patients with intermittent claudication can be reduced by long-term treatment with <tx1_a>ticlopidine</tx1_a>.

Abstract 79 of 500

The expected 4-week cure rate after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis are only 65-70%. In an attempt to improve the cure rate by adding probiotic lactobacilli we performed a double-blind <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled study of <tx1_a>adjuvant lactobacilli treatment</tx1_a> after an open treatment with vaginal clindamycin ovules. Women with bacterial vaginosis as defined by Amsel's criteria were treated with clindamycin ovules. Vaginal smears were collected and analysed according to Nugent's criteria. During the following menstruation period the women used, as an adjuvant treatment, either <tx1>lactobacilli-prepared tampons</tx1> or <tx2>placebo tampons</tx2>. The <tx1_a>lactobacilli tampons</tx1_a> were loaded with <tx1_a>a mixture of freeze-dried L. fermentum, L. casei var. rhamnosus and L. gasseri</tx1_a>. The cure rate was recorded after the second menstruation period. There was no improvement in the cure rate after treatment with <tx1_a>lactobacilli-containing tampons</tx1_a> compared to <tx2_a>placebo tampons</tx2_a>; the cure rates as defined by Amsel's criteria were 56% and 62%, respectively, and 55% and 63%, as defined by Nugent's criteria. This is the first study to report cure rates for women with 'intermediate' wet smear ratings according to Nugent's classification and this group had an overall cure rate of 44%. The cure rate of treatment of bacterial vaginosis was not improved by using <tx1_a>lactobacilli-prepared tampons</tx1_a> for one menstruation.

Abstract 80 of 500

To investigate the effects of adjunctive therapy with parenteral N-acetyl-L-cysteine in patients with newly diagnosed septic shock. Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Multidisciplinary intensive care unit at a university teaching hospital. Twenty patients (N-acetyl-L-cysteine group [n = 10], placebo group [n = 10]), 15 male and five female, of mean age 64 +/- 15 (SD) yrs and Acute Physiology and Chronic health Evaluation (APACHE) II score 33 +/- 6, with septic shock within 24 hrs of diagnosis. After a 2-hr stabilization period (time-zero minus 2 hrs to time-zero), patients received either N-acetyl-L-cysteine in 5% dextrose (150 mg/kg in 100 mL over 15 mins, followed by 50 mg/kg in 250 mL over 4 hrs, and then 100 mg/kg/24 hrs in 500 mL for 44 hrs; N-acetyl-L-cysteine group) or the equivalent volume of 5% dextrose (placebo group). Hemodynamic and oxygen transport indices were measured at time-zero minus 2 hrs and time-zero, and at multiple time points thereafter until completion of the trial infusion (time-zero plus 48 hrs). A daily Organ Failure Score was recorded for 14 days. Treatment group demographics and hemodynamic variables did not differ significantly between the two groups at time-zero. Mean (SD), pooled mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cardiac index were 75 +/- 15 mm Hg and 3.9 +/- 1.2 L/min/m2, respectively. Over the next 48 hrs, in the N-acetyl-L-cysteine group, there was a progressive decrease, relative to both time-zero and the placebo group, in MAP, cardiac index, and left ventricular stroke work index (p < .01, repeated-measures analysis of variance). Percentage reductions in these values relative to the placebo group at 48 hrs were 23%, 18%, and 43%, respectively Oxygen transport indices, arterial blood gas analyses, Pao2/Fio2 ratio, and shunt did not differ over time between the groups. There was no difference in either daily Organ Failure Score over time (p > .01, repeated-measures analysis of variance) or hospital mortality rate (90% N-acetyl-L-cysteine group, 50% placebo group) (p > .1, logistic regression) between the two groups. Adjunctive therapy with N-acetyl-L-cysteine in newly diagnosed septic shock was associated with a depression in cardiovascular performance, as indicated by progressive reductions in cardiac index, left ventricular stroke work index, and MAP.

Abstract 81 of 500

In order to investigate the possible stimulating effect of <tx1_a>danazol</tx1_a> on fertility, a randomized clinical trial was performed on 40 women with unexplained infertility. Of these <n>40</n> women, <n1>21</n1> received <tx1>200 mg of danazol daily for 100 days</tx1> and <n2>19</n2> received <tx2_a>a placebo treatment during the same period</tx2_a>. Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, estrone, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were followed before, during, and after treatment. <tx1_a>Danazol</tx1_a> administration induced anovulation in all women, with prompt resumption of normal ovulatory function after discontinuation of the drug. No influence was seen on serum LH, FSH, and testosterone levels, but serum estrone, estradiol, and progesterone levels decreased significantly during treatment. Serum prolactin levels also decreased, but not significantly. No pregnancies occurred in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group during a 6-month follow-up period. In the <tx1_a>danazol</tx1_a> group, five pregnancies occurred, of which two were ectopic and three went to term. The difference in pregnancy rate between both groups was statistically significant (P less than 0.05).

Abstract 82 of 500

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of <tx1_a>escitalopram</tx1_a> in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD, fall-winter depression). <n>Twenty</n> SAD patients were included in an 8-week drug surveillance. Patients were treated with open-label <tx1>escitalopram at a dosage of 10 to 20 mg per day</tx1>. Efficacy assessments included the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SAD version; SIGH-SAD), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Social Adaptation Self Evaluation Scale (SASS). Side effects were monitored with the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale. From week 2 onwards, <tx1_a>escitalopram</tx1_a> significantly reduced SIGH-SAD score and CGI severity score (p<0.001). From week 4 onwards, the SASS score was also significantly improved (p<0.05). The response rate (SIGH-SAD<50% of baseline value) after treatment for 8 weeks was 95%, the rate of remission (SIGH-SAD < or =7) was 85%. Side effects were mild to moderate and did not lead to cessation of therapy. These results suggest that <tx1_a>escitalopram</tx1_a> is an efficacious and altogether safe treatment for seasonal depression.

Abstract 83 of 500

Etanercept and methotrexate are effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but no data exist on concurrent initiation or use of the combination compared with either drug alone. We aimed to assess combination treatment with etanercept and methotrexate versus the monotherapies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In a double-blind, randomised, clinical efficacy, safety, and radiographic study, 686 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly allocated to treatment with etanercept 25 mg (subcutaneously twice a week), oral methotrexate (up to 20 mg every week), or the combination. Clinical response was assessed by criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). The primary efficacy endpoint was the numeric index of the ACR response (ACR-N) area under the curve (AUC) over the first 24 weeks. The primary radiographic endpoint was change from baseline to week 52 in total joint damage and was assessed with the modified Sharp score. Analysis was by intention to treat. Four patients did not receive any drug; thus 682 were studied. ACR-N AUC at 24 weeks was greater for the combination group compared with etanercept alone and methotrexate alone (18.3%-years [95% CI 17.1-19.6] vs 14.7%-years [13.5-16.0], p<0.0001, and 12.2%-years [11.0-13.4], p<0.0001; respectively). The mean difference in ACR-N AUC between combination and methotrexate alone was 6.1 (95% CI 4.5-7.8, p<0.0001) and between etanercept and methotrexate was 2.5 (0.8-4.2, p=0.0034). The combination was more efficacious than methotrexate or etanercept alone in retardation of joint damage (mean total Sharp score -0.54 [95% CI -1.00 to -0.07] vs 2.80 [1.08 to 4.51], p<0.0001, and 0.52 [-0.10 to 1.15], p=0.0006; respectively). The mean difference in total Sharp score between combination and methotrexate alone was -3.34 (95% CI -4.86 to -1.81, p<0.0001) and between etanercept and methotrexate was -27 (-3.81 to -0.74, p=0.0469). The number of patients reporting infections or adverse events was similar in all groups. The combination of etanercept and methotrexate was significantly better in reduction of disease activity, improvement of functional disability, and retardation of radiographic progression compared with methotrexate or etanercept alone. These findings bring us closer to achievement of remission and repair of structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis.

Abstract 84 of 500

<n>Eighty-eight</n> outpatients with postoperative pain after the surgical removal of impacted third molars were randomly assigned, on a double-blind basis, to receive <tx1>a single, oral dose of flurbiprofen 100 mg</tx1>, <tx2>acetaminophen 600 mg</tx2>, <tx3>a combination of acetaminophen 600 mg with codeine 60 mg</tx3>, or <tx4>placebo</tx4>. Using a self-rating record, subjects rated their pain and its relief hourly for 12 hours after medicating. Estimates of sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity differences, total relief, peak relief, and hours of 50% relief were derived from these subjective reports. <tx1_a>Flurbiprofen</tx1_a> and the <tx3_a>acetaminophen-codeine</tx3_a> combination were significantly superior to <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> for every measure of total and peak analgesia and significantly superior to <tx2_a>acetaminophen alone</tx2_a> for most measures of efficacy. Based on the 12-hour data, <tx2_a>acetaminophen alone</tx2_a> did not differ significantly from <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a>; however, it was superior to <tx4_a>placebo</tx4_a> for measures of total effect based on the 4-hour data. <tx1_a>Flurbiprofen</tx1_a> was significantly superior to the <tx3_a>acetaminophen codeine combination</tx3_a> with respect to the number of hours until remedication. All medications had manifested an effect by hour 1; analgesia persisted for 12 hours for <tx1_a>flurbiprofen</tx1_a>, 6 hours for <tx3_a>acetaminophen-codeine</tx3_a>, and 3 hours for <tx2_a>acetaminophen alone</tx2_a>. The frequency of adverse effects was similar for the active medications.

Abstract 85 of 500

After total hip (THR) or knee replacement (TKR), there is still an appreciable risk of developing deep-vein thrombosis despite prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). In a prospective, randomised study we examined the efficacy of <tx_a>LMWH</tx_a> in combination with <tx1_a>intermittent pneumatic compression</tx1_a> in patients undergoing primary unilateral THR or TKR. We administered <tx>40 mg of enoxaparin daily</tx> to 131 patients combined with either the use of <tx1>intermittent pneumatic compression</tx1> or the <tx2>wearing of graduated compression stockings</tx2>. Compression ultrasonography showed no evidence of thrombosis after <tx1_a>LMWH and intermittent pneumatic compression</tx1_a>. In the group with <tx2_a>LMWH and compression stockings</tx2_a> the prevalence of thrombosis was 28.6% (40% after TKR, 14% after THR). This difference was significant (p < 0.0001). In the early post-operative phase after THR and TKR, combined prophylaxis with <tx1_a>LMWH and intermittent pneumatic compression</tx1_a> is more effective than <tx2_a>LMWH used with graduated compression stockings</tx2_a>.

Vitiligo is an acquired depigmenting disease with uncertain aetiopathogenesis, possibly associated with oxidative stress. Narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy (NB-UVB) is the most widely used and effective treatment. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of NB-UVB and the repairing of oxidative stress-induced damage, using oral supplementation with an antioxidant pool (AP). Patients (n = 35) with nonsegmental vitiligo were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre trial. The treatment group received, for 2 months before and for 6 months during the NB-UVB treatment, a balanced AP containing alpha-lipoic acid, vitamins C and E, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The area and number of lesions, as well as some parameters of the oxidation-reduction (redox) status of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were estimated at the beginning, after 2 months, and at the end of the trial. In total, 28 patients completed the study. After 2 months of AP supplementation, the catalase activity and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were 121% and 57% of the basal values (P < 0.05 and P < 0.02 vs. placebo, respectively). The AP increased the therapeutic success of NB-UVB, with 47% of the patients obtaining > 75% repigmentation vs. 18% in the placebo group (P < 0.05). An increase in catalase activity to 114% (P < 0.05 vs. placebo) and decrease in ROS level of up to 60% (P < 0.02 vs. placebo) of the basal value was observed in PBMCs. Finally, the AP intake maintained the membrane lipid ratio (saturated : unsaturated fatty acids 1.8 : 3.1; P < 0.05), counteracting phototherapy-induced saturation. Oral supplementation with AP containing alpha-lipoic acid before and during NB-UVB significantly improves the clinical effectiveness of NB-UVB, reducing vitiligo-associated oxidative stress.

Abstract 88 of 500

A double blind <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled study of two doses of <tx1>gamma-linolenic acid, provided by evening primrose oil (EPO, Epogam, Searle, U.K.)</tx1>, in children with atopic dermatitis was performed: 1) to examine the effect of <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid administration</tx1_a> on the clinical status of children with atopic dermatitis and abnormalities of IgE-mediated immune responses compared to those without such IgE abnormalities; 2) to investigate the effect of <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid</tx1_a> on red cell fatty acid composition and 3) to assess whether treatment with <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid</tx1_a> induced changes in red cell membrane microviscosity. A significant improvement in the overall severity of the clinical condition was seen in children treated with <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid</tx1_a>, independent of whether the children had manifestations of IgE-mediated allergy. Furthermore, <tx1_a>gamma-linolenic acid</tx1_a> treatment increased the percentage content of n-6 fatty acids in erythrocyte cell membrane; this increase was more marked in the membranes of children treated with high doses of <tx1_a>EPO</tx1_a>. In the high dose group a significant increase in dihomogamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) occurred. This may be of particular relevance because of the potential importance of DGLA as a precursor of antiinflammatory prostanoids. Red cell membrane microviscosity did not change in any group after treatment with <tx1_a>EPO</tx1_a>, even in high doses, despite a significant increase in the proportion of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Abstract 89 of 500

Acute steroid-resistant rejection episodes are recommended to be treated with set doses of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3). Individualized T cell monitoring has been proposed as a tool for dose finding. A randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of ATG (n = 27) with OKT3 (n = 28) in the treatment of biopsy verified acute steroid-resistant rejection (ASRR) when both drugs were administered on the basis of daily individualized T cell measurements. A drop to below 50 cells/mm3 CD2+ T cells was considered adequate and used to guide the dose of ATG/OKT3. Demographic, clinical and histopathological severities of rejections were equal in the two groups. During the 10 days of T cell monitoring and antibody treatment, 13 patients were in need of dialysis (ATG = 7/OKT3 = 6). Two grafts did not respond to antibody treatment and were lost due to rejection (ATG = 1/OKT3 = 1). There were 26 biopsy verified re-rejections (ATG = 12/OKT3 = 14) within the first 3 months following antibody treatment. Mean serum creatinine (micromol/L) was similar in the two groups (ATG/OKT3: before rejection 157 +/- 72/151 +/- 88, at start of antibody treatment 308 +/- 125/330 +/- 94, end of antibody treatment 254 +/- 122/246 +/- 144 and at follow-up after a mean of 32 months 166 +/- 55 (n = 24)/164 +/- 57(n = 23)). To keep the T cell count below 50 cells/mm3, average dose ATG given was 354 +/- 151 mg (2.3 administrations, range 1-4) and average OKT3 was 32.5 +/- 6.8 mg in 10 doses. In conclusion, individualized T cell monitored administration of ATG and OKT3 is safe and seems as effective as a standard set dose in treatment of ASRR. Tailoring the dose for each individual patient lowers the cost.

Abstract 90 of 500

In a randomized, double-blinded study with three parallel groups, we assessed the analgesic effect of <tx1_a><tx2_a>intraoperative ketamine administration</tx2_a></tx1_a> in <n>45</n> ASA physical status I or II patients undergoing elective arthroscopic anterior ligament repair under general anesthesia. The patients received either <tx1>IV ketamine 0.15 mg/kg after the induction of anesthesia and before surgical incision and normal saline at the end of surgery (PRE group)</tx1>; <tx2>normal saline after the induction of anesthesia and before surgical incision and IV ketamine at the end of surgery (POST group)</tx2>; or <tx3>normal saline at the beginning and the end of surgery (CONT group)</tx3>. Anesthesia was performed with propofol (2 mg/kg for induction, 60-200 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for maintenance), sufentanil (0.2 microg/kg 10 min after surgical incision, followed by an infusion of 0.25 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) stopped 30 min before skinclosure), vecuronium (0.1 mg/kg), and 60% N2O in O2 via a laryngeal mask airway. Postoperative analgesia was initially provided with IV morphine in the postanesthesia care unit, then with IV patient-controlled analgesia started before discharge from the postanesthesia care unit. Pain scores, morphine consumption, side effects, and degree of knee flexion were recorded over 48 h and during the first and second physiotherapy periods, performed on Days 1 and 2. Patients in the <tx1_a><tx2_a>ketamine</tx2_a></tx1_a> groups required significantly less morphine than those in the CONT group over 48 h postoperatively (CONT group 67.7+/-38.3 mg versus PRE group 34.3+/-23.2 mg and POST group 29.5+/-21.5 mg; P < 0.01). Better first knee flexion (CONT group 35+/-10 degrees versus PRE group 46+/-12 degrees and POST group 47+/-13 degrees; P < 0.05) and lower morphine consumption (CONT group 3.8+/-1.7 mg versus PRE group 1.2+/-0.4 mg and POST group 1.4+/-0.4 mg; P < 0.05) were noted at first knee mobilization. No differences were seen between the PRE and POST groups, except for an increase in morphine demand in the PRE versus the POST group (P < 0.05) in the second hour postoperatively. We found that <tx1_a><tx2_a>intraoperative small-dose ketamine</tx2_a></tx1_a> reduced postoperative morphine requirements and improved mobilization 24 h after arthroscopic anterior ligament repair. No differences were observed in the timing of administration. <tx1_a><tx2_a>Intraoperative small-dose ketamine</tx2_a></tx1_a> may therefore be a useful adjuvant to perioperative analgesic management.

Abstract 91 of 500

A controlled, double-blind investigation was undertaken to determine whether regional anesthesia by dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) could effectively minimize the pain and behavioral disruptions usually associated with newborn circumcision. <n1>Fifteen</n1> infants had <tx1>DPNB with lidocaine</tx1>, <n2>eight</n2> control infants had <tx2>DPNB with saline</tx2>, and <n3>eight</n3> additional control infants were <tx3>circumcised without undergoing DPNB</tx3>. Newborn distress was gauged by subjective observation, measurement of heart rate, and the percent of time spent crying in six sequential timed intervals during circumcision. Ninety-three percent of subjects who received <tx1_a>lidocaine</tx1_a> were observed to have a decrease in agitation after anesthetic administration. The mean increase in heart rate during circumcision was at least 50 percent less in the <tx1_a>lidocaine</tx1_a> injected group than in either control group (p less than 0.01). Infants who had <tx1_a>DPNB with lidocaine</tx1_a> cried 50 percent less during circumcision compared to combined controls (p less than 0.01). <tx1_a><tx2_a>DPNB</tx2_a></tx1_a> was easily administered, and there were no significant complications. Physicians who circumcise newborns have good reason to employ the technique of dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine to minimize infant pain and distress.

Abstract 92 of 500

In a prospective randomized and controlled double-blind trial the effect of prophylactic systemic administration of Cefazolin in elective colorectal surgery on postoperative wound infection was investigated. The incidence of wound infection was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) from 32% in the control group to 10% in the treated group. Furthermore there was a significant reduction (P less than 0.05) in hospital stay of about 3 days.

Abstract 93 of 500

To compare the efficacy of <tx3_a>acupressure wrist bands</tx3_a> and <tx2_a>ondansetron</tx2_a> for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). <n>One hundred and fifty</n> ASA I-II, patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in a randomized, prospective, double-blind and <tx1>placebo</tx1>-controlled study. Patients were divided into three groups of <n1><n2><n3>50</n3></n2></n1>. Group I was the control; Group II received <tx2>ondansetron 4 mg iv just prior to induction of anesthesia</tx2>; in Group III <tx3>acupressure wristbands were applied at the P6 points</tx3>. Acupressure wrist bands were placed inappropriately in Groups I and II. The <tx3_a>acupressure wrist bands</tx3_a> were applied 30 min prior to induction of anesthesia and removed six hours following surgery. Anesthesia was standardized. PONV were evaluated separately as none, mild, moderate or severe within six hours of patients' arrival in the postanesthesia care unit and then at 24 hr after surgery by a blinded observer. If patients vomited more than once, they were given 4 mg ondansetron iv as the rescue antiemetic. Results were analyzed by Z test. A P value of < 0.05 was taken as significant. The incidence of PONV and the requirement of rescue medication were significantly lower in both the <tx3_a>acupressure</tx3_a> and <tx2_a>ondansetron</tx2_a> groups during the first six hours. <tx3_a>Acupressure</tx3_a> at P6 causes a significant reduction in the incidence of PONV and the requirement for rescue medication in the first six hours following laparoscopic cholecystectomy, similar to that of <tx2_a>ondansetron</tx2_a> 4 mg iv.

Abstract 94 of 500

The aim of this work was to compare the efficiency of <tx1>standard intrauterine insemination (IUI)</tx1> and <tx2>Fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP)</tx2> in the treatment of infertility. <n>Ninety-six</n> consecutive patients with infertility in 100 cycles were included in the study. Those randomized to standard IUI included <n1>48</n1> patients in 50 cycles [25 clomiphene citrate only and 25 clomiphene citrate/human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) cycles] (group I). Patients subjected to FSP included <n2>48</n2> patients in 50 cycles (18 clomiphene citrate only and 32 clomiphene citrate/HMG cycles) (group II). The overall pregnancy rate per cycle (16% versus 18%) was not significantly different in the two groups. The pregnancy rates were also similar in the two groups when compared for the cause of infertility: ovulatory disorder 16.7% versus 16%, tubal impairment 10% versus 9.1%, cervical hostility (no pregnancy occurred in this group) and unexplained infertility 21.4 % versus 25 %. The overall pregnancy rate (for the two groups) appeared higher when clomiphene citrate/HMG was used for ovulation induction (21.1%) than when clomiphene citrate only was used (11.6%).

Abstract 95 of 500

In this long-term study, we wanted to explore the effect of dietary supplementation of seal oil (SO) as compared cod-liver oil (CLO) on subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia. The test parameters included fatty acid composition in serum, blood lipids, platelet aggregation, and the activity of blood monocytes. After a run-in period of 6 mon, 120 clinically healthy hypercholesterolemic (7.0-9.5 mmol/L; 270-366 mg/dL) subjects were randomly selected to consume either 15 mL of SO or CLO daily for 14 mon followed by a 4-mon wash-out period. A third group was not given any dietary supplement (control). Consumption of marine oils (SO and CLO) changed the fatty acid composition of serum significantly. Maximal levels were achieved after 10 mon. No further changes were seen after 14 mon. A wash-out period of 4 mon hardly altered the level of n-3 fatty acids in serum. Addition of SO gave 30% higher level of eicosapentaenoic acid, as compared to CLO. Subjects taking SO or CLO had lower whole-blood platelet aggregation than the control group. Neither SO nor CLO had any effects on the levels of serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, postprandial triacylglycerol, apolipoproteins Al and B100, lipoprotein (a), monocyte function expressed as monocyte-derived tissue factor expression, and tumor necrosis factor.

Abstract 96 of 500

Because of its anti-androgenic activity spironolactone 50-200 mg daily is advocated widely for the management of female hirsutism but this practice lacks adequately controlled experimental support. In a double-blind <tx1>placebo</tx1> controlled study of the efficacy of <tx2>spironolactone 100 mg</tx2> daily in idiopathic hirsutism we were unable to demonstrate objective benefit from spironolactone treatment. The mean effect of <tx2_a>spironolactone</tx2_a> given over a 9 month period was to increase hair shaft diameter by +15% with 95% CI (-0.4% to +29%). In addition there were no changes in circulating serum androgen concentrations.

Abstract 97 of 500

Combination antimalarial therapy is advocated to improve treatment efficacy and limit selection of drug-resistant parasites. We compared the efficacies of 3 combination regimens in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso: <tx1>amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1>, which was recently shown to be highly efficacious at this site; <tx2>artemether-lumefantrine</tx2>, the new national first-line antimalarial regimen; and <tx3>dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)</tx3>, a newer regimen. We enrolled <n>559</n> patients >or=6 months of age with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and randomized them to the 3 regimens. We analyzed the risk of recurrent parasitemia by day 28 and day 42, both unadjusted and adjusted by PCR methods to distinguish recrudescence and new infection. Complete data were available for 517 (92.5%) of the enrolled subjects. Early treatment failures occurred in 5 patients treated with <tx1_a>amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1_a> and in 2 patients each treated with the other regimens. The day 28 risk of recurrent parasitemia, unadjusted by genotyping, was significantly higher for patients receiving <tx2_a>artemether-lumefantrine</tx2_a> than for patients receiving <tx1_a>amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1_a> (20.1% vs. 6.2%; risk difference, 13.8%; 95% confidence interval, 7.0%-20.7%) or <tx3_a>dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine</tx3_a> (20.1% vs. 2.2%; risk difference, 17.9%; 95% confidence interval, 11.6%-24.1%). Similar differences were seen for children <5 years of age (54% of the study population) and when outcomes were extended to 42 days. Significant differences were not seen between outcomes for patients receiving <tx1_a>amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1_a> and outcomes for those receiving <tx3_a>dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine</tx3_a>. Recrudescences were uncommon (occurring in <5% of patients) in all treatment groups. No serious adverse events were noted. All regimens were highly efficacious in clearing infection, but considering the risks of recurrent malaria after therapy, the <tx1_a>amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</tx1_a> and <tx3_a>dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine</tx3_a> regimens were more efficacious than the <tx2_a>artemether-lumefantrine</tx2_a> regimen (the new national regimen in Burkina Faso) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.

Abstract 98 of 500

In order to evaluate the contribution of tubal spasm to pelvic pain following laparoscopic sterilisation, we have studied the effect of glycopyrrolate, an anticholinergic agent with antispasmodic properties, on 60 ASA 1 and 2 patients presenting as day-cases for laparoscopic sterilisation using Filshie clips. In a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial, patients received either glycopyrrolate 0.3 mg or saline intravenously prior to induction of anaesthesia. Compared with the control group, patients receiving glycopyrrolate had significantly reduced immediate postoperative pain scores (p < 0.02) and required significantly less postoperative morphine (p < 0.01). Nausea, vomiting and anti-emetic requirements were also reduced though not significantly. We conclude that glycopyrrolate 0.3 mg at induction of anaesthesia is an effective method of improving the quality of recovery after day-case laparoscopic sterilisation using clips.

Abstract 99 of 500

To test the hypothesis that statins improve hyperandrogenemia in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Prospective, randomized trial. Academic medical center. <n>Forty-eight</n> women with PCOS. Subjects were randomized to a <tx1>statin group (simvastatin, 20 mg daily plus oral contraceptive pill [OCP]</tx1>; n = <n1>24</n1>) or an <tx2>OCP group (OCP alone</tx2>; n = <n2>24</n2>). Serum T. Baseline parameters of both groups were comparable. After 12 weeks of treatment, serum T levels declined by 41% in the <tx1_a>statin</tx1_a> group and by 14% in the <tx2_a>OCP</tx2_a> group. In the <tx1_a>statin</tx1_a> group, there was a greater decrease of LH (43% decrease vs. 9% in the <tx2_a>OCP</tx2_a> group) and a greater decline of LH/FSH ratio (44% vs. 12%). In the <tx1_a>statin</tx1_a> group, total cholesterol declined by 10% and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by 24%. In the <tx2_a>OCP</tx2_a> group, total cholesterol increased by 8%, and LDL was unchanged. This is the first study demonstrating that <tx1_a>statin</tx1_a> decreases T levels and normalizes gonadotropin levels in women with PCOS. <tx1_a>Statin</tx1_a> therapy might offer a novel approach, providing endocrine and cardiovascular benefits.

Abstract 100 of 500

Seven 24-hour ECG recordings and blood samples were taken within 3 weeks in <n>42</n> patients who had suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Ca, K and Mg concentrations in serum, and K and Mg in the erythrocytes, were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. One half of the patients were infused with <tx1>81 mval/day MgSO4 for 3 days</tx1>. In patients who exhibited intense electrolyte alterations 10-20 days after AMI, there was a significantly higher rate in the frequency of couplets and/or tachycardia in the 2- to 20-day period after AMI. In patients infused with <tx1_a>MgSO4</tx1_a>, the fluctuation in serum electrolytes and the rate of arrhythmias were significantly reduced.

Abstract 101 of 500

Melasma is a common disorder of cutaneous hyperpigmentation predominantly affecting the faces of women. Little is known about the aetiology of melasma, and treatment is frequently disappointing. Topical tretinoin is of benefit in treating other forms of hyperpigmentation, for example liver spots, and we therefore investigated its effectiveness in melasma. Thirty-eight women completed a randomized, vehicle-controlled study, in which they applied 0.1% tretinoin (n = 19) or vehicle cream (n = 19) once daily to the face for 40 weeks. At the end of treatment 13 (68%) of 19 tretinoin-treated patients were clinically rated as improved or much improved, compared with 1 (5%) of 19 in the vehicle group (P = 0.0006). Significant improvement first occurred after 24 weeks of tretinoin treatment. Colorimetry (an objective measure of skin colour) demonstrated a 0.9 unit lightening of tretinoin-treated melasma and a 0.3 unit darkening with vehicle (P = 0.01); these results correlated with clinical lightening (r = 0.55, P = 0.0005). Histologically, epidermal pigment was reduced 36% following tretinoin treatment, compared with a 50% increase with vehicle (P = 0.002). Reduction in epidermal pigment also correlated with clinical lightening (r = -0.41, P = 0.01). Moderate cutaneous side-effects of erythema and desquamation occurred in 88% of tretinoin-treated and 29% of vehicle-treated patients. Topical 0.1% tretinoin produces significant clinical improvement of melasma, mainly due to reduction in epidermal pigment, but improvement is slow.

To establish the efficacy of <tx1_a><tx2_a>immediate preoperative ototopical ofloxacin eardrops</tx2_a></tx1_a> in eradicating middle ear pathogens and improving operative outcome. Single-blind, randomized control study. Tertiary referral center, ambulatory clinic, and hospital setting. Consecutive patients with chronic suppurative otitis media for Type I tympanoplasty (myringoplasty). The patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups: Group A underwent <tx1>10-minute daily treatments with eardrops for 2 weeks before surgery</tx1>, Group B underwent <tx2>3-minute daily treatments for 2 weeks before surgery</tx2>, and Group C underwent <tx3>no treatment</tx3>. Preoperative and perioperative bacteriology and success of the surgery as defined by an intact tympanic membrane in the eighth week postsurgery. There were <n>101</n> patients entered in the study. The preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative observation of discharge and quantity of the discharge were compared, and no differences were found among the groups (Kruskal-Wallis test). The perioperative culture results were analyzed and 18/21 (86%) became culture negative in Group A, 23/27 (85%) became culture negative in Group B, and 3/21 (14%) became culture negative in the control group (Group C versus Group A or Group B, chi(2) tests p < 0.001). The success rates of surgery as defined by an intact tympanic membrane showed no difference: 28/33 (85%), 27/33 (82%), and 31/35 (89%) in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The preoperative positive bacteriology rate in the surgical failures was 10/15 (67%), compared with 16/76 (21%) for the successful procedures (p < 0.001). Our study has shown that <tx1_a><tx2_a>ofloxacin</tx2_a></tx1_a> successfully eradicates most bacterial flora preoperatively. We cannot, however, confirm the benefits of its preoperative usage in improving the graft success rate.

Abstract 103 of 500

<n>91</n> renal transplant candidates were randomised to receive <tx1>Towne strain cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2> at least 8 weeks before transplantation. The <tx1_a>vaccine</tx1_a> was well tolerated and there was no <tx1_a>vaccine</tx1_a> virus excretion. Serological and cellular immune responses developed in most vaccines but were lower in the transplant patients than in healthy volunteers and some of the seronegative patients failed to mount responses. CMV infection occurred in most of the seronegative <tx1_a>vaccine</tx1_a>-treated or <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-treated patients who received kidneys from seropositive donors, but the illnesses were less severe in the <tx1_a>vaccines</tx1_a> than those in similarly exposed <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-treated patients. <tx1_a>Vaccine</tx1_a>-treated patients who received kidneys from seronegative donors did not excrete virus, and therefore the <tx1_a>vaccine</tx1_a> virus was not reactivated from a putative latent state despite immunosuppression at the time of transplantation.

Abstract 104 of 500

Few reports have addressed the value of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin in treating the full spectrum of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), including recurrent VTE and pulmonary embolism. In an open, multicenter clinical trial, 720 consecutive patients with acute symptomatic VTE, including 119 noncritically ill patients (16.5%) with pulmonary embolism and 102 (14.2%) with recurrent VTE, were randomly assigned to treatment with subcutaneous UFH with dose adjusted by activated partial thromboplastin time by means of a weight-based algorithm (preceded by an intravenous loading dose), or fixed-dose (adjusted only to body weight) subcutaneous nadroparin calcium. Oral anticoagulant therapy was started concomitantly and continued for at least 3 months. We recorded the incidence of major bleeding during the initial heparin treatment and that of recurrent VTE and death during 3 months of follow-up. Fifteen (4.2%) of the 360 patients assigned to UFH had recurrent thromboembolic events, as compared with 14 (3.9%) of the 360 patients assigned to nadroparin (absolute difference between rates, 0.3%; 95% confidence interval, -2.5% to 3.1%). Four patients assigned to UFH (1.1%) and 3 patients assigned to nadroparin (0.8%) had episodes of major bleeding (absolute difference between rates, 0.3%; 95% confidence interval, -1.2% to 1.7%). Overall mortality was 3.3% in each group. Subcutaneous UFH with dose adjusted by activated partial thromboplastin time by means of a weight-based algorithm is as effective and safe as fixed-dose nadroparin for the initial treatment of patients with VTE, including those with pulmonary embolism and recurrent VTE.

Abstract 105 of 500

A randomized comparative study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of <tx1>amoxycillin/clavulanate (Augmentin)</tx1> compared with <tx2>mezlocillin</tx2> for the prevention of wound infection in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. There was no difference in overall wound infection rates between the <tx1_a>amoxycillin/clavulanate</tx1_a> treated group and the <tx2_a>mezlocillin</tx2_a> group. When sub-groups were examined for total infections no significant difference was seen between antibiotic groups in patients undergoing clean/potentially contaminated operations or contaminated operations, although more deep infections were encountered in the <tx1_a>amoxycillin/clavulanate</tx1_a> group in comparison with the <tx2_a>mezlocillin</tx2_a> group, in contaminated operations. The type of operation performed also failed to show any difference in those patients undergoing upper gastro-intestinal, appendiceal, colonic, or biliary operations. The infections in those receiving <tx1_a>amoxycillin/clavulanate</tx1_a> were largely of bowel origin and predominantly sensitive to <tx1_a>amoxycillin/clavulanate</tx1_a>. Those in the <tx2_a>mezlocillin</tx2_a> group were predominantly staphylococcal in origin. <tx1_a>Amoxycillin/clavulanate</tx1_a> appears to be an effective antibiotic for use as a single agent in surgical prophylaxis.

Abstract 107 of 500

To determine the efficacy of Auralgan otic solution (combination product of antipyrine, benzocaine, and glycerin) compared with an olive oil placebo in the management of moderate to severe ear pain in children with acute otitis media (AOM). Children 5 years or older who presented with ear pain and eardrum findings indicative of AOM were randomly assigned to treatment with Auralgan or olive oil drops instilled into the external auditory canal(s) of the affected ear(s). All children were also treated with 15 mg/kg of acetaminophen in a single dose. Ear pain was assessed by means of 2 visual analog seales-a linear scale and a color scale-at study entry and 10, 20, and 30 minutes later (T0, T10, T20, and T30, respectively). Results of the measurements on the 2 scales were evaluated independently and were averaged to determine an ear pain score. A baseline ear pain score of at least 3 points was required for study entry. Four outcome measures regarding ear pain score at T10, T20, and T30 were used: (1) proportion of subjects who showed 50% reduction, (2) proportion of subjects who showed 25% reduction, (3) proportion of subjects who showed a 1 or more point reduction, and (4) mean score over time. Primary care center and emergency department of a children's hospital. Fifty-four children aged 5 to 19 years with ear pain and AOM. The Auralgan and placebo groups were comparable regarding age, sex, race, laterality of AOM, and T0 ear pain score. By each of the 4 measures used, the response to treatment consistently favored the Auralgan group, but only at T30 were any differences statistically significant. In children with AOM-associated ear pain who are treated with acetaminophen, topically applied Auralgan appears likely to provide additional relief in varying degree within 30 minutes.

Abstract 108 of 500

To investigate whether continuous epidural droperidol and intravenous (IV) intraoperative droperidol inhibit pruritus and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) during epidural morphine analgesia. Randomized, double-blinded, controlled study. Metropolitan cancer center. <n>120</n> ASA physical status I and II patients undergoing thoracic or abdominal surgery with general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia. Patients received an intraoperative epidural injection of 2 mg morphine hydrochloride, followed postoperatively by a continuous epidural infusion of morphine hydrochloride 4 mg/day for 4 days. Patients were randomly allocated to four groups: Group A = <tx1>control group</tx1>, Group B = <tx2>intraoperative single IV injection of droperidol (2.5 mg)</tx2>, Group C = <tx3>postoperative continuous epidural droperidol infusion (2.5 mg/day)</tx3>, and Group D = <tx4>intraoperative IV injection of droperidol (2.5 mg) and postoperative continuous epidural droperidol infusion (2.5 mg/day)</tx4>. The frequency and severity of pruritus and PONV in each group were evaluated during the postoperative period. <tx3_a>Continuous epidural infusion of droperidol</tx3_a> significantly reduced the frequency and severity of pruritus and PONV induced by epidural morphine without causing significant side effects. <tx2_a>Intraoperative single IV injection of droperidol</tx2_a> was effective for PONV (p < 0.05) but not for pruritus. <tx2_a>Postoperative epidural droperidol infusion</tx2_a> significantly decreased both the frequency and severity of pruritus and PONV during postoperative continuous epidural morphine analgesia. <tx3_a>IV intraoperative droperidol</tx3_a> significantly reduced the frequency and the severity of PONV but not pruritus.

Abstract 109 of 500

The cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation was investigated in lightly anaesthetised patients admitted to hospital for elective intracranial surgery. One group of patients was given <tx1>fentanyl 5 microgram/kg body weight</tx1> before <tx>induction with thiopentone and suxamethonium</tx>. The other group served as <tx2>controls</tx2>. <tx1_a>Fentanyl</tx1_a> treatment caused a significant attenuation of the blood pressure and pulse response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Different techniques for induction of anaesthesia are discussed in relation to the demands of neuroanaesthesia.

Abstract 110 of 500

Blood haemoglobin concentrations and reticulocyte counts were determined in 430 school children in grades 1, 3 and 5 in a small township in rural Zambia at the end of the rainy season. Running capacity was estimated by the 12-min running test. Age, sex, height, weight, social and nutritional indicators were recorded. Mean haemoglobin was 125.3 g/1 +/- 12.3 SD. Low haemoglobin was associated with indicators of a traditional way of life. After a controlled trial of iron, folic acid, tetrachlorethylene and chloroquine lasting for 6 weeks, mean haemoglobin in all the children was 128.8 g/1 +/- 10.0 SD. The mean haemoglobin was significantly higher in the 218 children who received iron than in the 212 children who did not receive iron. There were no other significant differences among the treatment groups. In a subgroup of 377 children who completed two running tests, those with lower haemoglobin ran significantly shorter distances, even when possible confounding factors were partialled out. The effect was reduced by excluding 12 children with haemoglobin less than 100 g/1 or 48 children with reticulocyte counts of 15% or more, but remained statistically significant.

Abstract 111 of 500

To compare the efficacy of <tx1_a>gentamicin for 5 days plus doxycycline for 8 weeks</tx1_a> with <tx2_a>streptomycin for 2 weeks plus doxycycline for 45 days</tx2_a> in the treatment of human brucellosis. In each arm of the study, <n1><n2>82</n2></n1> patients older than 10 years randomly received <tx1>5 mg/kg gentamicin once daily for 5 days plus 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily for 8 weeks</tx1> or <tx2>1 g of streptomycin intramuscularly for 2 weeks plus the same dose of doxycycline for 45 days</tx2>. Therapeutic failure and relapse in these two treatment groups were compared. This study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (www.irct.ir) with registration number ID: IRCT138708191441N1. The clinical manifestations in these two groups were similar. Therapeutic failure was seen in two (2.4%) patients in the <tx1_a>gentamicin/doxycycline</tx1_a> group and in four (4.9%) patients in the <tx2_a>streptomycin/doxycycline</tx2_a> group [relative risk (RR) = 0.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-2.66, P = 0.68]. Relapse was seen in two (2.4%) cases in the <tx1_a>gentamicin/doxycycline</tx1_a> group and in five (6.1%) cases in the <tx2_a>streptomycin/doxycycline</tx2_a> group (RR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.08-2, P = 0.44). The efficacy with the <tx1_a>gentamicin/doxycycline</tx1_a> regimen was 95.12% and that with the <tx2_a>streptomycin/doxycycline</tx2_a> regimen was 89% (RR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.98-1.17, P = 0.25). Cox regression analyses showed no differences among the two treatment groups for patients who had relapse or therapeutic failure and those who had not regarding baseline covariates such as sex, duration of disease before diagnosis, positive blood culture and focal disease. The results show that the efficacy of <tx1_a>gentamicin for 5 days plus doxycycline for 8 weeks</tx1_a> is not superior to that of <tx2_a>streptomycin for 2 weeks plus doxycycline for 45 days</tx2_a>.

Abstract 112 of 500

The effect of <tx1_a><tx2_a>weekly iron supplementation</tx2_a></tx1_a> with and without <tx1_a><tx2_a>deworming</tx2_a></tx1_a> on hemoglobin was investigated in a double-masked, <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a>-controlled field trial. Subjects were <n>289</n> preschoolers who were randomly divided into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 received <tx1_a><tx2>30 mg Fe once weekly</tx2></tx1_a> and group 3 received a <tx3>placebo</tx3>. Group 1 additionally received <tx1>anthelminthic treatment</tx1>. Supplements were administered by the mothers, who were educated about iron deficiency beforehand. In the <tx1_a><tx2_a>iron-supplemented</tx2_a></tx1_a> groups prevalence of anemia decreased from 37.2% to 16.2% (P < 0.001). Hemoglobin increased by an average of 6.9 +/- 9.8 g/L in the two <tx1_a><tx2_a>iron-supplemented</tx2_a></tx1_a> groups (n = 191), which was greater (P < 0.001) than the increase of 1.9 +/- 8.0 g/L in the <tx3_a>placebo</tx3_a> group. None of the subjects had hookworm, and <tx1_a>anthelminthic</tx1_a> treatment did not have an additional effect. <tx1_a><tx2_a>Iron supplements</tx2_a></tx1_a> administered once weekly by mothers reduced anemia without major involvement of health staff.

Abstract 113 of 500

To determine whether management of incomplete first-trimester abortion with vaginal misoprostol in an under-resourced setting is a viable treatment option. A total of 94 women were randomized to 600 microg of misoprostol intravaginally or to surgical curettage. The women receiving misoprostol were administered a second dose if the abortion was incomplete; and if still not complete after a week, evacuation of retained products of conception was performed. All women had a follow-up visit 2 weeks following complete abortion. The overall success rate of medical management was 91.5%, with 15 of 47 successful cases after 1 dose of misoprostol; 8.5% of the 47 women required evacuation of retained products of conception after 1 week because of treatment failure. The success rate in the surgical arm was 100%. Patients in the medical arm had a longer duration of bleeding and a greater need for analgesia. There were no differences in hemoglobin levels, white blood cell count, adverse effects, pain score, and satisfaction with treatment at the follow-up visit. However, more women who received the medical treatment would recommend it or choose it in the future. Medical management using 600 microg of misoprostol in 2 doses is effective to treat incomplete first-trimester abortions in an under-resourced setting when there is no evidence of uterine sepsis.

Abstract 114 of 500

To determine the preventive and therapeutic effect of <tx1>10 mg of propofol</tx1> administered after delivery on the incidence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV) during intradural anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Controlled, randomized double blind study of <n>60</n> women (ASA I-II) receiving intradural anesthesia for elective or deferred emergency cesarean delivery. The <tx1_a>propofol</tx1_a> group received <tx1_a>10 mg i.v. immediately after fetal extraction</tx1_a>. The control group received an <tx2_a>equal volume of Intralipid</tx2_a>. The presence of IONV after administration of the prophylactic bolus was treated with a second bolus, and if nausea had not subsided completely after two minutes, treatment was topped up with dehydro-benzoperidol. The control group included <n2>31</n2> women and the propofol group <n1>29</n1>, of whom 3 were excluded. Control variables were similar in the two groups. There were no significant differences in the incidence and severity of IONV between the two groups (22.5 versus 23%). The top-up antiemetic drug was used in the same number of patients in each group. Although <tx1_a>10 mg propofol</tx1_a> has been described as an effective direct antiemetic, episodes of IONV were neither prevented nor reversed by its use during intradural anesthesia for cesarean delivery.

Abstract 115 of 500

The present study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of <tx1>clozapine</tx1> versus <tx2>"high-dose" olanzapine</tx2> in treatment-refractory adolescents with schizophrenia. Children, ages 10-18 years, who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and who were resistant or intolerant to at least two antipsychotic drugs were randomized to receive 12 weeks of double-blind flexibly dosed treatment with <tx1_a>clozapine</tx1_a> (n = <n1>18</n1>) or <tx2_a>"high-dose" olanzapine</tx2_a> (up to 30 mg/day) (n = <n2>21</n2>). The primary efficacy measure was response (improvement), defined as a decrease of 30% or more in total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score from baseline and a Clinical Global Impression Scale improvement rating of "1" (very much improved) or "2" (much improved). Significantly more <tx1_a>clozapine</tx1_a>-treated adolescents met response criteria (66%) compared with <tx2_a>olanzapine</tx2_a>-treated subjects (33%). <tx1_a>Clozapine</tx1_a> was superior to <tx2_a>olanzapine</tx2_a> in terms of reduction of the psychosis cluster scores and negative symptoms from baseline to end point. However, both treatments were associated with significant weight-gain and related metabolic abnormalities. This double-blind randomized comparison of two second-generation antipsychotic drugs for treatment-refractory adolescents with schizophrenia supports <tx1_a>clozapine</tx1_a> as the agent of choice. The development of interventions to limit weight gain and metabolic side effects are needed to enhance the risk-benefit profile for both study treatments.

Abstract 116 of 500

We have studied the efficacy of topical Mupirocin for elimination of Staphylococcus aureus (Staph. aureus) nasal carriage in CAPD patients. Staph. aureus nasal carriers in our CAPD program were randomized to one of two groups: Group 1, treated with Mupirocin, and Group 2, treated with neomycin sulphate nasal ointment. The prevalence of Staph. aureus nasal colonization was 44% for patients (24/54) and 17% for dialysis partners (5/29). Group 1 included 11 patients and 1 partner, and Group 2, 8 patients and 2 partners. In Group 1, the eradication rate was 100%, and the recolonization rate was 0, 8, 41, 55 and 66% at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 10 months. In Group 2, the eradication rate was 40%, with a recolonization rate of 0.25 and 75% at 1, 2 and 3 months. Re-treatment with mupirocin was successful in 66% of the cases, compared to 20% for neomycin. The MIC90 of mupirocin for Staph. aureus was 0.5 mcg/mL, with an increase to 4 mcg/mL towards the end of the study. During the study period, there was a very low incidence of Staph. aureus peritonitis or catheter-related infections in patients treated with mupirocin. Secondary effects of mupirocin were negligible. Mupirocin is more effective than neomycin sulphate for the elimination of Staph. aureus nasal colonization in patients undergoing CAPD. Periodic re-treatment is frequently necessary, given the significant recolonization rate.

Abstract 117 of 500

Narrow band UVB is succeeding psoralen and UVA irradiation as the main treatment of vitiligo vulgaris in several European countries. Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency in some vitiligo patients has prompted researchers to investigate the efficacy of these vitamins in the treatment of vitiligo. In the present controlled study we investigated the value of <tx>narrow band UVB phototherapy</tx> in the treatment of vitiligo and the possible additive effect of <tx2_a>vitamin B12 and folic acid</tx2_a>. <n>Twenty-seven</n> patients with long-term stable vitiligo were included and randomized in a <tx1>"UVB only" (UVB)</tx1> or <tx2>"UVB combined with vitamin B12 and folic acid" (UVB+)</tx2> group. Patients were irradiated thrice weekly for one year, whilst repigmentation was carefully monitored. In 92% (25/27) of the patients up to 100% repigmentation was seen. Repigmentation was notable in lesions on the face, neck and throat, lower arm, chest, back and lower legs, whilst repigmentation on the hands, wrists, feet and ankles proved to be minimal. Maximum repigmentation rates did not differ significantly between the <tx1_a>UVB</tx1_a> group and the <tx2_a>UVB+</tx2_a> group. Our study reconfirms that <tx>narrow band UVB phototherapy</tx> is an effective treatment for vitiligo and shows that co-treatment with <tx2_a>vitamin B12 and folic acid</tx2_a> does not improve the outcome of treatment of vitiligo with narrow band UVB phototherapy.

Abstract 118 of 500

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are widely prescribed for children with autism spectrum disorders. To determine the efficacy and safety of <tx1_a>citalopram hydrobromide</tx1_a> therapy for repetitive behavior in children with autism spectrum disorders. National Institutes of Health-sponsored randomized controlled trial. Six academic centers, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of California at Los Angeles, Yale University, and Dartmouth Medical School. <n>One hundred forty-nine</n> volunteers 5 to 17 years old (mean [SD] age, 9.4 [3.1] years) were randomized to receive <tx1_a>citalopram</tx1_a> (n = 73<n1>)</n1> or <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> (n = <n2>76</n2>). Participants had autistic spectrum disorders, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified; had illness severity ratings of at least moderate on the Clinical Global Impressions, Severity of Illness Scale; and scored at least moderate on compulsive behaviors measured with the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. <tx1>Twelve weeks of citalopram hydrobromide (10 mg/5 mL)</tx1> or <tx2>placebo</tx2>. The mean (SD) maximum dosage of <tx1_a>citalopram hydrobromide</tx1_a> was 16.5 (6.5) mg/d by mouth (maximum, 20 mg/d). Positive response was defined by a score of much improved or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale. An important secondary outcome was the score on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders. Adverse events were systematically elicited using the Safety Monitoring Uniform Report Form. There was no significant difference in the rate of positive response on the Clinical Global Impressions, Improvement subscale between the <tx1_a>citalopram</tx1_a>-treated group (32.9%) and the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group (34.2%) (relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.51; P > .99). There was no difference in score reduction on the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scales modified for pervasive developmental disorders from baseline (mean [SD], -2.0 [3.4] points for the <tx1_a>citalopram</tx1_a>-treated group and -1.9 [2.5] points for the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group; P = .81). <tx1_a>Citalopram</tx1_a> use was significantly more likely to be associated with adverse events, particularly increased energy level, impulsiveness, decreased concentration, hyperactivity, stereotypy, diarrhea, insomnia, and dry skin or pruritus. Results of this trial do not support the use of <tx1_a>citalopram</tx1_a> for the treatment of repetitive behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.

Abstract 119 of 500

Thirty adolescents (ages 15-20) who met DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week, fixed-dose (200 mg daily) study of desipramine (DMI). Thirty-three percent of the placebo group and 50 percent of the DMI group improved (greater than or equal to 50% change on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression). Subjective reports of adverse effects did not significantly differentiate the two groups. Major adverse effects, necessitating study discontinuation, occurred solely in the DMI group.

Abstract 120 of 500

To measure the blood flow distribution and regional oxygen transport in hyperdynamic septic shock during hypotension and after correction by vasopressor doses of <tx1>dopamine</tx1> or <tx2>norepinephrine</tx2>. Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Tertiary care center. <n1>Ten</n1> patients with hyperdynamic septic shock (ages ranging from 45.1 +/- 16.6 yrs) and a control group of <n2>11</n2> postoperative cardiac surgery patients (ages ranging from 54.8 +/- 7.9 yrs). Systemic and regional hemodynamics and oxygen transport were measured in ten patients with hyperdynamic septic shock during hypotension and after vasopressor therapy (norepinephrine or dopamine). Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured by indirect calorimetry and splanchnic and leg blood flow with indocyanine green infusion. Splanchnic blood flow and VO2 (p < .05) were increased in septic shock during hypotension and during vasopressor therapy. Both <tx1_a>dopamine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>norepinephrine</tx2_a> increased systemic blood flow and VO2 independently of the arterial lactate level. Despite the relatively small changes in systemic oxygen transport, major regional changes occurred in oxygen delivery and VO2, and these changes were unpredictable from systemic changes. Regional changes in oxygen transport in septic shock cannot be predicted from the changes in the whole body. The increased oxygen demand in the splanchnic region is the main risk factor for splanchnic tissue hypoxia in septic shock.

Abstract 121 of 500

<tx1_a>Topical NSAIDs</tx1_a> have been proven to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) in short-term studies (2 weeks). To justify its chronic use, efficacy of a <tx1_a>topical NSAID</tx1_a> over a longer term of study should be demonstrated. The efficacy and safety of a <tx1_a>topical diclofenac solution</tx1_a> over a 6-week treatment course in symptomatic primary OA of the knee was investigated. <n>216</n> men and women, age 40-85 years, with radiologically confirmed primary OA of the knee and a flare of pain at baseline following discontinuation of prior therapy were enrolled into this double-blind study. Participants applied either a <tx1>topical diclofenac solution (Pennsaid)</tx1> or <tx2>vehicle control solution (carrier with no diclofenac)</tx2>; 40 drops 4 times daily directly to the painful knee(s), without massage, for 6 weeks. Pre-planned primary efficacy outcome measures included the core continuous variables pain relief and improved physical function measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) LK3.1 OA Index, and improved patient global assessment (PGA). Secondary efficacy measure was reduced stiffness. Safety assessments included adverse events and vital signs. The <tx1_a>topical diclofenac</tx1_a> group had a significantly greater mean change in score (final minus baseline) compared to the <tx2_a>vehicle control</tx2_a> group for pain (-5.2 vs. -3.3, p = 0.003), physical function (-13.4 vs. -6.9, p = 0.001), PGA (-1.3 vs. -0.7, p = 0.0001) and stiffness (-1.8 vs. -0.9, p = 0.002). The mean difference between treatment arms (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 1.9 (0.7 to 3.2), 6.5 (2.5 to 10.5), 0.6 (0.2 to 0.9), and 0.9 (0.3 to 1.4), respectively. Safety analyses showed that <tx1_a>topical diclofenac</tx1_a> caused skin irritation, mostly minor local skin dryness, in 42/107 (39%), leading to discontinuation of treatment in 5/107 (5%) participants. This <tx1_a>topical diclofenac</tx1_a> solution demonstrated relief at 6 weeks of the symptoms of primary osteoarthritis of the knee.

Abstract 123 of 500

The 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome' (SIRS) may represent the underlying cause of complications after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This study was conducted to determine whether blocking the etiologic factors of SIRS could improve the complications of BMT. <n>Sixteen</n> consecutive patients with unrelated donors were allocated alternately to two groups. <n1>Seven</n1> patients received <tx1>1.8 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) orally</tx1> from 3 weeks before to about 180 days after transplantation, while <n2>nine</n2> patients did not. These two groups were compared with respect to complications, survival, and various cytokines and factors causing vascular endothelial damage. All <n1>seven</n1> patients receiving <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a> survived and only two had grade III graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Among the <n2>nine</n2> patients <tx2_a>not receiving EPA</tx2_a>, three had grade III or IV GVHD. In addition, thrombotic microangiopathy developed in four patients and cytomegalovirus disease occurred in four. Five patients died in this group. The levels of leukotriene B(4), thromboxane A(2), and prostaglandin I(2) were significantly lower in patients receiving <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a> than in those not receiving it (all P < 0.01). Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-10 were also significantly decreased by <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a> (P < 0.05), as were factors causing vascular endothelial damage such as thrombomodulin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P < 0.05). The survival rate was significantly higher in the group given EPA (P < 0.01). <tx1_a>EPA</tx1_a> significantly reduced the complications of BMT, indicating that these complications may be manifestations of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

Abstract 124 of 500

Improved drug therapy for schizophrenia may represent the best strategy for reducing the costs of schizophrenia and the recurrent chronic course of the disease. <tx1_a>Olanzapine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a> are atypical antipsychotic agents developed to meet this need. We report a multicenter, double-blind, parallel, 30-week study designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and associated resource use for <tx1>olanzapine</tx1> and <tx2>risperidone</tx2> in Australia and New Zealand. The study sample consisted of <n>65</n> patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder. <tx1_a>Olanzapine</tx1_a>-treated patients showed a significantly greater reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total, and PANSS General Psychopathology scores at endpoint compared to the <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a>-treated patients. Response rates through 30 weeks showed a significantly greater proportion of olanzapine-treated patients had achieved a 20% or greater improvement in their PANSS total score compared to risperidone-treated patients. <tx1_a>Olanzapine</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a> were equivalent in their improvement of PANSS positive and negative scores and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) at endpoint. Using generic and disease-specific measures of quality of life, olanzapine-treated patients showed significant within-group improvement in most measures, and significant differences were observed in favor of <tx1_a>olanzapine</tx1_a> over <tx2_a>risperidone</tx2_a> in Quality of Life Scale (QLS) Intrapsychic Foundation and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item instrument (SF-36) Role Functioning Limitations-Emotional subscale scores. Despite the relatively small sample size, our study suggests that olanzapine has a superior risk:benefit profile compared to risperidone.

Abstract 125 of 500

To clarify the effectiveness of amoxicillin prophylaxis in the prevention of catheter-related infections. We performed a randomized, controlled, sequential, prospective trial in newborn infants undergoing percutaneous central venous catheterization. Seventy-five infants (median birth weight, 1240 gm; median age at catheter insertion, 3 days) received prophylactic amoxicillin (100 mg/kg per day); 73 infants in the control group (median birth weight, 1170 gm; median age, 2 days) received no routine prophylactic antibiotic treatment. No infant receiving amoxicillin had septicemia, whereas two infants (2.7%) in the control group did; suspected septicemia (positive clinical and laboratory findings but negative blood culture results) was found in 3 infants in the amoxicillin group and in 6 of the control group (not significantly). Bacterial contamination of the catheter tip at removal was significantly reduced in the amoxicillin group (13.3% vs 28.8% in control subjects; p < 0.05). Negligible differences were found in duration of catheterization (median, 15 days in both groups), or the number of thrombotic (9.3% vs 2.7% in control subjects) and other catheter-related complications between the groups. A low incidence of catheter-related infections can be achieved in neonates with central venous catheters without using prophylaxis with an antibiotic.

We evaluated the efficacy of mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray in decreasing adenoid size and reducing the severity of chronic nasal obstruction symptoms in children affected by adenoidal hypertrophy. <n>Sixty</n> children were recruited in a 2-stage, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. All patients complained of chronic nasal obstruction symptoms, and nasal endoscopy showed >75% choanal obstruction attributable to adenoid pads. In the first stage, 30 patients (group A) underwent <tx1>mometasone treatment (50 microg per nostril per day) for 40 days</tx1>, and 30 children (group B) received <tx2>placebo</tx2>. In the second stage, at the end of the first 40-day treatment period, patients in group A who showed subjective and objective clinical improvement were divided into 2 subgroups; group A1 (11 children) received topical intranasal steroid treatment on alternate days for the first 2 weeks per month, whereas group A2 (10 children) continued daily mometasone treatment for the first 2 weeks per month. After 3 months, all children were reassessed. Fifty-seven children completed the study according to the protocol. After the first treatment period, the severity of symptoms and adenoid size decreased for 21 patients (77.7%) in group A. No improvement was observed in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group. After 3 months of additional therapy, group A2 patients demonstrated a more-pronounced reduction in adenoid size compared with group A1 patients. No statistically significant change in symptoms was identified. Mometasone treatment was well tolerated by all patients. <tx1_a>Mometasone furoate aqueous nasal spray</tx1_a> may be considered useful in decreasing adenoid pad size and the severity of symptoms related to adenoidal hypertrophy. Children with adenoidal hypertrophy that is not associated with tonsillar hypertrophy should be considered for <tx1_a>intranasal mometasone</tx1_a> treatment before surgery is planned.

Abstract 127 of 500

Different mechanical devices have been developed to improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The aim of this study was to evaluate <tx1_a>active compression-decompression (ACD)</tx1_a> CPR applied by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) in a defined population. The Trondheim region EMS (population 154,000) employs simultaneous paramedic and physician response. Upon decision to treat, patients with cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin were allocated to <tx1>ACD CPR (CardioPump)</tx1> or <tx2>standard CPR</tx2> by drawing a random number tag. Outcome in each patient was determined on a 5 point ordinal scale (no clinical improvement = 1, survival to discharge = 5). In 4 years, CPR was attempted in a total of 431 cardiac arrests, 54 patients (13%) survived to discharge; <n>302</n> patients with similar baseline characteristics were randomised. The prevalence of bystander CPR was 57% and the median call-arrival interval 9 min. By intention to treat, the mean score in the <tx2_a>standard CPR</tx2_a> group was 2.51 and 17/145 patients (12%) survived. The mean score in the <tx1_a>ACD CPR</tx1_a> group was 2.53 (P = 0.9) and 20/157 patients (13%) survived. Cerebral outcome was similar in the two groups. Among the 145 <tx1_a>ACD</tx1_a> patients, the technique was successfully applied in 110, found inapplicable in 35 and in seven patients chest compressions were unnecessary. This is the largest, single-centre, randomised, population based study of <tx1_a>ACD CPR</tx1_a> in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to date. Even when considering a wider outcome spectrum than crude survival, we found no evidence of clinical benefit. In a quarter of cases <tx1_a>ACD CPR</tx1_a> was inapplicable, further limiting its potential usefulness.

Abstract 128 of 500

A double-blind, five-week, multicenter trial was conducted to compare the effect of baclofen, a unique amino acid derivative, with that of placebo in the treatment of 106 patients with spasticity secondary to multiple sclerosis. A spasticity assessment method that included a neurological examination, physicians' clinical impressions of changes during treatment, and a patient's self-evaluation was used to determine efficacy. This method showed baclofen (70 to 80 mg daily maximum, titrated) is effective relative to placebo in relieving symptoms of spasticity, such as flexor spasms, pain and stiffness, resistance to passive joint movements, and tendon stretch reflexes. Patient self-evaluation results also showed a significant reduction in clonus. Side effects were generally mild and transient.

Abstract 129 of 500

For psoriasis therapy, topical derivatives of vitamin D3 represent a versatile option: they can be used either alone or in combination with other agents such as topical corticosteroids. In this two-phase parallel-group study, <tx1_a>the naturally occurring vitamin D3 analogue, calcitriol</tx1_a>, was compared with <tx2_a>the vitamin D analogue calcipotrio</tx2_a>l in <n>125</n> patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis. The proposed treatment regimen was an initial bitherapy for 2 or 4 weeks, with <tx>clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream</tx>, a super potent topical corticosteroid applied in the morning and either <tx1>calcitriol 3 mug/g ointment</tx1> or <tx2>calcipotriol 50 mug/g ointment</tx2> applied in the evening, followed by monotherapy with either <tx1_a>calcitriol</tx1_a> or <tx2_a>calcipotriol</tx2_a> applied twice daily until endpoint week 12. Efficacy evaluations (global assessment of improvement, PASI and body surface area (BSA) affected) showed no significant differences between the two regimen groups at the primary endpoints (week 2 and week 12) or at any interim points. At week 2 the investigator's global assessment showed clinical success (psoriasis markedly improved, almost clear or clear) for more than 50% of the patients in both groups and for 48 (79%) and 56 (88%) patients, respectively in the <tx1_a>calcitriol</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>calcipotriol</tx2_a> regimen group at week 12. Least-square means analysis of PASI indicated the <tx1_a>calcitriol</tx1_a> regimen to be equivalent to the <tx2_a>calcipotriol</tx2_a> regimen. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regards to cutaneous safety or to incidence of adverse events. The present study shows that for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis <tx1_a>calcitriol 3 mug/g ointment</tx1_a> can provide a safe and effective alternative to <tx2_a>calcipotriol 50 mug/g ointment</tx2_a> while being administered within a regimen based on a bitherapy with corticosteroids followed by a vitamin D3 maintenance monotherapy.

Abstract 130 of 500

In contrast to the use of opioids for the treatment of acute and chronic cancer pain, the administration of chronic opioid therapy for pain not due to malignancy remains controversial. We describe <n>100</n> patients who were chronically given opioids for treatment of nonmalignant pain. Most patients experienced neuropathic pain or back pain. We used sustained-release <tx1>dihydrocodeine</tx1>, <tx2>buprenorphine</tx2>, and <tx3>sustained-release morphine</tx3>. Pain reduction was measured with visual analogue scales (VAS), and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale was used to assess the patient's function. Good pain relief was obtained in 51 patients and partial pain relief was reported by 28 patients. Only 21 patients had no beneficial effect from opioid therapy. There was a close correlation between the sum and the peak VAS values (r = 0.983; p less than 0.0001) and pain reduction was associated with an increase in performance (p less than 0.0001). The most common side effects were constipation and nausea. There were no cases of respiratory depression or addiction to opioids. Our results indicate that opioids can be effective in chronic nonmalignant pain, with side effects that are comparable to those that complicate the treatment of cancer pain.

Abstract 131 of 500

Eighty three patients with neutropenia and cancer were randomised to receive either 1 g meropenem tds or amikacin 15 mg/kg single dose daily plus ceftazidime 2 g tds. No prophylactic antibiotics were allowed before entry to the trial. Seventy seven patients were available for analysis. Infection was microbiologically or clinically documented in 53 episodes (69%). The overall success rate without adjustment was 49% in monotherapy, 37.5% in the combination group. These rates were increased to 65% and 56%, respectively when secondary infection episodes requiring a different class of chemotherapy were taken into account. Median duration for defervescence was 3 days in successfully treated patients in both groups. Only minor reversible side effects were noted in both treatment arms. Meropenem monotherapy seemed as effective and safe as amikacin plus ceftazidime for the empirical treatment of neutropenic cancer patients with fever.

Abstract 132 of 500

It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Because this issue remains controversial, we studied the incidence of such complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who were randomly assigned to treatment with either the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine or the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor enalapril as part of a larger study. The Appropriate Blood Pressure Control in Diabetes (ABCD) Trial is a prospective, randomized, blinded trial comparing the effects of moderate control of blood pressure (target diastolic pressure, 80 to 89 mm Hg) with those of intensive control of blood pressure (diastolic pressure, 75 mm Hg) on the incidence and progression of complications of diabetes. The study also compared <tx1>nisoldipine</tx1> with <tx2>enalapril</tx2> as a first-line antihypertensive agent in terms of the prevention and progression of complications of diabetes. In the current study, we analyzed data on a secondary end point (the incidence of myocardial infarction) in the subgroup of patients in the ABCD Trial who had hypertension. Analysis of the <n>470</n> patients in the trial who had hypertension (base-line diastolic blood pressure, > or = 90 mm Hg) showed similar control of blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid concentrations, and smoking behavior in the nisoldipine group (<n1>237</n1> patients) and the enalapril group (<n2>233</n2> patients) throughout five years of follow-up. Using a multiple logistic-regression model with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that <tx1_a>nisoldipine</tx1_a> was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (a total of 24) than <tx2_a>enalapril</tx2_a> (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 33.8). In this population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with <tx1_a>the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine</tx1_a> than among those assigned to receive <tx2_a>enalapril</tx2_a>. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation.

Abstract 133 of 500

Using an open randomised controlled study, we examined the effectiveness of manual and electroacupuncture on symptom relief for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee were randomised to one of three treatment groups. Group A had <tx1>acupuncture alone</tx1>, group B had <tx2>acupuncture but continued on their symptomatic medication</tx2>, and group C used their <tx3>symptomatic medication for the first five weeks and then had a course of acupuncture added</tx3>. Patients receiving acupuncture were treated twice weekly over five weeks. Needles were inserted (with manual and electrical stimulation) in acupuncture points for pain and stiffness, selected according to traditional acupuncture theory for treating Bi syndrome. Patients were assessed by a blinded observer before treatment, after five weeks' treatment and at one month follow up, using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario McMaster (WOMAC) questionnaire for osteoarthritis of the knee. The <n>30</n> patients in our study were well matched for age, body mass index, disease duration, baseline VAS pain score and baseline WOMAC scores. Repeated measure analyses gave a highly significant improvement in pain (VAS) after the courses of <tx1_a><tx2_a><tx3_a>acupuncture</tx3_a></tx2_a></tx1_a> in groups A (P = 0.012) and B (P=0.001); there was no change in group C until after the course of <tx1_a><tx2_a><tx3_a>acupuncture</tx3_a></tx2_a></tx1_a>, when the improvement was significant (P = 0.001). Similarly significant changes were seen with the WOMAC pain and stiffness scores. These benefits were maintained during the one month after the course of acupuncture. Patients' rating of global assessment was higher than that of the acupuncturist. We conclude that manual and electroacupuncture causes a significant improvement in the symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee, either on its own or as an adjunct therapy, with no loss of benefit after one month.

Abstract 135 of 500

Our purpose was to determine the effect of <tx1_a>ceftizoxime</tx1_a> in the prolongation of pregnancies receiving tocolysis for preterm labor. A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a>-controlled trial was conducted in patients with preterm labor between 24 and 35 weeks' gestation. A total of <n>545</n> patients with intact membranes and without chorioamnionitis who were receiving magnesium sulfate were screened. Exclusions were for advanced cervical dilatation, penicillin allergy, current antibiotic therapy, and failure to give informed consent. Of these, 117 consecutive, eligible, consenting patients were randomized to receive either <tx1>2 gm of ceftizoxime</tx1> or a <tx2>placebo</tx2> every 8 hours. The primary end point was prolongation of gestation. Statistical comparisons were performed by use of unpaired two-tailed t tests and chi 2 analysis. Of the 58 <tx1_a>ceftizoxime</tx1_a> and 59 <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> patients, there was no difference in the interval to delivery (34.5 +/- 21.1 days vs 34.6 +/- 24.5 days, p = 0.99) and no difference in the rate of delivery before 37 weeks' gestation (60% in the <tx1_a>ceftizoxime</tx1_a> group vs 58% in the <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> group, p = 0.91). Subanalyses of 61 subjects who received nine or more doses and who were group B streptococci negative, 69 patients at < or = 32 weeks on presentation, and 22 sets of twins all showed no differences in delivery interval or rate of delivery at < 37 weeks. The sample size of this study was sufficient to detect a 9-day difference in prolongation of pregnancy (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2). <tx1_a>Ceftizoxime</tx1_a> had no effect on interval to delivery or duration of pregnancy in women treated for preterm labor.

Abstract 136 of 500

A study on induction of labor was carried out to test the hypothesis that changing the cervix will enhance the effectiveness of induction of labor. <n>Fifty</n> pregnant women near term with Bishop scores of 4 or less were divided into 5 study groups, in which a 12-hour preparation phase procedure was carried out to produce cervical or myometrial changes. All women had continuous measurement of uterine activity by an extraovular catheter. The patients were divided into 1) <tx1>control</tx1> subjects, and into groups treated with 2) <tx2>laminaria</tx2>, 3) <tx3>Foley catheter</tx3>, 4) <tx4>amniotomy</tx4>, and 5) oxytocin infusion. These preparation techniques were used for 12 hours, after which rupture of membranes was carried out in all cases. Although all procedures significantly changed the cervix, none but oxytocin affected the induction-to-delivery interval. The authors concluded that when a study design rigidly controls for cervical Bishop score, timing of rupture of membranes, and oxytocin infusion rates, the cervical preparation alone will not enhance inducibility.

Abstract 137 of 500

A double-blind comparative trial of loxapine and trifluoperazine was carried out in 57 acute and chronic schizophrenic patients. In both groups of patients loxapine proved to be equivalent in its effects to trifluoperazine and there were suggestions it might be rather more effective in chronic patients. Side-effects were similar with the two drugs but anticholinergic effects, excitement, dizziness and faintness occurred rather more commonly with loxapine. Laboratory tests, urine analysis, cardiovascular and ophthalmological investigations showed no significant abnormalities.

Abstract 138 of 500

Weight gain is a common adverse effect associated with the use of most antipsychotic drugs. Leptin has been reported to be associated with antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Previous studies have demonstrated a relationship between the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine and serum leptin levels. We planned to comparatively investigate the effects of the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine on leptin and triglyceride levels and weight gain. The study population comprised <n>56</n> patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia, who were divided into 4 treatment groups: <tx1>quetiapine</tx1> (N = <n1>14</n1>), <tx2>olanzapine</tx2> (N = <n2>14</n2>), <tx3>risperidone</tx3> (N = <tx3_a>14</tx3_a>), or <tx4>clozapine</tx4> (N = <n4>14</n4>) monotherapy, and a control group of 11 patients receiving no psychopharmacologic treatment. The patients were evaluated at baseline and at the sixth week according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), body mass index (BMI), weight, and fasting serum leptin and triglyceride levels. Data were gathered in 2001 and 2002. <tx2_a>Olanzapine</tx2_a> and <tx4_a>clozapine</tx4_a> caused a marked increase in weight and serum triglyceride and leptin levels, though increases in these variables were modest in the patients receiving <tx1_a>quetiapine</tx1_a> and minimal in those receiving <tx3_a>risperidone</tx3_a>. There were positive correlations between serum leptin levels and BMI and triglyceride levels. Clinical efficacy, as indicated by decrease in total PANSS scores, was associated with leptin levels in all atypical antipsychotic groups. Our results suggest that leptin may be associated with <tx2_a>olanzapine</tx2_a>- and <tx4_a>clozapine</tx4_a>-induced weight gain and that <tx1_a>quetiapine</tx1_a> appears to have modest influence and <tx3_a>risperidone</tx3_a> appears to have minimal influence on leptin and triglyceride levels and weight gain compared with <tx2_a>olanzapine</tx2_a> and <tx4_a>clozapine</tx4_a>.

Abstract 139 of 500

Smoking cessation has been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials. It is unclear though, whether interventions also work in routine primary care. In 167 primary care settings we conducted a randomized four-armed smoking cessation trial to examine the efficacy of a <tx1>minimal intervention</tx1> (MI; n = <n1>81</n1>), <tx2>cognitive-behavioral therapy</tx2> (CBT; n = <n2>175</n2>), <tx3>bupropion</tx3> (BUP; n = <n3>108</n3>) and <tx4>nicotine replacements</tx4> (NRT; n = <n4>103</n4>). Overall, <n>467</n> current smokers were enrolled. Abstinence rates at the end of treatment (12 weeks) were 32.8% for MI patients, 34.8% for CBT, 35.3% for NRT, and 46.5% for BUP patients (ITT, intention to treat) (no differential effects). Retention rates were highest in the BUP group (59.3%) and lowest in the NRT group (50.5%). Completer findings were: MI, 56.4%; CBT, 64%; BUP, 79.3%; NRT, 69.2% (LOCF, lost to follow-up). No serious adverse events occurred during or after the medication phase. At 12-month follow-up continuous abstinence rates were: BUP, 29.0%; CBT, 20.9%; NRT, 29.6%; MI, 29.6%. Our findings suggest that established smoking cessation treatments are effective when applied by non-specialist primary care physicians. Our data supports a structured, multimodal treatment structure as core ingredient of successful smoking cessation in primary care. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Abstract 140 of 500

Lipid targets can be difficult to attain in familial hypercholesterolaemia. To compare atorvastatin with simvastatin-fenofibrate and simvastatin-cholestyramine therapy, we studied 54 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia over periods of 2-6 months on each therapeutic regimen. The atorvastatin regimen reduced total cholesterol by 41.2 +/- 11.2%, LDL by 45.6 +/- 15.5%, triglycerides by 33.8 +/- 24.8%, and increased HDL by 2.3 +/- 37.0%. Simvastatin-fenofibrate therapy achieved reductions of 33.9 +/- 8.5% in cholesterol, 42.0 +/- 12.2% in LDL, 34.7 +/- 38.3% for triglycerides, and a 25.4 +/- 55.1% increase in HDL. Simvastatin-cholestyramine gave a reduction of 31.3 +/- 11.8% in cholesterol, 36.0 +/- 14.4% in LDL, 13.7 +/- 36.3% in triglycerides, and a 1.1 +/- 30.3% rise in HDL. The atorvastatin regimen was marginally but not significantly better than simvastatin-fenofibrate in improving the LDL:HDL ratio, LDL:apoB and and apolipoprotein B:A1 ratios. Eleven patients (20.4%) had side-effects: two discontinued atorvastatin due to side-effects; two patients had rashes; six had myalgia and two had diarrhoea. Gastrointestinal side-effects were described in 16 (30.1%) patients on simvastatin-cholestyramine therapy and four cases of myalgia (11.2%) were seen with simvastatin-fenofibrate. In nine patients on atorvastatin (20.4%) a 30% or greater fall in HDL was observed, compared to five patients with resin therapy (9.2%) and two with fibrate therapy (5.5%). There were no significant differences in liver or muscle biochemistry between the regimens, but atorvastatin did raise transaminase and creatine kinase concentrations significantly compared to pre-treatment values (p = 0.001). Atorvastatin significantly improves the lipid profile in most patients compared with other regimens. It has a comparable incidence of side-effects to combination therapy regimens.

Abstract 142 of 500

To evaluate risk factors for anal incontinence using an identical twin sisters study design to provide control over genetic variance. A total of 271 identical twin sister pairs (mean age 47 years) completed the validated Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory questionnaire detailing the presence and severity of anal incontinence. Data were analyzed using a stepwise logistic regression with repeated binary measures to account for correlated data within twin pairs. Three different statistical models were used to analyze nonobstetric as well as obstetric risk factors separately. Significant risk factors for anal incontinence and higher Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory anal incontinence subscale scores included age 40 years or older (fecal: odds ratio [OR] 2.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-6.0; flatal: OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.11-3.24), menopause (fecal: OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.15-3.8; flatal: OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.43-3.13), increasing parity (parity > or = 2; fecal: OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.25-7.65; flatal: OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.65-4.51), and the presence of stress urinary incontinence (fecal: OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.12-3.98; flatal: OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.14-2.59). Obesity was associated with significantly higher Colorectal Anal Distress Inventory anal incontinence subscale scores (mean difference 5.18, P = .007). Cesarean delivery after initiation of labor was associated with a lower prevalence of anal incontinence than vaginal birth; however, this difference was not statistically significant (17% compared with 4%, P = .11). No anal incontinence was noted in women who had only elective cesarean deliveries. Age, menopause, obesity, parity, and stress urinary incontinence are the major risk factors for female anal incontinence.

Abstract 143 of 500

Neostigmine, used for reversal of neuromuscular block, has been implicated in the development of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). The use of mivacurium, which does not require neostigmine reversal due to its metabolism by plasma cholinesterase, has made it possible to study the effect of neostigmine on PONV in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled manner. Ninety healthy women scheduled for laparoscopic gynaecological surgery were randomly allocated to two groups in a double-blind manner. One group was given neostigmine (50 microg kg(-1)) and glycopyrrolate (10 microg kg(-1)) (group NG), the other NaCl i.v. as placebo (group P) at the end of surgery when all the patients were spontaneously reversed to at least 75% of full muscle power. The risk of PONV was reduced by using low doses of opioids and ondansetron prophylaxis. All the patients were monitored and assessed for 24 h with regard to pain, nausea, vomiting and overall satisfaction. There was a statistically significant difference (P=0.03) in the occurrence of nausea during the first 6 h postoperatively between NG group (30%) and P group (11%), resulting in the more extensive use of antiemetic drugs in the NG group (28%) than in P group (7%) (P=0.01) in this period. There was no difference between the groups in the frequency of vomiting; seven nauseated patients had vomiting, four in group NG, three in group P. Total number of patients with PONV during the observation period of 24 h, usage of antiemetic rescue medication and overall patient satisfaction did not differ significantly between the groups. The results suggest that antagonism of neuromuscular block with a high dose of neostigmine increases postoperative nausea and the use of antiemetic drugs during the first 6 h after administration.

Abstract 144 of 500

We studied the possible interaction between <tx1_a>rifampin</tx1_a> and <tx2_a><tx1_a>doxycycline</tx1_a></tx2_a> in <n>20</n> patients with brucellosis treated randomly with either <tx1>doxycycline and streptomycin</tx1> or <tx2>doxycycline and rifampin</tx2>. The <tx1_a><tx2_a>doxycycline</tx2_a></tx1_a> levels in the plasma of patients in the group treated with <tx2_a>rifampin</tx2_a> were significantly lower than those in the plasma of patients treated with <tx1_a>doxycycline and streptomycin</tx1_a>. Furthermore, clearance in patients treated with <tx2_a>rifampin</tx2_a> was significantly higher than that in patients treated with <tx1_a>doxycycline and streptomycin</tx1_a>, and consequently, the elimination half-life and the area under the concentration-time curve were significantly lower. There was no therapeutic failure or relapse in the group treated with <tx1_a>doxycycline and streptomycin</tx1_a>, whereas 2 of 10 patients in the group treated with doxycycline and rifampin had a therapeutic failure or relapse. The plasma <tx1_a><tx2_a>doxycycline</tx2_a></tx1_a> levels had an inverse correlation with plasma <tx2_a>rifampin</tx2_a> levels. In the group treated with <tx2_a>rifampin</tx2_a>, those who were rapid acetylators had lower levels of <tx1_a><tx2_a>doxycycline</tx2_a></tx1_a>. In conclusion, combined treatment with <tx2_a>rifampin</tx2_a> reduces the levels of <tx1_a><tx2_a>doxycycline</tx2_a></tx1_a> in plasma. These data suggest that therapeutic failures or relapses may result from this interaction.

Abstract 145 of 500

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of <tx1_a>nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution</tx1_a> and <tx2_a>salbutamol</tx2_a> in the treatment of mild to moderate bronchiolitis. In a randomized controlled trial, <n>93</n> infants with mild to moderate bronchiolitis were divided into two groups. The infants received inhalation of <tx1>2.5 mg (0.5 mL) salbutamol dissolved in either 4.0 mL normal (0.9%) saline</tx1> (control group, n= <n1>43</n1>) or <tx2>4.0 mL hypertonic (3%) saline</tx2> (treatment group, n= <n2>50</n2>). The therapy was repeated three times daily until discharge. Cough, wheezing, pulmonary physical signs, and the length of hospital stay were recorded. Wheezing remission time was 3.8 + or - 1.1 days in the control group and 2.7 + or - 0.9 days in the treatment group (P < 0.01). Cough remission time was 6.3 + or - 0.9 days in the control group and 5.3 + or - 0.8 days in the treatment group (P < 0.01). The moist crackles disappeared at 5.4 + or - 0.8 days in the treatment group versus 6.2 + or - 0.9 days in the control group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the average length of hospital stay decreased from 7.4 + or - 1.5 days in the control group to 6.0 + or - 1.2 days in the treatment group (P < 0.01). No obvious adverse effects were observed. Inhalation of <tx1_a>nebulized 3% hypertonic saline solution and salbutamol</tx1_a> is a safe and effective therapy for patients with mild to moderate bronchiolitis.

Abstract 146 of 500

This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of oral erythromycin treatment in safely prolonging pregnancy among women experiencing preterm premature rupture of membranes. Sixty-five women were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with either erythromycin base or an identical-appearing placebo three times daily for 7 days. Only women between 23 and 34 completed weeks' gestation who did not have an indication for delivery were enrolled in the study. Pretreatment microbiologic tests were obtained and women were followed expectantly. Fifty-five women and their newborns completed the protocol and were fully evaluated. Overall, time from rupture of membranes to onset of labor and to delivery was longer, although not significantly, for erythromycin-treated women. Similarly, there was a trend for reduced neonatal intensive care (level II, p = 0.07). When gestational age at enrollment was controlled, erythromycin treatment of women between 28 to 32 weeks' gestation was associated with a prolonged interval from enrollment to delivery [erythromycin: 292 hours (5 to 679); placebo: 54 (12 to 323); p less than 0.044]. Fifty percent of erythromycin-treated women between 28 to 32 weeks' gestation continued their pregnancies at least 13 days after premature rupture of membranes, whereas 50% of placebo-treated women were delivered of infants within 4 days (p = 0.02). Erythromycin treatment among women less than 28 and between 33 to 34 weeks' gestation was not associated with prolonged latency or other changes. There were no differences between erythromycin- and placebo-treated women in the occurrence of clinically recognized chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis, or neonatal infectious morbidity. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, erythromycin treatment was well tolerated, safe, and associated with prolongation of pregnancy and reduced intensive neonatal care requirements for selected mother-newborn pairs with preterm premature rupture of membranes.

To assess the effectiveness of low-intensity laser therapy in the treatment of musculoskeletal low back pain. A double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. A physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic. <n>Sixty-three</n> ambulatory men and women between the ages of 18 and 70yrs with symptomatic nonradiating low back pain of more than 30 days' duration and normal neurologic examination results. Subjects were bloc randomized into two groups with a computer-generated schedule. All underwent <tx>irradiation for 90 seconds at eight symmetric points along the lumbosacral spine three times a week for 4 weeks by a masked therapist</tx>. The sole difference between the groups was that <tx1>the probes of a 1.06 microm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser emitted 542mW/cm2</tx1> for the treated subjects and were <tx2>inactive</tx2> for the control subjects. Subject's perception of benefit, level of function as assessed by the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and lumbar mobility. The treated group had a time-dependent improvement in two of the three outcome measures: perception of benefit and level of function. These results were most marked at the midpoint evaluation (p < .005, p < .01) and end of treatment (p < .017, p < .001) but tended to lessen at the 1-month follow-up (p < .10, p < .004). Lumbar mobility did not differ between the groups at any time. All tests were two-sample t tests with unequal variances. <tx1_a>Treatment with low-intensity 1.06 microm laser irradiation</tx1_a> produced a moderate reduction in pain and improvement in function in patients with musculoskeletal low back pain. Benefits, however, were limited and decreased with time. Further research is warranted.

Abstract 148 of 500

Activated B cells have recently been shown to produce soluble CD23 from their membranes. The serum-soluble CD23 concentration in 21 patients with pelvic pain diagnosed as having endometriosis and confirmed by histology, and in 18 patients without pelvic pain, who had a normal pelvis during laparoscopic sterilization, was studied by chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The endometriosis patients were randomized to 3 months of either danazol or leuprolide acetate injection. Serum was taken before and after 3 months of therapy. The serum-soluble CD23 concentration was significantly elevated in patients with endometriosis when compared with the controls (P < 0.0001). There was no correlation between soluble CD23 concentrations and the severity of endometriosis (r = 0.48, P > 0.05). The serum concentration of soluble CD23 decreased significantly on treatment with danazol but not leuprolide acetate (P < 0.05). We conclude that the elevation of soluble CD23 in patients with endometriosis suggests that there is activation of B cells, which respond to danazol but not leuprolide acetate injection.

Abstract 149 of 500

In a clinical trial of 172 patients at four medical centers, interferon alfa-2b (1.5 x 10(6) IU) or a placebo was injected directly into biopsy-proved noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas three times weekly for 3 weeks, for a cumulative dose of 13.5 million IU. Efficacy of treatment was determined at 16 to 20 weeks by examination of biopsy specimens that demonstrated cure of lesions in 86% of interferon-treated patients and in only 29% of placebo-treated patients. During the treatment course and follow-up, an initial inflammatory response was observed at the treatment sites, followed by diminished erythema, improvement in overall appearance, and a decrease in size of lesions. Side effects of treatment, mainly flu-like symptoms, were usually mild and transient and occurred more commonly in the interferon-treated group. Only three patients, all in the interferon-treated group, discontinued therapy because of side effects. One year after initiation of therapy, 81% of interferon recipients and 20% of those given the placebo remained tumor free. Noduloulcerative and superficial lesions were equally responsive to treatment with interferon. For some patients with noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas, intralesional interferon alfa-2b may be an alternative, effective treatment.

Abstract 150 of 500

A 12-week <tx2>placebo</tx2>-controlled, randomized clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate <tx1>imipramine</tx1> as a treatment for cocaine abuse, and to examine whether its effect may be limited to subgroups defined by route of use or by diagnosis of depression. <n>One-hundred thirteen</n> patients were randomized, stratified by route of use and depression. All patients received weekly individual counseling. Compared to <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> the <tx1_a>imipramine</tx1_a> group showed greater reductions in cocaine craving, cocaine euphoria, and depression, but the effect of <tx1_a>imipramine</tx1_a> on cocaine use was less clear. A favorable response, defined as at least 3 consecutive, urine-confirmed, cocaine-free weeks was achieved by 19% (11/59) of patients on <tx1_a>imipramine</tx1_a> compared to 7% (4/54) on <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> (P < 0.09). The <tx1_a>imipramine</tx1_a> effect was greater among nasal users--33% (9/27) response on <tx1_a>imipramine</tx1_a> vs. 5% (1/22) on <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> (P < 0.02). Response was also more frequent, but not significantly so, among depressed users on <tx1_a>imipramine</tx1_a> (26%, 10/38) than on <tx2_a>placebo</tx2_a> (13%, 4/31) (P < 0.19). Response rates were low in intravenous and freebase users and those without depression. Considered together with the literature on desipramine, these data suggest tricyclic antidepressants are not promising as a mainstay of treatment for unselected cocaine abusers. However, tricyclics may be useful for selected cocaine abusers with comorbid depression or intranasal use, or in conjunction with a more potent psychosocial intervention.
