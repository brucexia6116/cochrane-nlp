S'Adrenaline is the single most important therapeutic agent used in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Ideally it should be given into a large central vein but the European Resuscitation Council, the American Heart Association and the Resuscitation Council (U.K.) advise that adrenaline may be given into the trachea if i.v. access is not available. We have studied the effects of intra-tracheal and i.v. adrenaline in 16 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Log dose-response curves were constructed for systolic arterial pressure and heart rate responses. Intra-tracheal doses of adrenaline up to 10 micrograms kg-1, approximately one-third of that recommended for resuscitation, had no effect on arterial pressure or heart rate, whereas adrenaline 0.1 microgram kg-1 i.v. produced a mean increase in systolic pressure of 24 mm Hg. The intra-tracheal doses recommended for resuscitation (2-3 mg) are likely to be ineffective and consideration should be given to abandoning the tracheal route for adrenaline in ACLS.'

S'We evaluated and compared the effects on glycaemic control of two different exercise protocols in elderly men with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \n                 Eighteen patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus carried out home-based bicycle training for 5 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two training programmes at 60% of maximal oxygen uptake: three 10 min sessions per day (3 x 10) or one 30 min session per day (1 x 30). Plasma insulin, C-peptide and glucose concentrations were measured during a 3 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin sensitivity index (ISI(composite)), pre-hepatic insulin secretion rates (ISR) and change in insulin secretion per unit change in glucose concentrations (B(total)) were calculated. \n                 Cardiorespiratory fitness increased in response to training in both groups. In group 3 x 10 (n = 9) fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.01), 120 min glucose OGTT (p = 0.04) and plasma glucose concentration areas under the curve at 120 min (p < 0.04) and 180 min (p = 0.07) decreased. These parameters remained unchanged in group 1 x 30 (n = 9). No significant changes were found in ISI(composite), ISR and B(total) in either of the exercise groups. In a matched time-control group (n = 10), glycaemic control did not change. \n                 Moderate to high-intensity training performed at 3 x 10 min/day is preferable to 1 x 30 min/day with regard to effects on glycaemic control. This is in spite of the fact that cardiorespiratory fitness increased similarly in both exercise groups. A possible explanation is that the energy expenditure associated with multiple short daily sessions may be greater than that in a single daily session.'

S'To explore the therapeutic effect of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) for burn wounds of degree II in the elderly patients. \n                 From February 2003 to October 2008, 80 patients with burn wounds of degree II were treated and randomly divided into two groups (n=40). In treatment group, there were 24 males and 16 females with an average age of 70 years (60-86 years), including 20 cases of superficial II degree and 20 cases of deep II degree. Burn wounds were caused by flame in 23 cases, by hot liquid in 16 cases, and by electricity in 1 case. The mean time from injury to hospitalization was (2.87 +/- 2.57) hours. The wounds were treated with silver sulfadiazine (SD-Ag) and rhEGF. In control group, there were 18 males and 22 females with an average age of 69 years (61-83 years), including 19 cases of superficial II degree and 21 cases of deep II degree. Burn wounds were caused by flame in 23 cases, by hot liquid in 14 cases, by electricity in 2 cases, and by chemistry in 1 case. The mean time from injury to hospitalization was (3.39 +/- 3.33) hours. The wounds were treated with SD-Ag. The dressing was changed every day until wounds healing. There were no significant differences in general data between two groups (P > 0.05). \n                 Wound did not heal in 1 case (deep II degree) of treatment group and in 5 cases (deep II degree) of control group over 40 days and free skin graft was used to repair wound. One case (superficial II degree) in control group gave up treatment. One case (deep II degree) died of pulmonary infection in treatment group. These cases were excluded and 72 cases were analysed. No other side reactions were observed in treatment group except for flash stabbing pain (4 cases) and pruritus (2 cases). Wound infection occurred in 5 cases of the control group and in 3 cases of the treatment group, and wound healed after symptomatic treatment. The healing time of burn wound was (14.30 +/- 1.26) days (superficial II degree) and (26.11 +/- 2.97) days (deep II degree) in the treatment group, was (16.22 +/- 1.40) days (superficial II degree) and (29.13 +/- 4.99) days (deep II degree) in control group, showing significant difference between two groups (P < 0.05). \n                 In combined treatment, rhEGF can promote the healing of burn wounds of degree II in the elderly patients.'

S'Chronic management of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders is frequently complicated by symptomatic relapse. An open-label, randomized, active-controlled, 2-year trial evaluated 710 patients with schizophrenia or related disorders who were switched from stable treatment with oral risperidone, olanzapine, or conventional neuroleptics to risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) or oral quetiapine. Primary effectiveness evaluation was time-to-relapse. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs) reported for the duration of the study, Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs. A total of 666 patients (n=329 RLAI, n=337 quetiapine) were evaluable for effectiveness measures. Baseline demographics were similar between treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier estimate of time-to-relapse was significantly longer with RLAI (p<0.0001). Relapse occurred in 16.5% of patients with RLAI and 31.3% with quetiapine. RLAI and quetiapine were both safe and well tolerated. Weight gain affected 7% of patients with RLAI and 6% with quetiapine, with mean end point increases of 1.25\xc2\xb16.61 and 0\xc2\xb16.55\xe2\x80\x89kg, respectively. There were no significant between-group differences in weight gain. ESRS total scores decreased similarly after randomization to either RLAI or quetiapine. Extrapyramidal AEs occurred in 10% of patients with RLAI and 6% with quetiapine. Treatment-emergent potentially prolactin-related AEs were reported in 15 (5%) patients with RLAI and 5 (2%) patients with quetiapine; hyperprolactinemia was reported in 43 (13.1%) patients with RLAI and 5 (1.5%) patients with quetiapine. Somnolence occurred in 2% of patients with RLAI and 11% with quetiapine. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a randomized clinical trial directly comparing relapse prevention with a second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotic and oral therapy. Time-to-relapse in stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder was significantly longer in patients randomized to RLAI compared with those randomized to oral quetiapine. Both antipsychotics were generally well tolerated.'

S'Seventy-three children under the age of 18 months presenting with acute gastroenteritis were given an electrolyte mixture with added sucrose or glucose in a randomized double-blind trial. The time taken to recovery in those sucessfully treated as out-patients was identical. However, of the 34 who received glucose, 11 (32%) required admission compared with 7 (18%) of the 39 who received sucrose. There was a wide range of osmolality of the made-up feeds, indicating inaccuracy in diluting the solutions as prescribed, but this did not in general correlate with need for admission. Sucrose-electrolyte solution is at least as effective as a glucose-electrolyte solution for the out-patient management of acute gastroenteritis in infancy. The cheapness and easy availability of sucrose commends its use in developed and developing countries.'

S'Young drivers\' accident involvement may be explained by a number of different factors, one of which is that they tend to overestimate their skill in driving a car. This study is based upon the assumption that the degree of overestimation is related to the type of training the driver has received. In an experiment, two different strategies for training have been compared with regard to their influence on estimated and actual driving skill, as well as the drivers\' degree of overestimation of their own skill. One of the strategies, used in the "skill" group was to make the learner as skilled as possible in handling a braking and avoidance manoeuvre in a critical situation. The other strategy, used in the "insight" group was to make the driver aware of the fact that his own skill in braking and avoidance in critical situations may be limited and unpredictable. The experiment was carried out at the Bromma driving practice area in Stockholm. Low friction has been simulated by using "Skid Car" equipment. Fifty-three learner drivers were randomly divided into two groups. Each of the groups was taught on the basis of one of the strategies. The training session was 30 minutes long. One week later, the drivers returned to take part in a test of their estimated and actual skill. The "skill" group estimated their skill higher than the "insight" group. No difference was found between the groups regarding their actual skill. The results confirm the main hypothesis that the skill training strategy produces more false overestimation than the insight training strategy.'

S'In the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) trial, combined ezetimibe (10 mg) and simvastatin (40 mg) decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 50% and ischemic cardiovascular event (ICE) risk by 22% compared to placebo. A larger decrease in ICE risk might have been expected for the degree of lipid-lowering observed. This analysis investigated relations between changes in lipoprotein components (LCs), and ICE risk decrease in the SEAS trial in all patients, by severity of aortic stenosis (AS), and compared to results of other clinical trials. A total of 1,570 patients with baseline aortic jet velocity (JV) data, baseline and 1-year low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, and no ICEs during the first year were included in the analysis. Relations between on-treatment measurements of 1-year LCs and time-to-ICE occurrence were assessed in all patients and in JV tertiles (<2.8, 2.8 to 3.3, and >3.3 m/s). Observed and predicted ICE risk decreases were compared by Cox model. Decreases in LCs after 1 year of ezetimibe plus simvastatin were associated with decreased ICE risk in all patients and in the 2 lower JV tertiles (p <0.05 to <0.001) but not in tertile 3. In JV tertiles 1 and 2, ICE risk decreased by 47% and 36%, respectively, was reasonably well predicted by all LCs, and was consistent with findings from meta-regression analyses in other populations. In conclusion, the degree of lipid lowering by ezetimibe plus simvastatin may predict the extent of ICE risk decrease in patients with mild AS, but ICE risk prediction in patients with more severe AS is confounded by AS-associated cardiovascular events and a shorter interval of exposure to lipid lowering.'

S"Labetalol reduces blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The effects of a therapeutic dose of intravenous labetalol upon the cardiovascular responses to intravenous isoproterenol and norepinephrine in 6 normotensive subjects were studied in order to investigate the drug's mode of action. Before labetalol, intravenous isoproterenol increased heart rate and reduced diastolic blood pressure in a dose-dependant manner; likewise, intravenous norepinephrine increased both systolic and diastolic pressure. The order of administration of these agonists was randomized between the subjects before and after labetalol. Following labetalol (1.5 mg/kg intravenously) the effects of isoproterenol were antagonized such that cumulative log-dose response curves of mean isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate and reductions in diastolic pressure were shifted to the right in a parallel manner to approximately the same extent. At the same time, the mean norepinephrine-induced increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also antagonized in a competitive manner. These responses were compared with others in the same subjects under the same conditions and it was concluded that the antihypertensive effect of labetalol is explained by concurrent blockade of alpha-and beta-adrenoceptors."

S"Hypotension is a major concern of the anaesthetists whenever subarachnoid block is performed especially in obstetric patients. Vasopressors have been shown to be more effective at limiting spinal hypotension than other treatment of hypotension like preloading and left uterine displacement. The aim of the study is to compare the effect of bolus intravenous Ephedrine with Phenylephrine for the maintenance of arterial blood pressure during elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. This was a randomized, double blind, controlled study of sixty two healthy parturients American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) status 1 and 2 at term with singleton pregnancy who consented to subarachnoid block at University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. The parturients were preloaded with 10 ml per kg of crystalloid before the induction of spinal anaesthesia with injection of 2.5 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric Bupivacaine at L3/L4 levels. Ephedrine 5 mg (group A; n = 31) or phenylephrine 100 ug (group B; n = 31) was given for the maintenance of arterial blood pressure. Results showed that the incidence of hypotension in the 62 patients was 24.2%. Both vasopressors effectively restored both the systolic and the diastolic blood pressure. There was significant difference in heart rate between the two groups. Nausea occurred in both groups and was found in hypotensive patients, no patient vomited during the procedure. The mean APGAR Scores were similar for the two groups; no baby had Apgar score of < 8 in either group. We concluded that phenylephrine is safe and can be used as effectively as Ephedrine. Its administration results in higher blood pressure than Ephedrine in parturients undergoing Caesarean Section under spinal anaesthesia."

S'The purpose of the study was to compare the degree of bowel emptying at colonoscopy after preparation with either traditional water enema, dietary restrictions and laxatives or after oral lavage solution (Klean-Prep). Colonoscopy was performed in 104 patients over a two month period, 56 patients being allocated to the conventional preparation and 48 to Klean-Prep. The quality of bowel emptying was evaluated visually during endoscopy and by the proportion of incomplete colonoscopies. Bowel emptying was less satisfactory after Klean-Prep (p = 0.018) and seven incomplete colonoscopies resulted in contrast to two after conventional preparation. The results were obtained from a surgical department with a permanent small staff of motivated nurses preparing a huge number of patients for colonoscopy. No economic advantages could be demonstrated by the use of Klean-Prep.'

S'Noncoronary forms of atherosclerosis (including transient ischemic attacks or stroke of carotid origin or >50% stenosis of the carotid artery) are associated with a 10-year vascular risk of >20% and are considered as a coronary heart disease (CHD) -risk equivalent from the standpoint of lipid management. The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial included patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack and no known CHD regardless of the presence of carotid atherosclerosis. We evaluated the risk of developing clinically recognized CHD in SPARCL patients. \n                 A total of 4731 patients (mean age, 63 years) was randomized to 80 mg/day atorvastatin placebo. The rates of major coronary event, any CHD event, and any revascularization procedure were evaluated. \n                 After 4.9 years of follow-up, the risks of a major coronary event and of any CHD end point in the placebo group were 5.1% and 8.6%, respectively. The rate of outcome of stroke decreased over time, whereas the major coronary event rate was stable. Relative to those having a large vessel-related stroke at baseline, those having a transient ischemic attack, hemorrhagic stroke, small vessel stroke, or a stroke of unknown cause had similar absolute rates for a first major coronary event and for any CHD event; transient ischemic attack, small vessel, and unknown cause groups had lower absolute revascularization procedure rates. Major coronary event, any CHD event, and any revascularization procedure rates were similarly reduced in all baseline stroke subtypes in the atorvastatin arm compared with placebo with no heterogeneity between groups. \n                 CHD risk can be substantially reduced by atorvastatin therapy in patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack regardless of stroke subtype.'

S'Both core and skin temperatures contribute to steady-state thermoregulatory control. Dynamic thermoregulatory responses trigger aggressive defenses against rapid thermal perturbations. These responses potentially complicate interpretation of thermoregulatory studies and could slow induction of therapeutic hypothermia. We thus tested the hypothesis that rapid external skin-cooling triggers vasoconstriction and shivering at higher mean skin temperatures than slow or moderate rates of skin cooling. \n                 Eleven healthy volunteers were cooled at 3 skin-cooling rates using forced air or/and conductive cooling in random order. One day volunteers received slow (\xe2\x89\x882\xc2\xb0C/h) skin cooling, and on another day, they received both medium (\xe2\x89\x884\xc2\xb0C/h) and fast (\xe2\x89\x886\xc2\xb0C/h) skin cooling. An endovascular heat-exchanging catheter maintained core temperature. Fingertip blood flow \xe2\x89\xa40.25 mL/min defined onset of vasoconstriction; sustained \xe2\x89\xa525% increase in oxygen consumption defined onset of shivering. Results were evaluated with repeated-measures analysis of variance, with P < 0.05 representing statistical significance. \n                 Volunteers were 25 \xc2\xb1 5 years of age (mean \xc2\xb1 SD), 175 \xc2\xb1 7 cm tall, and weighed 63 \xc2\xb1 10 kg. Core temperature remained constant (\xe2\x89\x8837\xc2\xb0C) throughout each study day. At vasoconstriction, mean skin temperatures were 33.2\xc2\xb0C (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32.0\xc2\xb0C, 34.4\xc2\xb0C), 33.5\xc2\xb0C (95% CI: 32.3\xc2\xb0C, 34.7\xc2\xb0C), and 33.0\xc2\xb0C (95% CI: 31.4\xc2\xb0C, 34.6\xc2\xb0C) at slow, medium, and fast skin-cooling rates, respectively. Mean skin temperatures at shivering were also comparable: 31.4\xc2\xb0C (95% CI: 30.3\xc2\xb0C, 32.5\xc2\xb0C), 31.5\xc2\xb0C (95% CI: 30.2\xc2\xb0C, 32.8\xc2\xb0C), and 30.7\xc2\xb0C (95% CI: 28.9\xc2\xb0C, 32.5\xc2\xb0C), respectively. \n                 Onset of vasoconstriction and shivering occurred at similar mean skin temperatures with all 3 cooling rates. Aggressive surface cooling can thus be used in thermoregulatory studies and for induction of therapeutic hypothermia without provoking dynamic thermoregulatory defenses.'

S'When airway management is difficult, various measures can be taken to facilitate tracheal intubation. The Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes were developed for this purpose. We hypothesised that the Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes would perform better than a conventional laryngoscope in the management of a simulated difficult airway. We also hypothesised that the indirect laryngoscopes would perform comparably. \n                 In a randomised controlled study, 60 anaesthetists (30 with no or little experience and 30 with broader experience in the use of the Bullard laryngoscope, referred to as beginners and experts, respectively) performed three successive intubation attempts using conventional, Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes in two simulated difficult airway scenarios: neck immobilisation (scenario A) and neck immobilisation with additional tongue oedema (scenario B). The primary endpoint was overall intubation success rate. Secondary endpoints were time required for successful intubation, the amount of dental stress exerted during laryngoscopy and satisfaction with each airway device. \n                 In scenario A, intubation success rates were 97-100% with all devices. In scenario B, all participants failed to intubate the trachea using the conventional laryngoscope. When using the Bullard laryngoscope, intubation success rates of 87-97% did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) from those during scenario A and between groups (beginners vs. experts). In contrast, when using the Airtraq laryngoscope, the overall intubation success rate was significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared with scenario A and compared with use of the Bullard laryngoscope, and differed between beginners and experts (20 and 50%, respectively). In cases of successful intubation, intubation times were comparable between devices and groups. Intubation times were longer during scenario B. Dental stress was always lower (P < 0.05) during use of the Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes compared with the conventional laryngoscope, lowest (P < 0.05) during use of the Bullard laryngoscope and (with the exception of use of the conventional laryngoscope by the experts) higher during scenario B than during scenario A. In scenario A, participants preferred both video laryngoscopes to the conventional laryngoscope. \n                 In a moderately difficult airway scenario, all laryngoscopes performed equally well. However, in a more difficult airway scenario, the Bullard and Airtraq laryngoscopes performed better than the conventional laryngoscope, with the Bullard device performing better than the Airtraq. This may be in part related to differing prior experiences of operators with the respective airway devices.'

S'The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to determine acceptance, safety, and efficacy of low protein and phosphorus diets in patients with progressive renal disease. During the feasibility phase, 96 patients aged 18 to 75 years, with previously declining reciprocal serum creatinine concentration (1/PCr) and current glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 7.5 to 80 ml/min/1.73 m2, were randomly assigned four study diets. After randomization, 91 patients were followed for a mean duration of 14.1 months. GFR, 1/PCr and creatinine clearance (CCr) were measured every three months. In an earlier report, we demonstrated relatively weak correlations of rates of change in GFR and 1/PCr during the feasibility phase; the proportion of variability in 1/PCr slopes that was explained by variability in GFR slopes (r2) was only 0.49 to 0.55. In this study, we examined the relationship of GFR and 1/PCr to other determinants of the serum creatinine concentration, including filtration (GFCr), secretion (TSCr), and total renal excretion (UCrV) of creatinine. Our results show that these parameters varied widely among individuals and changed over time. These findings may explain, in part, the relatively weak correlations. These results strengthen our previous suggestion that the rate of change in 1/PCr may not be an accurate index of the rate of change in GFR and raise questions about the validity of conclusions from other studies in which the efficacy of dietary modification in retarding the progression of renal disease was based principally on measurements of 1/PCr.'

S'Directional atherectomy is an endovascular interventional technique for excision and removal of obstructive arterial lesions. To evaluate whether atherectomy would provide better results than conventional balloon angioplasty (BA) in symptomatic femoropopliteal disease, a prospective randomized study comparing the early and late outcomes of these techniques was conducted. The rate of restenosis or occlusion was assessed by use of color-flow duplex scanning during the follow-up period. \n                 Seventy-three patients were randomized between atherectomy (38 patients) and BA (35 patients). All patients had segmental lesions of the femoropopliteal arteries amenable to either technique. The median follow-up duration was 13 months (range 1 to 39). Follow-up comprised regular clinical and hemodynamic assessment and color-flow duplex examinations. Restenosis was defined on the basis of a peak systolic velocity ratio of 2.5 or greater, and occlusion of the treated segment was diagnosed if flow signals were absent, that is, loss of patency. \n                 Residual stenoses (> or = 30% diameter reduction) resulted in five patients (13%) undergoing atherectomy and three patients (9%) undergoing BA. At 1 month clinical and hemodynamic improvement by Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery criteria for lower limb ischemia was observed in 34 patients (89%) treated with atherectomy and in 34 (97%) treated with BA. By life-table analysis the cumulative rate of clinical and hemodynamic success at 2 years was 52% in patients treated with atherectomy and 87% in patients treated with BA (p = 0.06). The patency rate at 2 years of treated segments was 34% in the atherectomy group and 56% in patients treated with BA (p = 0.07). In patients with lesions greater than 2 cm, the 1-year patency rate of AT was significantly lower than BA (p = 0.03). \n                 Atherectomy does not result in an improved clinical and hemodynamic outcome. Furthermore atherectomy of segmental atherosclerotic femoropopliteal disease does not result in a better patency rate than BA, and, in lesions with greater length than 2 cm, the atherectomy results are significantly worse.'

S'In a double-blind study, the efficacy and tolerability of nimesulide (100mg twice daily) were compared with those of diclofenac (50mg twice daily) when administered orally to 50 patients with acute superficial thrombophlebitis of the lower limbs. Pain relief and amelioration of inflammation were apparent in patients treated with either nimesulide or diclofenac; however, gastric intolerance was noted more frequently in those receiving diclofenac. The results of this study suggest that nimesulide should be considered as an alternative to diclofenac and other first-line NSAIDs in the treatment of acute superficial thrombophlebitis.'

S'Intramuscular and intranasal synthetic salmon calcitonin (sCT) has long been used in the treatment of involutional osteoporosis. A new suppository formulation was developed and many studies demonstrated that rectally administered sCT is efficacious and well tolerated. Thirty postmenopausal women, who had a bone mineral density at the lumbar spine below the mean of age-matched women, were enrolled in this study. Using an open balanced, randomized design, the patients were allocated to two groups of treatment: sCT suppositories at the dose of 100 UI/day or 200 UI every other day for six months. Treatment with sCT suppositories caused a statistically significant decrease of pain in both study groups. Bone mineral density at lumbar spine showed an increase in both study groups with significant difference respect the basal value for the patients treated with sCT on alternate day. Based on the results of this study, we can thus conclude that sCT in suppository formulation is effective in reducing pain sintomatology, bone loss and turnover in involutional osteoporosis.'

S'The pharmacokinetics of ketoprofen from a fast-dissolving lyophilized tablet (LT), which need not be swallowed, as compared to an immediate release (IR) tablet as reference after single oral dose (25 mg) administration was determined in six healthy subjects aged between 25-40 years using a randomized crossover design. In this study, the rate and extent of absorption of ketoprofen were found to be very different after administration of the LT and the IR tablet. The rate of absorption of ketoprofen from LT was significantly faster than that of IR tablet and had significantly higher Cmax (by about 50%) and earlier tmax (by 15 min), whereas the extent of absorption expressed by AUC was about 68% higher as compared to the IR tablet. The relative bioavailability (frel) of the LT compared with the IR tablet was 168%. The difference between the two formulations for half-life and MRT were statistically significant (p<0.05). The tolerance of the two tested formulations was excellent. Ketoprofen LT remained physically and chemically stable for 12 months at 25 degrees C and 60% relative humidity.'

S"Rahimi, R. Creatine supplementation decreases oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation induced by a single bout of resistance exercise. J Strength Cond Res 25(12): 3448-3455, 2011-Creatine (Cr), or methyl guanidine-acetic acid, can be either ingested from exogenous sources, such as fish or meat, or produced endogenously by the body, primarily in the liver. It is used as an ergogenic aid to improve muscle mass, strength, and endurance. Heretofore, Cr's positive therapeutic benefits in various oxidative stress-associated diseases have been reported in the literature and, recently, Cr has also been shown to exert direct antioxidant effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an acute bout of resistance exercise (RE) on oxidative stress response and oxidative DNA damage in male athletes and whether supplementation with Cr could negate any observed differences. Twenty-seven resistance-trained men were randomly divided into a Cr supplementation group (the Cr group [21.6 \xc2\xb1 3.6 years], taking 4 \xc3\x97 5 g Cr monohydrate per day) or a placebo (PL) supplementation group (the PL group [21.2 \xc2\xb1 3.2 years], taking 4 \xc3\x97 5 g maltodextrin per day). A double-blind research design was employed for a 7-day supplementation period. Before and after the seventh day of supplementation, the subjects performed an RE protocol (7 sets of 4 exercises using 60-90 1 repetition maximum) in the flat pyramid loading pattern. Blood and urine samples taken before, immediately, and 24-hour postexercise were analyzed for plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) excretion. Before the supplementation period, a significant increase in the urinary 8-OHdG excretion and plasma MDA levels was observed after RE. The Cr supplementation induces a significant increase in athletics performance, and it attenuated the changes observed in the urinary 8-OHdG excretion and plasma MDA. These results indicate that Cr supplementation reduced oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation induced by a single bout of RE."

S"The purpose of this study was to compare the use of bioactive glass to demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) in the treatment of human periodontal osseous defects. Fifteen systemically healthy patients (6 males and 9 females, aged 30 to 63) with moderate to advanced adult periodontitis were selected for the study. All patients underwent initial therapy, which included scaling and root planing, oral hygiene instruction, and an occlusal adjustment when indicated, followed by re-evaluation 4 to 6 weeks later. Paired osseous defects in each subject were randomly selected to receive grafts of bioactive glass or DFDBA. Both soft and hard tissue measurements were taken the day of surgery (baseline) and at the 6-month re-entry surgery. The clinical examiner was calibrated and blinded to the surgical procedures, while the surgeon was masked to the clinical measurements. Statistical analysis was performed by using the paired Student's t test. The results indicated that probing depths were reduced by 3.07 +/- 0.80 mm with the bioactive glass and 2.60 +/- 1.40 mm with DFDBA. Sites grafted with bioactive glass resulted in 2.27 +/- 0.88 mm attachment level gain, while sites grafted with DFDBA had a 1.93 +/- 1.33 mm gain in attachment. Bioactive glass sites displayed 0.53 +/- 0.64 mm of crestal resorption and 2.73 mm bone fill. DFDBA-grafted sites experienced 0.80 +/- 0.56 mm of crestal resorption and 2.80 mm defect fill. The use of bioactive glass resulted in 61.8% bone fill and 73.33% defect resolution. DFDBA-grafted defects showed similar results, with 62.5% bone fill and 80.87% defect resolution. Both treatments provided soft and hard tissue improvements when compared to baseline (P < or = 0.0001). No statistical difference was found when comparing bioactive glass to DFDBA; however, studies with larger sample sizes may reveal true differences between the materials. This study suggests that bioactive glass is capable of producing results in the short term (6 months) similar to that of DFDBA when used in moderate to deep intrabony periodontal defects."

We sought to assess the outcome (severe exacerbations and healthcare use, lung function, quality of life and maintenance treatment) of a strategy based on daily home spirometry with teletransmission to an expert medical centre and whether it differs from that of a conventional strategy. 50 children with severe uncontrolled asthma were enrolled in a 12-month prospective study and were randomised into two groups: 1) treatment managed with daily home spirometry and medical feedback (HM) and 2) conventional treatment (CT). The children's mean age was 10.9 yrs (95% confidence interval 10.2-11.6). 44 children completed the study (21 in the HM group and 23 in the CT group).

S'Perioperative local anaesthetics are often used to reduce the postoperative pain in tonsillectomy. There exist three different ways of applying local anaesthetics: (1) pre-incisional peritonsillar; (2) post-tonsillectomy wound infiltration; (3) post-tonsillectomy packing with soaked gauze. The objective of the study is the evaluation of differences of pain reduction comparing the three different techniques of application. The study design mainly includes intra-individual, prospective and double-blinded. One hundred and eighty patients (3-45 years) with recurrent tonsillitis were included. The charts of 156 were eligible for analysis. Bupivacaine was applied on both sides randomized in different ways. Pain on each side was registered for 6 days on the ward by a blinded nurse. When directly compared with the other two application methods, the post-tonsillectomy injection of bupivacaine provides significantly better results during the monitored time period. Postoperative bleeding was observed in 11 (7.3%) cases without any correlation to an application procedure. No other adverse effects were observed. In conclusion, post-tonsillectomy infiltration of the wounds with bupivacaine is superior to pre-incisional infiltration technique as well as post-tonsillectomy packing of the wounds with 0.5% bupivacaine-soaked gauze swab.'

S'Repeated-agility sprint ability is an important performance characteristic of badminton players. However, it is unclear whether regular badminton training is sufficient to improve repeated-agility sprint ability or whether supplementary training is required. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether supplementing regular group training with short sessions of badminton-specific agility-sprint training conferred any greater changes in performance than regular training alone. Twelve national level badminton players completed a set of performance tests in the week before and after a 4-week training period. Performance tests consisted of 10- and 20-meter sprints, a multistage fitness test, a 300-meter shuttle run, and a novel badminton sprint protocol. After pretesting, pair-matched participants were randomly assigned into regular or supplementary training groups. Both groups undertook regular national squad training consisting of 4 2-hour sessions per week. In addition, the supplementary group completed a high-intensity sprint-training regime consisting of 7 to 15 repeats of badminton-specific sprints twice per week. Relative to control, the supplementary training group reported improvements (mean +/- 90% confidence limits) in the 300-meter shuttle run (2.4% +/- 2.7%) and badminton sprint protocol (3.6% +/- 2.6%). However, there were no substantial difference in either the 10-meter (-0.3% +/- 2.1%) or 20-meter (-0.6% +/- 1.8%) sprint or the multistage fitness test (0.0% +/- 2.7%). Supplementing regular training with sessions of short-duration sprint training appears to lead to worthwhile increases in repeated-agility sprint performance with national level badminton players.'

S'The bioequivalence of two rimantadine tablet formulations was determined. \n                 The study was designed as a randomized, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study. Twenty-four healthy male volunteers received a single 100 mg dose of rimantadine hydrochloride as test (Rimantadin Lachema 100 tbl. obd., produced by Lachema, a.s., Brno, Czech Republic) and reference formulations (Elumadine 100 tbl. obd., produced by Forest Pharmaceuticals, St. Louis, USA). The two administrations were separated by 14 days and were performed in the fasting state. Blood samples were obtained at 15 time points during the interval 0-120 h after administration. Rimantadine plasma concentrations were determined by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. \n                 The geometric mean concentration-time profiles of rimantadine after administration of the two formulations were superimposable. The following pharmacokinetic parameters refer to the geometric mean [exp(mean +/- SD)] values for the test and reference formulations, respectively: Cmax (ng/ml) 70.5 (60.0-82.7) vs. 70.0 (59.9 to 81.7), AUC(0-infinity) (ng x h/ml) 2872 (2224 to 3707) vs. 2849 (2195-3699), AUC(0-120 h) 2744 (2184-3448) vs. 2712 (2138-3441), t(1/2) (h) 25.8 (20.1-33.0) vs. 25.7 (20.6 to 32.1). Median (range) tmax (h) values were 4.5 (2.0-8.0) and 6.0 (2.0-8.0). Parametric 90% confidence intervals for the expected mean percentage ratios (test/reference) of the pharmacokinetic variables were within the range of 97% to 105%. The median (91.1% confidence interval) difference in tmax was -0.3 h (-2.0-0.5). The point and interval estimates were identical when truncated AUCs (0-96 h, 0-72 h, 0-48 h and 0-24 h) were used in calculations. \n                 The two rimantadine formulations were equivalent in both the rate and extent ofbioavailability and they were also well tolerated. This study confirms the findings of other studies showing that for immediate release formulations of drugs with long half-lives shortening the duration over which blood samples are collected improves the economics, is more ethical and does not impair the quality of data.'

S'This study was carried out in 75 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer. Patients were divided into three groups of 25. The control group received symptomatic corrective therapy prior to mastectomy. The two other groups were given neoadjuvant therapy with Ukrain injections. The first group received a total course dose of 50 mg Ukrain at single doses of 5 mg injected every second day (a total of 10 injections) and the second group received a total Ukrain dose of 100 mg but with single doses of 10 mg. Five to seven days after the last injection patients from all groups were subjected to mastectomy according to Halsted, Patey or Madden. No allergic reactions or adverse effects were observed after the first course of injections or the whole course of Ukrain therapy, regardless of the dose. After five to six injections some patients noticed slight burning sensations and insignificant morbidity in the tumor area, which, according to a number of authors, testifies to the therapeutic activity of the preparation. Practically all patients who were administered Ukrain noticed remarkable positive changes in the second half of treatment: improvement in appetite, normalization of sleep, disappearance of general weakness and the appearance of confidence in recovery. After the course of treatment with Ukrain, the contours of the tumorous node became more clearly defined, which facilitated mastectomy. Changes in the tumor tissue were one-sided in their qualitative differences in comparison to the control group and were not dose-dependent. Qualitative and quantitative reactions to Ukrain by both intact lymphatic nodes and those affected by the metastatic process contribute to more quantitative and radical performance of the most important stage of mastectomy--removal of the regional cellulose together with the lymphatic nodes. The results of this study showed the efficiency of both doses (50 and 100 mg) of Ukrain with neither performing significantly better than the other.'

S'Montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, is being developed for the treatment of asthma and related diseases. This study was designed to evaluate whether montelukast at clinically used dosage levels would interfere with the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. In a two-period, double-blind, randomized crossover study, 12 healthy male subjects received a single oral dose of 30 mg warfarin on the 7th day of a 12-day treatment with montelukast, 10 mg daily by mouth, or a placebo. Montelukast had no significant effect on the area under the plasma concentration-time curves and peak plasma concentrations of either R- or S-warfarin. However, slight but statistically significant decreases in time to peak concentration of both warfarin enantiomers and in elimination half-life of the less potent R-warfarin were observed in the presence of montelukast. These changes were not considered as clinically relevant. Montelukast had no significant effect on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, as assessed by the international normalized ratio (INR) for prothrombin time (AUC0-144 and INR maximum). The results of this study suggest that a clinically important interaction between these drugs is unlikely to occur in patients requiring concomitant administration of both drugs.'

Patients undergoing PCI with clean arterial access and no procedural hematoma were randomized to receive the AngioSeal or Femostop device to achieve femoral arterial hemostasis. Times from procedure end to removal from angiography table, hemostasis, ambulation, and hospital discharge were recorded. Bedside nursing/medical officer care time, vascular complications, and disposable use were also documented. Patient comfort was assessed using Present Pain Intensity and Visual Analogue scales at baseline, 4 hr, 8 hr, and the morning after the procedure. One hundred twenty-two patients were enrolled (62 AngioSeal, 60 Femostop). Patients in the AngioSeal group took longer to be removed from the angiography table (11 +/- 4 vs. 9 +/- 3 min; P = 0.002) compared with the Femostop group. Time to hemostasis (0.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 6.4 +/- 1.7 hr; P < 0.001) and ambulation (17 +/- 8 vs. 22 +/- 13 hr; P = 0.004) were less in the AngioSeal group, although time to discharge was not different. Nursing and medical officer time was no different. Disposables including device cost were higher in the AngioSeal group (209 dollars +/- 13 vs. 53 dollars +/- 9; P < 0.001). On a Visual Analogue scale, patients reported more pain at 4 hr (P < 0.001) and 8 hr (P < 0.001) in the Femostop group. The worst amount of pain at any time point was also more severe in the Femostop group (P < 0.001). Similar results were found on a Present Pain Intensity scale of pain. There were no differences in ultrasound-determined vascular complications (two each). Femoral access site closure using the AngioSeal device resulted in a small delay in leaving the angiography suite and a higher disposable cost compared to using the Femostop device. However, patients receiving the AngioSeal were able to ambulate sooner and reported less pain, which may justify the increased costs involved. \n                 (c) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.'

S'This study investigated whether the presence of plinth padding influences measured posteroanterior spinal stiffness. Two measures of posteroanterior stiffness, the slope of the loading curve (K) and the displacement at 30 N (D30) were made at three vertebral levels: L3, T12 and T6, on a rigid and a padded plinth in 24 asymptomatic subjects. Analysis of variance demonstrated a significant reduction in K and increase in D30 when measured on the padded compared to the rigid surface and an interaction effect for both the K and D30 measures, indicating that the effect of the padding depends upon the vertebral level tested. The correlations between the padded and unpadded stiffness measures ranged from 0.70 to 0.87.

S'The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to compare the results obtained in ICSI with two culture media, P-1 (Irvine Scientific) and IVF-50 (Scandinavian IVF Science). \n                 A total of 182 patients undergoing ICSI treatment were randomly included in this study and divided in two groups: Group I: P-1 medium (n = 91) or Group II: IVF-50 medium (n = 91). All the embryos were transferred on the second day. \n                 Patient age did not differ (p = .29) between Group I (34.8 +/- 4.8) and Group II (34.0 +/- 4.5). The number of oocytes retrieved from Group I (10.6 +/- 6.7) was also similar (p = .49) to that retrieved from Group II (11.1 +/- 6.4). In addition, there was no difference (p = .25) in the number of oocytes retrieved at metaphase II between Group I (7.9 +/- 4.6) and Group II (8.7 +/- 4.6). Normal fertilization rates, abnormal fertilization rates, and cleavage rates were similar (p = .62, p = .48, and p = .9, respectively) between Group I (68.4 +/- 23.3%, 6.7 +/- 10.3%, and 98.7 +/- 4.6%) and Group II (65.3 +/- 26.2%, 9.0 +/- 13.8%, and 98.9 +/- 3.9%, respectively). The embryo score was also similar (p = .62) for both groups (Group I: 31.9 +/- 14.0 and Group II: 33.4 +/- 15.8). There was no difference in the number of embryos transferred (p = .69) between Group I (2.8 +/- 1.0) and Group II (2.8 +/- 1.1). In addition, pregnancy rates/puncture, pregnancy rates/transfer, implantation rates, and abortion rates were also similar for Group I (36.2%, 37.0%, 17.4%, and 12.1%, respectively) and Group II (31.8%, 33.7%, 15.8%, and 10.3%, respectively) (p = .64, p = .75, p = .72, and p = 1.0, respectively). \n                 There were no differences in the results obtained with culture media P-1 (Irvine Scientific) and IVF-50 (Scandinavian IVF Science) for ICSI and embryo culture.'

S'The Outpatient Long-term Intensive Therapy for Alcoholics (OLITA) is a four-step program of care for severely affected chronic alcoholics which, after inpatient detoxification, extends over a total of 2 years. High-frequency short-term individual therapeutic contacts, initially daily, are followed by a slow tapering of individual contact frequency and resolve in a group session once weekly towards the end of the second abstinent year. Further elements of OLITA are: (a) induction of alcohol intolerance by the application of aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitors; (b) introduction of control factors, i.e. controlled intake of deterrent medication and regular urine analysis for alcohol; and (c) allocation of responsibility to the patient with respect to the overall success of the therapeutic concept including his own physical rehabilitation. Thus far, 30 male alcoholic patients from two recruitment periods have been treated for 6-26 months with a success rate of 60% abstinent patients. In conclusion, OLITA, based on the gradual tapering of high-frequency therapeutic contacts, thus far unique among outpatient programs for alcoholics, represents a promising advance in the treatment of therapy-resistant chronic alcoholics.'

S"To determine whether a subtotal bovie tonsillectomy decreases postoperative pain following adenotonsillectomy. \n                 A prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was undertaken at a University Pediatric Children's Hospital and included 39 otherwise healthy children, aged 2-12 years, undergoing adenotonsillectomy. Patients were randomized to receive either a subtotal or total removal of the tonsils utilizing an electrocautery technique. The main outcome measures included a visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and while eating, time to take 100 cm(3) of fluid, throat, neck, and ear pain, quantity of liquids, activity level and incidence of emesis and retching. \n                 A repeated measures analysis using a repeated measures ANOVA failed to demonstrate a statistically significant impact with either treatment for VAS at rest or while eating (p=0.52 and 0.48, respectively). A repeated measures analysis did not show either procedure significantly affecting throat, neck or ear pain, or liquid quantity. Time to take 100 cm(3) liquids and the incidence of emesis or retching were found not to be statistically significantly different between the treatment groups. \n                 Subtotal tonsillectomy via an electrocautery technique does not reduce postoperative pain or improve outcome parameters. Subtotal tonsillectomy with this technique is not recommended for this patient population."

S'Few rejuvenation and antiaging markers are used to evaluate food supplements. We measured three markers in peripheral blood to evaluate the antiaging effects of a food supplement containing placental extract. Samples were evaluated for CD34(+) cells, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and telomerase activity, which are all markers related to aging. To control the quality of this food supplement, five active components were monitored. In total, we examined 44 individuals who took the food supplement from 1.2 months to 23 months; the average number of CD34(+) cells was almost 6-fold higher in the experimental group compared with the control group. Food supplement intake did not change serum IGF1 levels significantly. Finally, the average telomerase activity was 30% higher in the subjects taking this food supplement. In summary, our results suggest that the placental extract in the food supplement might contribute to rejuvenation and antiaging.'

S'In a double-blind trial, 32 patients with endogenous or neurotic depression requiring drug treatment in hospital were randomly allocated to a four-week treatment with amitriptylinoxide or amitriptyline. The initial dosage was, in most cases, 60 mg b.i.d. for both drugs. During the first week of treatment, the dose was increased to a maximum of 300 mg/day with amitriptylinoxide and to 240 mg/day with amitriptyline, depending on tolerability and clinical impression. This dose was then maintained, if possible, throughout the following three weeks. During this period the mean dose of amitriptylinoxide was 167 +/- 8 mg/day, that of amitriptyline 166 +/- 8 mg/day. Seven of the 32 patients (three in the amitriptylinoxide and four in the amitriptyline group) discontinued the trial. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by means of the AMDP system (scale 4), HAMD total scale, 4 HAMD subscales, and DSI and Bf-S scales. Tolerability was assessed using the AMDP system (scale 5) and a list of side-effects often associated with antidepressive drug treatment. With regard to therapeutic efficacy, no differences were noted between the two drugs except on the DSI scale. In contrast, there was a significant difference in tolerability--both in terms of the vegetative syndrome (AMDP) and the sum of side-effects--in favour of amitriptylinoxide.'

S'The aims of the present study were: (1) to determine whether short-term supplementation of beta-carotene (BC) or vitamin E (VE; alpha-tocopherol) would result in their respective accumulation in normal colonic mucosa and in adenomatous polyps; (2) to determine whether the intake of BC would interfere with the concentration of VE in these target tissues. \n                 Blood and colonic biopsy samples were taken before and after supplementation. \n                 Eighteen volunteers with colonic adenomatous polyps were enrolled into this study. \n                 The supplementation lasted for 43 days and patients were examined over the whole period. Subjects were randomised into four groups according to the four different supplementations: placebo, natural BC (25 000 IU/day), natural VE (400 IU/day), combination BC/VE. \n                 Initially we were aiming for recruitment of 20 patients in each group, however after 2 y of study (1997-1999), we terminated the study because of slow recruitment and analysed the data. In placebo subjects after supplementation, the plasma concentrations of BC and VE remained unchanged, however only two patients were recruited in this group and therefore we did not include this group in our final analysis. In BC group, the plasma BC concentrations increased significantly (P<0.001), while VE concentrations were unchanged. In VE group, VE concentrations increased (P<0.01) and BC did not change, and in BC/VE group both BC (P<0.001) and VE levels (P<0.01) increased significantly. After supplementation, the tissue concentration of BC in normal colonic mucosa in BC group increased significantly (P<0.01) while the VE concentration did not change. In VE group, the concentration of VE in normal colonic mucosa increased slightly but did not reach statistical significance. However, VE concentration increased significantly (P<0.05) in the polyps of this group. In BC/VE group, in which patients received the combination treatment, the BC concentration of normal colonic mucosa increased (P<0.05) but, surprisingly, the VE concentration decreased significantly (P<0.01). Interestingly in the polyps, although the BC concentration increased (P<0.01), the concentration of VE was reduced moderately but did not reach statistical significance. \n                 Supplementation of BC in doses used in this study may have significantly interfered with the VE concentration in the examined tissue and probably with its metabolic pathway.'

S'Bariatric surgery is widely performed to induce weight loss. \n                 The objective was to examine changes in vitamin status after 2 bariatric surgical techniques. \n                 A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2 Scandinavian hospitals. The subjects were 60 superobese patients [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)): 50-60]. The surgical interventions were either laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. All patients received multivitamins, iron, calcium, and vitamin D supplements. Gastric bypass patients also received a vitamin B-12 substitute. The patients were examined before surgery and 6 wk, 6 mo, and 1 y after surgery. \n                 Of 60 surgically treated patients, 59 completed the follow-up. After surgery, duodenal switch patients had lower mean vitamin A and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations and a steeper decline in thiamine concentrations than did the gastric bypass patients. Other vitamins (riboflavin, vitamin B-6, vitamin C, and vitamin E adjusted for serum lipids) did not change differently in the surgical groups, and concentrations were either stable or increased. Furthermore, duodenal switch patients had lower hemoglobin and total cholesterol concentrations and a lower BMI (mean reduction: 41% compared with 30%) than did gastric bypass patients 1 y after surgery. Additional dietary supplement use was more frequent among duodenal switch patients (55%) than among gastric bypass patients (26%). \n                 Compared with gastric bypass, duodenal switch may be associated with a greater risk of vitamin A and D deficiencies in the first year after surgery and of thiamine deficiency in the initial months after surgery. Patients who undergo these 2 surgical interventions may require different monitoring and supplementation regimens in the first year after surgery. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00327912.'

S'To elucidate the effects of alcohol on pineal rhythmicity, ethanol was administered in the evening in amounts usually consumed during social ingestion to nine healthy volunteers in a double blind, cross-over study. Plasma concentrations of melatonin, catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine), and ethanol were measured by RIA, high pressure liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography before and for 12 h after the administration of 0, 0.5, and 1 g ethanol/kg wt. Plasma melatonin and catecholamines displayed expected diurnal rhythms, with peak values at 0300-0400 h for melatonin and trough values at 0100-0400 h for catecholamines. Intake of ethanol between 1900-1945 h inhibited the nocturnal melatonin secretion dose-dependently during the first half of the night, with no changes in urinary excretion of melatonin. The inhibition was 41% (P < 0.05) from the control at midnight for both ethanol doses, 33% (P < 0.05) at 0100 h, and 18% (P < 0.05) at 0200 h for the higher dose. In addition, the higher dose of ethanol increased plasma norepinephrine levels at 2000 and 2200 h (P < 0.01) until 0400 h (P < 0.05). Taking into account the involvement of melatonin in the regulation of sleep and diurnal rhythms, we suggest that ethanol-induced suppression of nocturnal melatonin secretion and an increase in noradrenergic activity may be closely associated with disturbances in sleep and performance.'

Antitoxoplasmosis antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig] M and IgG) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. \n                 Changes in retinochoroidal lesion size, measured by a computer program written in the MATLAB environment, 6 weeks after initiation of treatment. Visual acuity (VA) changes, vitreous inflammatory response, adverse drug reactions, and rate of recurrence were secondary outcome measures. \n                 The mean number of injections in the IVCD group was 1.6. The lesion size reduction was statistically significant after treatment in both IVCD and CT groups (P < 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively). However, the difference in mean percentage of reduction at 6 weeks was not significant: 57.0 \xc2\xb1 27.8% in the IVCD group versus 58.4 \xc2\xb1 29.3% in the CT group (P = 0.569). In relation to the baseline, VA increased by 0.44 \xc2\xb1 0.24 and 0.29 \xc2\xb1 0.19 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units in the IVCD and CT groups, respectively (P < 0.001); however, the difference of VA improvement between the groups was not significant. The interaction effect of IgM and treatment group on lesion size reduction was significant (P = 0.002); this indicated that IgM-positive cases responded better to CT and IgM-negative cases responded better to IVCD treatment. Vitreous inflammation reduction was insignificant between the groups. Within 2 years, 4 eyes (2 in each group) had 1 episode of recurrence. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 2 patients in the CT group. No major injection-related complication was encountered in the IVCD group. \n                 Intravitreal injection of clindamycin and dexamethasone may be an acceptable alternative to the classic treatment in ocular toxoplasmosis. It may offer the patient more convenience, a safer systemic side effect profile, greater availability, and fewer follow-up visits and hematologic evaluations. \n                 Copyright \xc2\xa9 2011 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

S"The effects of treating climacteric complaints in post-menopausal women were studied in an open trial in which Org OD 14, a placebo and no treatment were compared. In addition to the symptomatic effects, clinical and laboratory parameters were also studied. One hundred and twenty-four women who had undergone a natural or surgical menopause completed 4 mth of randomized treatment; 35 received Org OD 14 (2.5 mg/day, per os), 46 a placebo, and 43 no treatment. The mean ages and time in years since menopause were comparable for each group. The parameters were assessed before treatment and after 4 mth. The results in the group treated with Org OD 14 were compared statistically with those for the other two groups using the chi 2 test, Student's t test or analysis of variance. A beneficial effect on clinical parameters was seen following Org OD 14 treatment. The results as regards hot flushes and sweating were significantly better statistically than those in the other groups. Org OD 14 was found to have no effect on the endometrium, breasts, body weight or blood pressure, while vaginal atrophy was slightly improved. Serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and phosphate were slightly reduced by Org OD 14. Liver function tests, clotting factors and the other routine laboratory parameters were not affected by Org OD 14 treatment. It was concluded that Org OD 14 is an effective and safe compound for the treatment of climacteric syndrome."

Objectives were to compare outcome after ambulatory and inpatient cleft lip surgery for adults with respect to perioperative complications (Early: pain, oedema of upper lip, bleeding, nausea or vomiting, infection, dehiscence; Late: visible scar and white roll discrepancy), to compare the economic benefits, and evaluate patient satisfaction in terms of acceptance for ambulatory surgery. \n                 This comparative study is carried out in Plastic Surgery Department, King Edward Medical University, Mayo Hospital, Lahore. The study included 80 adult patients fulfilling inclusion criteria and were randomly divided into two groups, i.e., Ambulatory (Group-A, n=40) and Inpatient (Group-B, n=40). Those belonging to ambulatory group were worked up on OPD basis, advised to report on morning of surgery, operated under loco-regional anaesthesia and were discharged on same day. Patients of inpatient group were admitted two days before surgery, worked up in ward, operated under general anaesthesia and were discharged on 2nd day. \n                 Ambulatory cleft lip surgery can be easily performed under loco-regional anaesthesia. Perioperative complications between these groups were comparable. Hospital stay was significantly reduced in ambulatory surgery. The patients felt more satisfied after ambulatory than inpatient surgery. \n                 Ambulatory cleft lip repair for adults is as safe as inpatient surgery. It is dependable option and can be successfully performed in our setup. It should be considered whenever possible due to cost effectiveness, reduction of waiting lists, earlier discharge and better utilisation of hospital resources.'

Mood (Profile of Moods States - Bipolar Form [POMS-BI] questionnaire), "quality of life" (Short Form 36 [SF-36] questionnaire) and plasma selenium were measured at baseline and six months. \n                 Supplementation significantly increased plasma selenium above baseline values: from an overall mean (SD) of 90(19) ng/g to 91(26), 144(27), 191(41) and 227(53) ng/g in the placebo, 100, 200, 300 microg selenium groups respectively (p < .001). Four hundred forty-eight participants completed the POMS-BI questionnaires at both time points, with no significant differences in total mood or mood-subscale scores seen between doses. After six months of supplementation, mean (SD) total mood scores for the four doses were 163(36), 161(37), 162(33), 162(34), F(3,443) = .25, p = .86. Quality of life was similarly unaffected. \n                 There was no evidence that selenium supplementation benefited mood or quality of life in these elderly volunteers. Though this is at odds with some previous results, our robust study design, much larger sample size and longer supplementation period, together with the evidence that the brain is a privileged site for selenium retention, suggest that this is a reliable finding.'

All patients received cyclosporine, steroids, and azathioprine. The primary endpoint was the incidence of acute rejection at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included the safety and tolerability of basiliximab and placebo, 1-year patient and graft survival, and significant medical events up to 12 months. \n                 During the first 6 months posttransplantation, acute rejection occurred in 20.8% of patients given basiliximab versus 34.9% of patients administered placebo (P=0.005). Similarly, there was a reduction in biopsy-proven acute rejection at 6 months in the patients receiving basiliximab (P=0.023). One-year patient survival was 97.6% with basiliximab and 97.1% with placebo, graft survival was 91.5% versus 88.4%, respectively (NS). The adverse-events profile of patients treated with basiliximab was indistinguishable from that of patients treated with placebo. The number of patients with infections was similar (65.5% for basiliximab vs. 65.7% for placebo), including cytomegalovirus infections (17.3% vs. 14.5%, P=0.245). Nine neoplasms (three in the basiliximab group, six in the placebo arm) were recorded up to 1 year from transplantation. \n                 Basiliximab in combination with cyclosporine, steroids, and azathioprine triple therapy was highly effective in reducing the incidence of acute renal allograft rejection without increasing the incidence of infections and other side effects.'

S'Urodilatin (ANF(95-126)) is an analogue of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF(99-126)), which has been isolated from human urine. Recently we have shown in healthy volunteers, that intravenous bolus injections of synthetic urodilatin produce more pronounced reductions of pulmonary arterial pressure than ANF(99-126). To compare haemodynamic and renal effects of synthetic urodilatin with those of ANF(99-126) in congestive heart failure (CHF), 12 patients (66.3 +/- 1.4 years) received either two high dose intravenous bolus injections of 4 micrograms kg-1 bw Urodilatin (URO) at a 30 min interval (n = 6) or the same doses of ANF(99-126) (n = 6). Prior to i.v. URO, no URO immunoreactivity was found in human plasma (specific RIA, no crossreactivity to ANF). Similar to ANF, the increase in diuresis (1.4 +/- 0.7 to 3.7 +/- 1.6 ml min-1) and natriuresis (169 +/- 114 to 430 +/- 197 mumol min-1) was moderate after URO in CHF. During the 90 min study period, mean plasma cyclic GMP levels increased much more after URO (by 53.4 +/- 15.1 nM) than after ANF (by 13.1 +/- 3.0 nM; P = 0.04). In contrast to ANF, i.v. bolus injections of URO produced sustained haemodynamic effects in CHF lasting up to 90 min: The average (0-90 min) reduction of systemic vascular resistance was more pronounced after URO (-578 +/- 148) than after ANF (-204 +/- 65 dyn*s*cm-5, P = 0.04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)'

S'Sixty unpremedicated ASA physical status I or II patients scheduled for surgical procedures of intermediate duration (15 to 60 min) were studied to evaluate the safety and efficacy of propofol, to measure recovery times and to compare the return of psychomotor and cognitive function with thiopentone. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained by either propofol (2.0-2.5 mg.kg-1 followed by a continuous infusion 0.1-0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1) or thiopentone (4.0-5.0 mg.kg-1, and infusion rate 0.16-0.32 mg.kg-1.min-1), titrated to patient response. Succinylcholine was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation and maintain neuromuscular blockade. Induction of anaesthesia was slightly longer with propofol than thiopentone (42.2 vs 29.8 sec) and was smooth with both drugs. Post-intubation increases in heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were attenuated by propofol when compared with thiopentone. After the administration of propofol, times to eye opening (6.4 +/- 4.3 vs 13.9 +/- 15.9 min), response to verbal command (7.6 +/- 6.3 vs 15.4 +/- 16.6 min) and orientation (22.7 +/- 12.8 vs 36.2 +/- 23.1 min), were significantly shorter. Psychomotor and cognitive function returned earlier with propofol and fewer side effects were noted. At 24 hr there was no distinguishable difference between groups. Propofol is a safe anaesthetic agent with the potential for early patient discharge and street fitness after outpatient procedures.'

We hypothesized that combined administration of vitamin B12 and folate with erythropoietin and iron would enhance erythropoietin-induced erythropoiesis. \n                 In a randomized, controlled trial, 64 premature infants (birth weight: 801-1300 g) receiving erythropoietin and iron supplementation were assigned randomly to receive either vitamin B12 (3 microg/kg per day) and folate (100 microg/kg per day) (treatment group) or a lower dose of folate (60 microg/kg per day) (control group). \n                 During the 4-week observation period, vitamin B12 and folate enhanced erythropoietin-induced erythropoiesis significantly, as indicated by a 10% increase in red blood cell counts, compared with folate alone. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels remained stable in the treatment group, whereas they decreased in the control group. Vitamin B12 levels in the treatment group increased over baseline and control values, whereas red blood cell folate levels were comparable between the groups. Subsequent analysis showed slight nonsignificant differences in baseline red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, hematocrit level, and mean corpuscular volume values, which must be addressed as a limitation. \n                 With the limitation of a slight imbalance in baseline data between the study groups, combined therapy with vitamin B12, folate, erythropoietin, and orally and intravenously administered iron seemed more effective in stimulating erythropoiesis among premature infants, compared with erythropoietin, iron, and low-dose folate alone. Additional trials are necessary to confirm these data.'

S'Among the 566 patients with follicular lymphomas (FL) included in the GELF 86 prospective trials from October 1986 to September 1995, 372 with progressive/relapsing disease were analyzed retrospectively to identify prognostic factors at first relapse. \n                 For progressive FL, patients received mono- (22%) or polychemotherapy (78%) followed by high-dose therapy (HDT) with ASCT for 83 patients (22%). The median time to progression from initial treatment was 23 months (range 3-102 months) and 24% of documented patients (52 of 217) had histological transformation (HT). Salvage therapy produced an overall response in 64% of patients and the five-year survival from progression was 42%. \n                 For patients who underwent HDT with ASCT compared to standard treatment, five-year freedom from second failure was at 42% vs. 16% (P = 0.0001) and five-year survival was 58% vs. 38% (P = 0.0005), respectively. The benefit of HDT and ASCT remained if we consider only patients less than 65 years (five-year survival at 60% vs. 40%; P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis of parameters significant according to univariate analysis found that no ASCT at first progression, age at relapse > 50 years, progression on-therapy were adversely significant on survival. \n                 HDTwith ASCT compared to standard treatment prolonged remission and survival after first progression of FL patients.'

S'Mizolastine is a new, nonsedating antihistamine providing satisfactory symptom relief in allergic conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the onset of hay fever symptoms could be delayed in patients known to suffer seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms if mizolastine was given before the pollen season. This double-blind study involved 342 patients, randomly allocated to once-daily 10 mg mizolastine (n = 115), once-daily 120 mg terfenadine (n = 116), or placebo (n = 111) groups. All patients started treatment on 1 May, before the onset of the grass pollen season. The prophylactic effect of test drugs was assessed on their ability to delay the time to the first hay fever crisis of the season, which was defined by the occurrence of one of the following events: use of rescue medication, study withdrawal because of treatment failure, or total diary symptom score over 18. Active treatments prolonged the time to the first crisis by approximately 1 week (mizolastine 55 days, terfenadine 57 days) in comparison with placebo (50 days) (survival curve analysis: Logrank test, P = 0.01; Wilcoxon test, P = 0.03). Tolerability was satisfactory and comparable between groups. Thus, mizolastine can be safely used to delay and to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis.'

The Promoting Healthy Ageing with Cognitive Exercise (PACE) study has been designed to determine whether a cognitive activity intervention decreases the rate of cognitive decline amongst older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). \n                 The study will recruit 160 community-dwelling men and women aged 65 years of age or over with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Participants will be randomly allocated to two treatment groups: non-specific education and cognitive activity. The intervention will consist of ten 90-minute sessions delivered twice per week over a period of five weeks. The primary outcome measure of the study is the change from baseline in the total score on the Cambridge Cognitive Score (CAMCOG). Secondary outcomes of interest include changes in memory, attention, executive functions, mood and quality of life. Primary endpoints will be collected 12, 52 and 104 weeks after the baseline assessment. \n                 The proposed project will produce the best available evidence on the merits of increased cognitive activity as a strategy to prevent cognitive decline among older adults with MCI.

S"In a study of chemotherapy as palliative treatment, 300 patients with untreated limited and extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC), who did not have progressive disease after the first cycle of chemotherapy, were randomised to receive either regular 'planned' chemotherapy or chemotherapy given 'as required' (AR). All patients received the same chemotherapy: cyclophosphamide 1 gm m-2 i.v., vincristine 2 mg i.v., and etoposide 120 mg m-2 i.v. on day 1, and etoposide 100 mg b.d. orally on days 2 and 3. Planned chemotherapy was given regularly every 3 weeks. AR chemotherapy was given for tumour-related symptoms, or for radiological progression of disease. Both groups of patients were assessed every 3 weeks and a maximum of eight cycles of chemotherapy was given. A detailed quality of life assessment was made using daily diary cards. The median survival (MS) of patients given AR chemotherapy was not significantly worse than those receiving planned treatment [MS: Planned = 36 weeks (95% C.I. 32-40 weeks), AR = 32 weeks (95% C.I. 28-37 weeks) P = 0.960]. In the AR patients the median interval between treatments was 42 days. On average AR patients received half as much chemotherapy as planned patients. AR patients with a treatment-free interval (TFI) of more than 8 weeks between the first and second cycles of chemotherapy survived longer than those in whom this interval was less than 4 weeks; [MS: TFI greater than 8 = 47 weeks (95% C.I. 32-53 weeks); TFI less than 4 = 24 weeks (95% C.I. 17-34 weeks) P = 0.013]. Contrary to expectation, in the quality of life assessment the AR patients scored themselves as having more severe symptoms than patients receiving planned treatment. AR chemotherapy is a novel method of attempting to use cytotoxic drugs palliatively, which resulted in less drug treatment for approximately equivalent survival. However the palliative effect seen with as required treatment was less satisfactory than with planned chemotherapy."

S'The objective of this study was to compare the effects of active abdominal and pectoral generator positions on DFTs in a bidirectional tripolar ICD system. Twenty-five consecutive patients had ICD systems implanted under general anesthesia. A transvenous single lead bipolar defibrillation system and an active 57-cc test emulator in the abdominal and pectoral positions were used in the same patient. A randomized, alternating step-down protocol was used starting at 15 J with 3-J decrements until failure. The mean implantation time was 114 +/- 23 minutes, the mean arrhythmia duration was 14.5 +/- 1.5 seconds, and the mean recovery time was 5.4 +/- 1.1 minutes. The mean DFTs in the abdominal and pectoral positions were 10.9 +/- 5.1 and 9.7 +/- 5.2 J, respectively (NS), the mean intraindividual DFT difference (abdominal minus pectoral) was -0.89 +/- 4.15 J (range -9.5 to 8 J). The 95% confidence interval showed a -2.60 to +0.82 J mean difference (NS). The DFT was < 15 J in 72% and 88% of the patients and the defibrillation impedance was 41 +/- 3 and 44 +/- 3 omega, abdominal versus pectoral positions. There was no difference in DFT between active abdominal and pectoral generator bidirectional tripolar defibrillation. The pectoral position may be considered the primary option, but in cases of high DFTs the abdominal site should be considered an alternative to adding a subcutaneous patch. In some patients, the anatomy may favor an abdominal position. Possible differences in the long-term functionality on the leads are not yet well known and need to be further evaluated.'

S'Endothelial function deteriorates after glucose ingestion. This may be attributed to hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Acute endurance exercise might improve postprandial endothelial function by enhancing glucoregulation and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. \n                 The objective was to determine whether endurance exercise performed 17 h before high-sugar-food ingestion attenuates postprandial impairment in endothelial function. \n                 Healthy men and women (n = 13; age: 48 +/- 17 y) were studied on 2 occasions: after > or = 48 h with no exercise and 17 h after a 60-min bout of endurance exercise. During each trial, brachial artery flow mediated dilation (FMD) was used to assess endothelial function before and after the ingestion of a candy bar and soft drink. Glucose, insulin, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), a marker of oxidative stress, were measured in blood obtained during each FMD measurement. The insulin sensitivity index was calculated from the glucose and insulin data. \n                 FMD decreased significantly after food ingestion in both trials. However, prior exercise shifted the entire FMD curve upward (main treatment effect: P = 0.0002), which resulted in a greater area under the curve for FMD (774 +/- 122%.min) than did no exercise (607 +/- 122%.min) (P = 0.01). Prior exercise shifted the glucose and insulin curves downward (main treatment effects: P = 0.05 and P = 0.0007, respectively) and resulted in a significantly greater insulin sensitivity index (10.8 +/- 0.7) than did no exercise (9.2 +/- 0.7) (P = 0.01). TBARS did not differ significantly between trials. \n                 Postprandial endothelial function was improved by endurance exercise performed approximately 17 h earlier. This effect was accompanied by exercise-induced improvements in insulin action and reductions in glycemia, but did not correspond with reductions in oxidative stress, as assessed by TBARS.'

We tested the efficacy of donepezil in elderly patients with chronic schizophrenia and severe cognitive impairment. \n                 Following baseline assessment, patients were randomly assigned to receive either donepezil or placebo. The dose was 5 mg daily for the first week and 10 mg for an additional 11 weeks. The procedure was repeated using the crossover compound. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) were used to assess the severity of symptoms, cognitive status and intervention effects. \n                 Twenty subjects were enrolled (15 females, five males), mean age 70.2 years (SD 6.5) and mean duration of disease 38.5 years (SD 9.3).

The early PSA test-based variables evaluated were the pretreatment initial PSA (iPSA) value, PSA values at 2 and 4 months into NADT, the PSA nadir (nPSA) value after radiation in all patients, and PSA response signatures in men receiving radiation. Comparisons of endpoints were made using Cox models of local progression-free survival, distant failure-free survival, biochemical failure-free survival, and prostate cancer-specific survival. \n                 The nPSA value was a powerful predictor of all endpoints regardless of whether NADT was given before radiation. PSA response signatures also predicted all endpoints in men treated by radiation alone. iPSA and PSA results at 2 and 4 months into NADT predicted biochemical failure-free survival but not any of the clinical endpoints. nPSA values correlated with those of iPSA, Gleason grade, and T stage and were significantly higher in men receiving radiation alone than in those receiving NADT. \n                 The postradiation nPSA value is the strongest prognostic indicator of all early PSA-based variables. However, its use as a surrogate endpoint needs to take into account its dependence on pretreatment variables and treatment method. \n                 Copyright \xc3\x82\xc2\xa9 2011 Elsevier Inc.

S'Co-dergocrine mesylate (Cod), which inhibits norepinephrine secretion by stimulating presynaptic dopamine receptors, and has no known metabolic side effect, has an additive antihypertensive effect to that of Nifedipine (Nif). Plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, renin activity and aldosterone have been measured after acute administration of Nif and Cod alone and in combination to 18 patients with a diastolic blood pressure greater than 105 mmHg in a cross-over, randomized, double-blind study. Every patient received 4 mg Cod then 20 mg Nif, placebo then 20 mg Nif and 4 mg Cod then placebo. The second treatment was always given 1 h after the first medication. Blood pressure was measured before and every 15 min during the study period. Blood for measurement of catecholamines, aldosterone and renin activity was collected before medication, 1 h after the first dose and 90 min after the second treatment. Blood pressure was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) where Cod preceded Nif. Cod caused a significant decrease in plasma norepinephrine from 293 to 202 pg.ml-1 and in epinephrine from 67 to 55 pg.ml-1. The Nif-induced increase in norepinephrine from a pre-treatment value of 293 pg.ml-1 with preceding Cod to 331 pg.ml-1 was much less than the increase with placebo as premedication, from 284 to 440 pg.ml-1.

S'Leptin is a middle-molecular weight uremic toxin. Hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous reinfusion (HFR) is a novel dialytic method combining the processes of diffusion, convection and adsorption. We performed a prospective crossover study of patients with end-stage renal disease to investigate the effect of HFR therapy on the level of leptin as compared to conventional low flux hemodialysis (LHD). \n                 Eleven stable hemodialysis patients were treated with LHD for 12 weeks and then treated with HFR (SG30 Plus; Sorin Group Italia S.r.1, Mirandola, Italy) for 12 weeks. \n                 After 12 weeks of HFR treatment, serum leptin levels significantly decreased (17.1 (2.66 - 39.5) at Week 12 vs. 12.3 (1.80 - 24.3) ng/ml at Week 24, p = 0.014). Although serum adiponectin levels also decreased (1.66 (1.44 - 1.86) at Week 12 vs. 1.12 (0.79 - 1.34) g/ml at Week 24, p = 0.001), the ratio of leptin to adiponectin did not increase after HFR treatment. Serum beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) levels significantly decreased (37.7 (29.8 - 42.6) at Week 12 vs. 28.3 (26.5 - 32.2) mg/dl at Week 24, p = 0.002). Dry weight, Kt/V(urea), normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance, subjective global assessment, and serum albumin levels of the patients were not changed after HFR treatment. There was no difference in the serum levels of C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 between Week 12 and Week 24. \n                 The results of our study indicate that HFR may be a better therapy than LHD for removal of middle-molecular-weight uremic toxins such as leptin and b2M.'

S'Three clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil in improving or preventing diabetic neural function have either been completed or are currently in progress. In the first study from Seattle and Chicago, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities (NCV) were evaluated in 39 insulin- and noninsulin-dependent, glycemic-stable diabetic patients in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. During the 9 weeks of treatment with 250 mg/d of sorbinil, there was a faster nerve conduction velocity of all 3 nerves tested when compared with the placebo period: peroneal motor NCV (+0.70 +/- 0.24 m/s; means +/- SEM; P less than 0.008), median motor NCV (+0.66 +/- 0.27 m/s; P less than 0.005), and median sensory NCV (+1.16 +/- 0.50 m/s; P less than 0.035). Conduction velocity for all 3 nerves declined significantly within 3 weeks following cessation of the drug. These effects of sorbinil were unrelated to glycemic control, which was constant during the study. Although the effects of sorbinil in improving nerve conduction velocity were small, the findings suggest that the polyol-pathway activity contributes to slowed nerve conduction velocity in diabetics. The second study is a seven-center, double-blind, randomized, 12-month trial of 210 to 280 diabetic patients with clinical signs, symptoms, and objective measurements of neuropathy. The trial has a common-core protocol with end-point evaluations of scored neural signs, symptoms, and neural measurements. Two unique neural tests were designed and validated for use in this trial: thermal and tactile perception thresholds of the fingers and toes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)'

S'Metformin is widely used for treating patients with type 2 diabetes, often as first-line therapy; however, many patients with type 2 diabetes are unable to maintain adequate glycemic control with metformin alone. Vildagliptin, an orally active, potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor, may represent an appropriate antihyperglycemic agent for combination with metformin to improve glycemic control in such patients. This study assessed the effects of coadministration of vildagliptin and metformin on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of each drug. \n                 In this open-label, single-center, randomized, three-period, three-treatment crossover study, 17 patients with type 2 diabetes received vildagliptin 100 mg once daily; metformin 1000 mg once daily; or vildagliptin 100 mg once daily plus metformin 1000 mg once daily. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic sampling were taken frequently on the final day (Day 5) of each treatment period. Lack of pharmacokinetic interaction was defined as the ratio of geometric mean (GMR) and 90% confidence interval (CI) for combination:monotherapy being within the range 0.80-1.25. \n                 Coadministration with metformin had no effect on vildagliptin AUC(0-24) (GMR, 0.94; 90% CI 0.90, 0.99) although there was an 18% decrease in vildagliptin C(max) (GMR 0.82; 90% CI 0.73, 0.91). Coadministration with vildagliptin had no effect on metformin C(max) (GMR 1.04; 90% CI 0.94, 1.16). but caused a 15% increase in AUC(0-24) (GMR 1.15; 90% CI 1.06, 1.25). Both monotherapies and combination therapy were well tolerated. Seven patients reported a total of 10 adverse events; none was serious. \n                 Coadministration of vildagliptin and metformin had a small effect on the pharmacokinetics of each drug in patients with type 2 diabetes; however, this is not likely to be clinically relevant. This small, open-label trial suggests that vildagliptin could be coadministered with metformin without any dose adjustment for either agent.'

Further, patients presenting in stage IV were administered MMC intravenously every 3 months, starting 4 weeks after surgery. The final drug effect evaluations were made in 210 patients excluding 33 dropouts (13.6%). The incidence of side effects was somewhat higher in group B than in group A, but their frequency was low and no serious symptoms were observed. For patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and were carried out curative operation, the 3-year survival rate was significantly higher in group B than in group A.'

S'Pre-clinical studies indicate that changes in progesterone levels across menstrual cycle phases modulate the behavioral effects of sedative drugs acting at GABA(A) receptor sites. In this study, seven healthy women learned to discriminate triazolam (0.25 mg/70 kg) from placebo. After acquiring the discrimination, a range of triazolam doses (0.00, 0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 mg/70 kg) was tested during the early follicular and mid-luteal menstrual cycle phases. During the mid-luteal phase, when progesterone levels were elevated, 0.12 mg/70 kg triazolam was identified as the active triazolam training dose (0.25 mg/70 kg), whereas 0.12 mg/70 kg triazolam was identified as placebo during the early follicular phase, when progesterone levels were low. Triazolam engendered prototypical sedative effects on subjective effect, performance and cardiovascular measures that were generally independent of cycle phase. These results suggest that the discriminative stimulus effects of the positive GABA(A) modulator, triazolam, are sensitive to menstrual cycle phase in healthy adult women.'

At baseline and the end of week 12, 5 mL blood was collected after a 12- to 14-hour fast and plasma fibrinogen concentration, activity of plasma protein C, coagulation factors V, VII, IX, and serum concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), free carnitine, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. \n                 In the carnitine group, mean serum free carnitine concentration increased significantly to 150% of baseline (p < 0.001), whereas plasma fibrinogen and serum CRP had 98 mg/dL (p < 0.01) and 41% (p < 0.01) significant decreases, respectively, at the end of week 12 compared with baseline. The reductions were significant compared with the placebo group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to mean changes of the activity of plasma protein C, coagulation factors V, VII, IX, and serum PAI-1 to tPA ratio. \n                 l-Carnitine supplement reduces serum CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation, and plasma fibrinogen, an inflammation-related coagulation factor, in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, l-carnitine may play an effective role in preventing cardiovascular diseases in these patients.'

S'In an open, randomized, crossover study, the efficacy of sotalol and procainamide was compared in 33 patients with frequent, chronic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). A 75% reduction in PVCs/24 hours (two 24-hour recordings) was arbitrarily considered to constitute an adequate therapeutic effect. Sotalol was started at a dose of 160 mg once daily for 1 week, followed by a 24-hour recording. In the absence of any therapeutic effect, the same procedure was repeated with 320 mg, 480 mg, and 640 mg daily. Procainamide, 1 gm three times/day, was given or, if plasma concentrations were insufficient, 1.5 gm three times/day for 1 week. PVC control was obtained in 22 (67%) patients on sotalol, including all 12 with ischemic heart disease. Procainamide was successful in 13 (39%) patients. Effects on the number of attacks of ventricular tachycardia were achieved by both drugs in those patients where PVCs were reduced by at least 75%. Sotalol caused side effects in five patients, who therefore could not accept planned increases in dosage. Side effects were noted by 12 patients with procainamide. Nine patients responded to both drugs, seven to neither. Thirteen responded to sotalol only and four to procainamide only. We conclude that sotalol is a useful alternative to procainamide in controlling chronic PVCs, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease.'

S'Bites by many species of venomous snake may result in local necrosis at, or extending from, the site of the bite. The use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection as a complication of local necrotic envenoming is controversial. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was carried out to assess whether antibiotic therapy is effective in this situation. Two hundred and fifty-one patients, with proven envenoming by snakes of the genus Bothrops, admitted to two hospitals in Brazil, between 1990 and 1996, were randomized to receive either oral chloramphenicol (500 mg every six hours for five days) or placebo. One hundred and twenty-two of these patients received chloramphenicol (group 1) and 129 were given placebo (group 2). There were no significant differences between the groups at the time of admission. Necrosis developed in seven (5.7%) patients in group 1 and in five (3.9%) patients in group 2 (P>0.05) while abscesses occurred in six patients (4.9%) in group 1 and in six (4.7%) patients in group 2 (P>0.05). In conclusion, the use of orally-administered chloramphenicol for victims of Bothrops snake bite with signs of local envenoming on admission, is not effective for the prevention of local infections.'

S'We have previously shown in an acute inpatient setting that dietary substitution of 77.5% of fat kcal as medium chain triglycerides (MCT) increased insulin-mediated glucose metabolism in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and that this effect appeared to be mediated by increases in insulin-mediated glucose disposal. The purpose of this study was to test the application of dietary substitution of medium chain triglycerides as an adjunctive tool in ambulatory therapy of NIDDM. \n                 Five subjects with NIDDM underwent a baseline 6 hour insulin/glucose euglycemic clamp study, with simultaneous 3H-glucose infusion for calculation of glucose disposal rate and hepatic glucose output. Subjects were then randomized to begin one of two 30-day experimental diets, with long chain (LCT) or medium chain triglycerides (MCT), and subsequent crossover to the other diet. A 6 hour euglycemic clamp was repeated after each diet phase. \n                 Diet records and urinary organic acid excretion indicated a high level of dietary compliance by the study participants. Postprandial blood glucose excursions were less after one month on the diet with MCT than after the LCT diet (p = 0.004). However, fasting serum glucose, serum fructosamine (a measure of glycemia), fasting insulin, hepatic glucose output, and insulin-mediated glucose metabolism were not improved by the dietary substitution of MCT. \n                 These data indicate that supplementation of a tolerable amount of MCT in a conventional diabetic exchange diet has little impact on glycemic control in subjects with NIDDM in an ambulatory setting.'

S'To evaluate the role of serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) as a biochemical marker for disease activity assessment and drug monitoring in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with cyclical etidronate. \n                 Forty patients (35 women and 5 men) with RA of <5 years duration were randomized to receive intermittent cyclical etidronate therapy in conjunction with anti-rheumatic therapy or anti-rheumatic therapy alone (without etidronate) in a 2-year, open-label protocol. \n                 Radiographs of hands and feet and serum samples for the determination of OPG, amino terminal propeptide (PINP), cross-linked C-telopeptide (ICTP) and amino terminal telopeptid of type I collagen were obtained at baseline and at 24 months. \n                 Etidronate treatment had no effect on circulating OPG levels, although the significant decline in PINP and ICTP (P=0.001 and P=0.04 respectively) reflected the efficacy of the anti-resorptive therapy. At baseline and at study termination, serum OPG correlated significantly with age (r=0.45; P=0.003 and r=0.56; P=0.0002 respectively). OPG was not related to biochemical markers of bone metabolism, indices of disease activity or radiographic disease progression. At baseline, the mean serum OPG was higher in patients receiving 5-10 mg/day prednisone (82.8+/-4.0 pg/ml, n=16) compared with those receiving <5 mg/day or with no prednisone (69.7+/-4.7 pg/ml, n=23) (P=0.05). \n                 Our results suggested that serum OPG measurement, perhaps because of the complexity of the regulation of the OPG, may be difficult to utilize in the evaluation of anti-resorptive therapy. Moreover, low dose corticosteroid-associated osteoporosis is probably not mediated by inhibition of OPG.'

S'This double-blind study compares the effects of tibric acid at four different doses to that of placebo in type IV hyperlipidemic patients. Fifty patients, divided at random in five groups of 10 patients each, received one of the following treatments: placebo, tibric acid 500 mg, 750 mg, 1,000 mg, or 1,250 mg per 24 hr. The data suggest that the 1,000 mg and the 1,250 mg doses are effective in lowering the serum triglyceride levels after 6 wk of treatment; the effect on total cholesterol is less pronouced. No effect is observed on the concentration of serum esterified cholesterol, phospholipids, and free fatty acids. It is also shown that in the dose range studied, the best fitting curve defining the four mean values of triglycerides and total cholesterol obtained with the four active treatments did not deviate significantly from linearity. Due to lack of toxicity, tibric acid may be useful in the treatment of type IV hyperlipoproteinemia.'

The response rate was 68.8 %. Bivariate and multivariate associations between socio-economic variables, need (evaluated and perceived health status), social support and the number of consultations (general practitioners or internists) were assessed.

Individuals living in a partnership showed lower levels of utilisation (median: 4.3 vs. 6.2). The combination of high morbidity and low social support or no partnership results in an increase in medical services utilisation. \n                 Social support treatments that target an appropriate use of the health care system can be a cost-effective measure in chronically ill patients.'

Changes of blood beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-M), hemoglobin (Hb), 24 h urinary protein (24 h UP), pH value of urine and blood uric acid (BUA) as well as kidney function were observed. \n                 After treatment, level of beta(2)-M got lowered significantly, Hb and 24 h UP, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and the clearance rate of creatinine, as well as blood lipids all improved obviously in the treated group (all P<0.01), while these parameters remained unchanged in the control group (P>0.05). The pH value of urine was improved in both groups showing an insignificant difference between them (P>0.05). BUA was decreased in both groups with a decrease to a larger extent in the treated group (P<0.01). The total effective rate was 87% in the treated group, which was superior to that in the control group (62%, P<0.05). \n                 WCC has a favorable therapeutic effect on gout and its mechanism of action for improving renal function and reducing urinary protein could be related with the lowering of blood beta(2)-M, BUA and lipids.'

The study is based on research examining natural recovery processes with alcohol abusers and on clinical trials using a Guided Self-Change model of treatment with problem drinkers. Advertisements and mailed pamphlets are used to solicit individuals who wanted to change their drinking on their own using self-help materials. Respondents are screened and, if eligible, are randomly assigned to two conditions: Guided Self-Change (GSC) or Educational Materials Control (EMC) (projected N = 788): All subjects complete and mail in several brief assessment forms. Subjects in the GSC group receive advice and personalized feedback based on their assessment answers. Subjects in the EMC group receive educational pamphlets prepared for general medical and mental health settings. Subject characteristics and drinking-related history variables for the first 10% of the sample are presented. Subjects will be followed up at 12 months following the intervention.'

S'In a previous study we showed that moderate to severe stress during pregnancy was inversely related to infant birth weight. Using the same criteria for stress (according to the Social Readjustment Rating Scale of Holmes and Rahe), we studied 86 white mothers with singleton pregnancies and with no known medical or obstetric risk factors for reduced birth weight. After strict randomization, data were analyzed for 43 mothers who received psychosocial support between enrollment at +/- 20 weeks and delivery at +/- 38 weeks and for 43 control mothers who received standard care at the antenatal clinic. In the supported group seven infants weighed less than 3000 gm at birth versus 18 control infants (p = 0.008), and analysis revealed that this effect was more the result of improved intrauterine growth than of prolongation of pregnancy. These findings are of little clinical relevance as far as the neonate is concerned, but they do indicate that psychosocial support has a significant effect on birth weight. It is possible that previous studies that have looked only for an effect on low- or very-low-birth-weight rates might have missed this clinically measurable benefit of counseling.'

S'Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant used in transplantation. It has been shown to have a comparable therapeutic effect and a low adverse drug reaction profile relative to cyclosporme. \n                 The present study compared the pharmacokinetics of twice-daily doses of 2 tacrolimus formulations used in clinical practice in Korea: a conventional (reference) formulation and a more recently developed (test) formulation. The bioavailability of the 2 formulations was evaluated based on the requirement of 20% deviation at a power of 80%. \n                 This study had a randomized, open-label, 2-period, crossover, non-inferiority design. There was a 96-hour treatment period for each formulation, with a 3-week washout period between formulations. Each healthy adult subject received two 1-mg capsules of the reference or test formulation of tacrolimus twice daily (morning and evening), for a total daily dose of 4 mg. Blood samples were obtained during the 96-hour period after the first dose in each treatment period, with tolerability assessments performed up to 2 weeks after the first dose in each period. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters were C(max) and AUC from time 0 to the last measured concentration and extrapolated to infinity. Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters were T(max), t(1/2), C(min0-24), AUC(0-24), and C(96). \n                 The study enrolled 29 healthy Korean volunteers (22 men, 7 women; mean [SD] age, 29 [7] years; age range, 20-51 years; mean weight, 66 [10] kg; mean height, [171 17] cm). All volunteers completed both treatment periods. The 90% Cls for the ratios of the pharmacokinetic parameters (test:reference drug) were 119.25-161.29 for C(max), 95.29-129.04 for AUC(0-t), and 95.63-131.42 for AUC(0-infinity). Based on the 80% to 125% bioequivalence criterion, these results indicated that pharmacokinetic exposure to the test drug was not inferior to that of the reference drug. Both formulations were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported. \n                 In these healthy Korean adults, there were no statistically significant differences between the pharmacokinetic parameters of the more recently developed oral formulation of tacrolimus and the conventional formulation.'

Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a novel IV iron formulation designed to permit larger infusions compared to currently available IV standards such as Venofer(R) (iron sucrose). \n                 The primary objective of REPAIR-IDA is to estimate the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of FCM (two doses at 15 mg/kg to a maximum of 750 mg per dose) compared to Venofer(R) (1000 mg administered as five infusions of 200 mg) in subjects who have IDA and NDD-CKD. REPAIR-IDA is a multi-centre, randomized, active-controlled, open-label study. Eligible patients must have haemoglobin (Hgb) < or = 11.5 g/dL and CKD defined as (1) GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) on two occasions or (2) GFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and either evidence of renal injury by urinalysis or elevated Framingham cardiovascular risk score. Two thousand and five hundred patients will be randomized to FCM or Venofer(R) in a 1:1 ratio. The primary efficacy endpoint is mean change in Hgb from baseline to the highest observed Hgb between baseline and Day 56. The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects experiencing at least one of the following events: death due to any cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization or medical intervention, arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension during the 120 days following randomization. \n                 REPAIR-IDA will assess the efficacy and safety of two 750-mg infusions of FCM compared to an FDA-approved IV iron regimen in patients with NDD-CKD at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.'

S'Weight reduction induces bone loss by several factors, and the effect of higher protein (HP) intake during caloric restriction on bone mineral density (BMD) is not known. Previous study designs examining the longer-term effects of HP diets have not controlled for total calcium intake between groups and have not examined the relationship between bone and endocrine changes. In this randomized, controlled study, we examined how BMD (areal and volumetric), turnover markers, and hormones [insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and estradiol] respond to caloric restriction during a 1-year trial using two levels of protein intake. Forty-seven postmenopausal women (58.0 \xc2\xb1 4.4 years; body mass index of 32.1 \xc2\xb1 4.6 kg/m(2) ) completed the 1-year weight-loss trial and were on a higher (HP, 24%, n = 26) or normal protein (NP, 18%, n = 21) and fat intake (28%) with controlled calcium intake of 1.2 g/d. After 1 year, subjects lost 7.0% \xc2\xb1 4.5% of body weight, and protein intake was 86 and 60 g/d in the HP and NP groups, respectively. HP compared with NP diet attenuated loss of BMD at the ultradistal radius, lumbar spine, and total hip and trabecular volumetric BMD and bone mineral content of the tibia. This is consistent with the higher final values of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 and lower bone-resorption marker (deoxypyridinoline) in the HP group than in the NP group (p <\xe2\x80\x89.05). These data show that a higher dietary protein during weight reduction increases serum IGF-1 and attenuates total and trabecular bone loss at certain sites in postmenopausal women. \n                 Copyright \xc2\xa9 2011 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.'

S'There is considerable evidence that serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists modulate some of the behavioral effects of alcohol, and may decrease alcohol consumption. To better clarify the mechanism of action of 5-HT3 antagonists on these behaviors, we investigated the effects of the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron, on several subjective and objective measures of alcohol intoxication in social drinkers. Twelve nonalcoholic, social drinkers received either 8 mg ondansetron, p.o., or placebo during one of two test sessions in a crossover, double-blind protocol. Both conditions were followed by a standard, intoxicating dose of alcohol. Subjective and objective measures of intoxication including mood, physical sensations, performance changes, and alcohol pharmacokinetics were determined. To control for ondansetron effects, 10 additional subjects received either ondansetron or placebo, followed by a nonintoxicating, "placebo" dose of alcohol during a second crossover double-blind protocol. Ondansetron was found to augment certain stimulant, sedative, and discriminant effects of alcohol, without affecting psychomotor performance or alcohol pharmacokinetics. Ondansetron had minimal effects on subjects receiving placebo alcohol. These data suggest that the reductions in alcohol consumption observed in animals and humans treated with ondansetron may be mediated by increases in subjective intoxication, and/or increases in the aversive effects of alcohol.'

Two puffs, one in each nostril, was taken as an initial dose (resulting in either 0.5 or 1 mg of DHE), followed by another puff (0.5 mg) after 30 and 60 minutes, if necessary, achieving a maximum dose of 2 mg for patients of the DHE 1-mg group or of 1.5 mg for patients of the 0.5-mg group. Four consecutive attacks were thus treated. The efficacy analysis was done for observed cases. The main outcome measure was reduction of the severity of the attacks. \n                 No differences were observed in the migraine characteristics or the number of treatments of the patients from the different groups. Dihydroergotamine 1 mg tended to provide better relief than 0.5 mg, although the effect was not statistically significant. Patients taking DHE used less rescue medications, with a dose-dependent effect. Side effects were reported by four patients receiving DHE but not placebo. The tolerability of the drug was assessed as good by 94% of the patients. \n                 These findings suggest that DHE nasal spray is well tolerated and has dose-dependent efficacy in migraine.'

S'Haemodialysis (HD)-induced bio-incompatibility includes alterations in both cellular elements and humoral factors. As far as polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells are concerned, an increase in both adhesion and degranulation has been reported. However, whereas increased PMN adherence and aggregation is highly linked with early transient complement activation, degranulation seems a continuous process, independent from the formation of complement degradation products. In the process of cell activation, including PMN degranulation, divalent cations (Ca2+) appear to play a pivotal role. As regionally administering citrate creates an almost Ca(2+)-free environment within the dialyser, it is tempting to speculate that Ca2+ dependent phenomena of bio-incompatibility, originating within the dialyser, can be attenuated by substituting conventional heparin for citrate. \n                 Therefore, both anticoagulation modalities were compared in 10 stable patients, undergoing haemodialysis (HD) treatment with cellulose-triacetate membranes (CTA) only. Apart from the intracellular granule products myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoferrin (LF), the classical parameters of bio-incompatibility, peripheral blood neutropenia and complement activation, were measured. \n                 Analysis of MPO and LF gradients across the dialyser (concentration in efferent line-concentration in afferent line) suggested that degranulation is an early process, that occurs mainly within the extracorporeal circuit. Citrate abolished the release of MPO almost completely, whereas LF release was partially inhibited. Neither neutropenia, nor complement activation could be correlated with the occurrence of degranulation. \n                 HD-induced PMN degranulation seems largely independent from complement activation, but primarily reliant on Ca2+, at least in the case of CTA membranes.'

Anesthesia was induced with remifentanil and rocuronium at a dosage of 0.6 mg x kg(-1), and neuromuscular function was monitored by means of acceleromyography. After randomization, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane or with propofol for total intravenous anesthesia. Patients in both groups also received an infusion of remifentanil for analgesia and rocuronium to maintain a block of greater than 90%. After surgery, sugammadex was administered at a dosage of 2 mg x kg(-1) on reappearance of the second train-of-four (TOF) twitch (T2) and the times until recovery of T4/T1 ratios of 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 (main endpoints). Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded at baseline and after 2, 5, 10, and 30 minutes (secondary outcome measures). \n                 Although less rocuronium was consumed in the sevoflurane group than in the propofol group and the time between the start of sugammadex administration until recovery of a TOF ratio of 0.9 was shorter for the sevoflurane group than for propofol group (mean [SD], 1.46 [0.30] minutes and 1.89 [0.62] minutes, respectively), these differences were not significant. No signs of recurarization or associated adverse effects were observed. \n                 Sugammadex effectively and safely reverses a rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in less than 2 minutes in long-duration surgery performed under both inhaled and intravenous anesthesia. The interaction of neuromuscular blocking agents with sevoflurane appears not to affect the reversal time of sugammadex in such operations.'

S'We examined the relationship between naturally occurring changes in physical activity and depressive symptoms across a 2-year period among adolescent boys and girls. \n                 Participants (N = 4594) reported their frequency of physical activity outside of school and completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale in the Fall of 1998 (beginning of 7th grade; baseline data), Spring of 1999 (end of 7th grade; interim data), and Spring of 2000 (end of 8th grade; follow-up data). \n                 Latent growth modeling indicated that a 1 SD unit change in the frequency of leisure-time physical activity was inversely related to a.25 SD unit change in depressive symptoms. This relationship was attenuated but remained statistically significant when simultaneously controlling for the confounding variables of sex, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol consumption, and the value participants placed on their health, appearance, and achievement. \n                 Naturally occurring changes in physical activity were negatively related with changes in depressive symptoms. The results encourage randomized controlled trials to experimentally determine whether an increase in physical activity reduces depression risk among adolescent boys and girls.'

S"Fatigue is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), occurring in up to 42% of patients (2). There is no recognized treatment. This is a study of modafinil for Parkinson's disease related fatigue. Ethical approval was given. Patients with idiopathic PD were recruited from a Movement Disorders clinic. Those with depression, dementia, and other causes for fatigue were excluded. Patients were assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), self-rating of improvement, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and UPDRS. Modafinil was titrated up over 4 weeks to maximum of 400 mg/day. There followed a 5 week maintenance phase before reassessment. Thirteen patients participated. No significant change was seen in any safety measure. The FSS did not change significantly, however those on modafinil rated an improvement in their fatigue compared to placebo. The Modafinil group had a statistically significant improvement on ESS (p < 0.05). This is a small study of modafinil in selected PD patients. There is a suggestion of improvement on the global clinical impression scale for fatigue, but no significant change on FSS. A larger study is needed to further evaluate this drug in PD fatigue. This study highlights the problems with recruitment when trialing treatments of non-motor symptoms in PD. A significant improvement in EDS was seen."

S"To investigate the influence of genotypic resistance-guided HIV-treatment decisions on long-term clinical and virological outcomes in patients failing antiretroviral therapy by a prospective 30-month observation following a 6-month randomized study (Argenta trial). \n                 Patients (n=174) with virological failure on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were initially randomized (1:1) to receive empirical therapy or guidance by genotypic resistance results. After month 6, all patients with HIV RNA >1,000 copies/ml received genotypic resistance tests and expert advice. Predictors of virological and clinical outcomes were analysed by logistic regression and Cox's regression models. Results: There was a gradual increase in the proportion of patients with HIV RNA <400 copies/ml with 29.3% at 36 months (intent-to-treat) without differences between initial randomization arms. Independent predictors of 36-month virological response were the use of a salvage therapy with less daily doses and a more pronounced 3-month viral load drop. At 36 months, 84% survived without new AIDS events/death. Independent predictors of new AIDS events/death were previous AIDS events, higher baseline viral load, less pronounced 3-month viral load drop and, in a separate model, baseline protease substitutions K20M/R and 184V. \n                 The virological benefit of genotype-guided treatment decisions was continuously appreciable over time. Short-term virological response and viral cross-resistance were independent predictors of long-term outcomes."

S'To observe the therapeutic effect of acupuncture therapy for aura-absence migraine. \n                 A total of 60 aura-absence migraine outpatients who signed an informed consent participated in the present study. They were randomized into medication group and acupuncture group (n = 30/group) according to a randomized number table and their visiting sequence. Patients of acupuncture group were treated by acupuncture of Ashi-point, Baihui (GV 20), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Shuaigu (GB 8), Fengchi (GB 20), Benshen (GB 13) and Lieque (LU 7). The acupuncture needles were retained for 30 min after "Deqi", and the treatment was conducted once daily, 6 times every week and continuously for 4 weeks. Patients of the medication group were treated with oral administration of Flunarizine (10 mg/time, once every night) for 4 weeks. The SF-36 Quality-of-Life Instrument (SF-36) and integral scores of headache were measured before and after the treatment. \n                 In comparison with the pre-treatment, scores of physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), vitality (VT), mental-health (MH) and general health (GH) of SF-36 in both medication and acupuncture groups were increased significantly (P < 0.05), and those of PF, RP and BP of the acupuncture group were significantly higher than the scores of the medication group (P < 0.05). The integral scores of headache were decreased significantly in both medication group and acupuncture group (P < 0.05), and those of the acupuncture group were remarkably lower than the scores of the medication group after the treatment (P < 0.05). Of the two 30 migraine patients in the medication and acupuncture groups, 1 (3.33%) and 9 (30.00%) were cured, 1 (3.33%) and 2 (6.67%) had a marked improvement in their symptoms, 9 (30.00%) and 8 (26.67%) were effective, 19 (63. 33%) and 11 (36.67%) were ineffective, with the total effective rates being 36.67% and 63.33%, respectively. The cure rate and the total effective rate of the acupuncture group were significantly higher than those of the medication group (P < 0.05). \n                 Acupuncture therapy can raise the migraineurs\' life quality, lessen the times and severity of headache attack, and its therapeutic effect is superior to that of medication.'

S'Impaired skin integrity in patients with Netherton syndrome (NS) results in significant systemic absorption of topically applied medications. Some have advocated the administration of pimecrolimus, 1%, topical cream for the treatment of patients with NS. Insufficient data exist with regard to its safety, systemic absorption, and efficacy. \n                 An exploratory study was conducted involving 3 children with NS who received twice-daily application of pimecrolimus, 1%, cream over 18 months. There were no notable abnormalities in hematologic or chemistry profiles. Blood levels of pimecrolimus ranged from 0.625 to 7.08 ng/mL, with peak levels reached during the first month in all 3 patients. Dramatic reductions were observed in the Netherton Area and Severity Assessment, Eczema Area and Severity Index, Investigator Global Evaluation of Disease, and pruritus scores compared with baseline levels. \n                 Use of pimecrolimus, 1%, cream was well tolerated and demonstrated marked improvements in nearly all of the parameters evaluated. Patients treated with pimecrolimus responded rapidly, within the first month of treatment, and improvement persisted throughout the study period. In adult patients receiving oral pimecrolimus, blood levels as high as 54 ng/mL for 3 months have not shown clinically significant immunosuppression. Absorption of pimecrolimus, 1%, cream was detectable, but levels were much lower than expected even when applied to 50% of total body surface area. Larger studies are warranted to determine the safety and efficacy of pimecrolimus, 1%, cream in the treatment of NS. \n                 clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00208026.'

At the end of the placebo wash-out and of each treatment period, office BP, total cholesterol, PAI-1, and t-PA activity were evaluated. \n                 The amlodipine-atorvastatin combination, in addition to the expected hypocholesterolemic effect, produced: 1) a greater decrease in PAI-1 activity (-10.2 U/mL, P <.01 v placebo) and an even greater increase in t-PA activity (+0.26 U/mL, P <.01 v placebo) than amlodipine (-0.5 U/mL for PAI-1, P = not significant; +0.17 U/mL for t-PA, P <.01 v placebo) and atorvastatin alone (respectively, -9.9 U/mL, P <.01 v placebo and +0.08 U/mL, P <.05 v placebo); and 2) a greater systolic BP/diastolic BP mean reduction (-22/17 mm Hg, P <.005 v placebo) than amlodipine (-18/14 mm Hg, P <.01 v placebo) and atorvastatin alone (-2.8/3.8 mm Hg, P <.05 v placebo only for diastolic BP). \n                 The positive effect on fibrinolytic balance and BP control observed suggests that in hypertensive, hypercholesterolemic patients with impaired fibrinolysis, the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin could be the treatment of choice. \n                 Copyright 2004 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.'

S'This study examined the effect of deception of distance end-point on prolonged cycling performance. 21 subjects were randomly allocated to three groups (n = 7 per group). Each group completed three self-paced time-trials separated by one day. Subjects were told that each trial was a 30-km time-trial and were required to complete the distance in the fastest time possible. Following the initial trial of 30 km, one group completed Trial 2 with a longer distance (long distance group; 36 km), another group with a shorter distance (24 km; short distance group), and the third group as control (30 km; control). Each group then completed a third time-trial of 30 km. At no time was the deception of distance in Trial 2 disclosed to the subjects, and all sources of physiological and mechanical feedback were withheld during the trials. Data from Trials 1 and 3 were analysed by repeated-measures analysis of covariance. Time to complete Trial 1 was similar among groups (approximately 65 min.). Following the deception in Trial 2 the time to complete the 30 km in Trial 3 was increased for the short distance group, decreased for the long distance group, whilst the time for the control group remained unchanged. The times to complete the 30 km on Trials 1 and 3 were matched by changes in power output throughout the trials. It is concluded that subjects deceived of the actual distance completed will complete the subsequent performance trial based on perceived effort rather than on actual distance.'

S'Previous studies have reported health utilities for migraine patients as generally measured between migraine attacks, but health utility data for within a migraine attack are unavailable. We evaluated within-attack health utilities among acute migraine patients experiencing different grades of headache severity. \n                 We examined data for 330 20-65-year-old adults, in good physical health, who had 1-6 moderate/severe migraine attacks per month in the 2 months prior to the screening visit. Data were collected from a multicenter, double-blind study of a treatment for acute migraine in the United States. The EQ-5D system was used to measure generic health status at baseline and 24 h post-treatment within an acute migraine attack, and patients were also asked to rate their pain level at these time points (no, mild, moderate, or severe pain). The D1 time-trade-off scoring algorithm for the U.S. population was applied. Confidence intervals were estimated by bootstrap methods. \n                 The study population was 88% women and 78% white ethnicity, with 60% of subjects over age 40. The disutility of mild migraine pain was estimated to be 0.140 (95% CI: 0.0848, 0.1940), with a disutility for moderate migraine pain of 0.186 (95% CI: 0.1645, 0.2053) and for severe migraine pain of 0.493 (95% CI: 0.4100, 0.5654). \n                 Within-attack disutilities estimated for migraine in this study are much greater than those reported for migraine when evaluated as a chronic health condition (e.g., valuations collected at random time points). These data can be of value in adapting results from clinical trials of migraine interventions to cost-utility policy analyses.'

S'Cisapride is a substituted piperidinyl benzamide indicated for the symptomatic treatment of patients with nocturnal heartburn due to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The currently recommended dosing regimen for cisapride is 10 mg q.d.s., but the elimination half-life of 8-10 h supports b.d. dosing with 20 mg. \n                 This multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to determine the efficacy and safety of cisapride 20 mg b.d. dosing in reducing or preventing heartburn and other meal-related symptoms after challenge with a provocative fatty meal. In phase 1 of the study, 137 patients with at least a 3-month history of symptoms suggestive of GERD and at least five episodes of GERD on 7-day diary were eligible to receive single-blind treatment with placebo for 7 (range +/- 3) days and then ingested a provocative meal. One hundred and twenty-two patients (45 men and 77 women, 22-65 years of age) who experienced heartburn during the 3 h after ingestion of the meal qualified for the double-blind phase of the study and were randomly assigned to either cisapride 20 mg or matching placebo b.d. for 7 (+/-3) days. At the end of this period, 118 patients again ate a fatty meal and were assessed for symptoms of GERD. \n                 Heartburn was prevented in a significantly higher percentage of cisapride-treated patients (40%; 24 out of 60) than placebo-treated patients (21%; 12 out of 58) after the repeat provocative meal at the end of the double-blind phase (P = 0.017). Cisapride was also significantly more effective in reducing the severity of postprandial heartburn, belching, and regurgitation (P < 0.05). Twice-daily dosing with cisapride 20 mg was well tolerated; the number of cisapride- and placebo-treated patients who experienced at least one adverse event was similar (31% and 22%, respectively). The most common adverse events were diarrhoea (cisapride, 18%; placebo, 0%) and rhinitis (cisapride, 2%; placebo, 5%). \n                 These results demonstrate that cisapride 20 mg b.d. is effective in preventing or reducing symptoms of heartburn in patients who developed heartburn after ingesting a provocative fatty meal. Cisapride was also effective in reducing the severity of heartburn-related symptoms such as belching and regurgitation.'

S"Nalbuphine, a mixed micro-/kappa-opioid analgesic, may have potential as a new medication for the treatment of cocaine abuse. Kappa-opioid agonists functionally antagonize some abuse-related and locomotor effects of cocaine, and both kappa-selective and mixed micro-/kappa-opioids reduce cocaine self-administration by rhesus monkeys. Because cocaine's interactions with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and (HPA) hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes may contribute to its reinforcing properties, we examined the effects of cocaine alone and in combination with nalbuphine. Neuroendocrine effects of a single dose of cocaine alone (0.2 mg/kg, IV), with nalbuphine (5 mg/70 kg, IV)+cocaine (0.2 mg/kg, IV) in combination were compared in seven adult men (ages 18-35) who met DSM-IV criteria for current cocaine abuse. Cocaine alone, and in combination with nalbuphine was administered on separate test days under placebo-controlled, double blind conditions. Cocaine stimulated ACTH, cortisol, and LH, whereas cocaine+nalbuphine in combination produced a smaller increase in ACTH, and decreased cortisol and LH. Thus it appears that nalbuphine attenuated cocaine's effects on ACTH, cortisol, and LH. These data are consistent with our earlier report that nalbuphine modestly attenuated cocaine's positive subjective effects, and that the subjective and cardiovascular effects of cocaine+nalbuphine in combination were not additive."

The 3-week vacation program included 12 moderate- intensity guided hiking tours [4 times/week, 55-65% heart rate maximum (HRmax)] with a total exercise time of 29 h plus moderate recreational activities. Both study groups had a comparable and balanced nutrition with no specific dietary restrictions. Anthropometric, metabolic and cardiovascular parameters were measured 10-14 days before vacation, several times during the 3-week vacation, 7-10 days and 6-8 weeks after return. All participants tolerated the vacation without any adverse effects. Body weight, body fat, waist-circumference, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), plasma fibrinogen, resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly decreased over time in both study groups. In the LA group, fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-index were significantly decreased one week after return. Relative cycle ergometry performance was significantly increased after return compared to baseline. In both study groups, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides remained unchanged. The 3-week vacation intervention at moderate and LA had a positive influence on all key-markers of the metabolic syndrome. No clinically relevant differences could be detected between the study groups. A hiking vacation at moderate and LA can be recommended for people with stable, controlled metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors."

S"A double blind trial was conducted in seven centres to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cimetidine 800 mg given at night compared with 400 mg given at breakfast and at bedtime. Altogether 197 patients with active duodenal ulcer confirmed by endoscopy entered the study, of whom 187 were eligible for analysis. After four weeks' treatment the ulcer was healed in 76 of 91 patients (84%) receiving the once daily regimen and in 65 of the 96 patients (68%) receiving the twice daily regimen (p less than 0.05). Both dosage regimens were equally effective in reducing ulcer pain and consumption of antacids. Pain relief was considerable within the first two weeks, and most of the patients were free of symptoms by the end of treatment. No patients were withdrawn because of adverse events as these were few and mild, consistent with the proved safety profile of cimetidine. Cimetidine 800 mg given at night is as effective as 400 mg twice daily; the single dose regimen may improve patient compliance, thus facilitating treatment."

S'Since it is unclear whether methotrexate and cytarabine are synergistic or antagonistic in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the Pediatric Oncology Group studied the prognostic significance of a potential interaction between these agents. RBC methotrexate concentrations were compared from 140 patients at lower risk of relapse randomized to two treatment groups: one receiving six methotrexate infusions with overlapping cytarabine; the other, six methotrexate infusions alone. Samples from 248 patients from all risk groups were studied to determine whether patients with extremely low RBC methotrexate concentrations had inferior outcomes. Among low-risk patients studied 3 weeks after the sixth infusion, median RBC methotrexate concentrations were 0.13 nmol/ml RBCs (n = 71) for the methotrexate-only group and 0.02 nmol/ml RBCs (n = 69) for the methotrexate/cytarabine-treated low-risk patients, P < 0.001 by the two-sided Wilcoxon test. For low- and high-risk patients receiving methotrexate/cytarabine infusions, event-free survival at 1 and 3 years after RBC sampling was 97 +/- 2% and 90 +/- 3% for patients with concentrations greater than the median, and 88 +/- 3% and 78 +/- 4% for those with concentrations at or below the median. Log rank comparisons of event-free survival in the first year and overall yielded P = 0.005 and P = 0.04, respectively. Cytarabine altered methotrexate pharmacology when the drugs were infused together. Patients whose levels were extremely low had an adverse prognosis. Although this study could not assess efficacy of the methotrexate/cytarabine combination, it appears that concurrent administration is not optimal.'

S'The cardiac regulation effects of a mental task added to regular office work are described. More insight into the time evolution during the different tasks is created by using time-frequency analysis (TFA). Continuous wavelet transformation was applied to create time series of instantaneous power and frequency in specified frequency bands (LF 0.04-0.15 Hz; HF 0.15-0.4 Hz), in addition to the traditional linear heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. In a laboratory environment, 43 subjects underwent a protocol with three active conditions: a clicking task with low mental load and a clicking task with high mental load (mental arithmetic) performed twice, each followed by a rest condition. The heart rate and measures related to vagal modulation could differentiate the active conditions from the rest condition, meaning that HRV is sensitive to any change in mental or physical state. Differences between physical and mental stress were observed and a higher load in the combined task was observed. Mental stress decreased HF power and caused a shift toward a higher instantaneous frequency in the HF band. TFA revealed habituation to the mental load within the task (after 3 min) and between the two tasks with mental load. In conclusion, the use of TFA in this type of analysis is important as it reveals extra information. The addition of a mental load to a physical task elicited further effect on HRV parameters related to autonomic cardiac modulation.'

Incision design was triplanar and required suture closure, i.e., all wounds were closed with two X-pattern 10-0 nylon sutures. Using the Cravy method, an insignificant difference in induced astigmatism was found between the groups at one day, two weeks, and one year after surgery. The average induced diopters of astigmatism for the 4.0 mm group was +0.80 +/- 0.94 at one day, +0.49 +/- 0.73 at two weeks, and -0.34 +/- 0.91 at one year; for the 5.5 mm group it was +0.69 +/- 1.07 at one day, +0.41 +/- 0.85 at two weeks, and -0.23 +/- 1.01 at one year. Two-week uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better was similar for both groups. Seventy-six percent of the 4.0 mm group and 68% of the 5.5 mm group had acuities of 20/40 or better.

Blood lactate concentration (10.7 (3.0) v 10.6 (4.3) mmol/l) did not differ between the TT and FT. \n                 Although cardiorespiratory variables were not different at submaximal intensities between the two tests, VO2max values derived from laboratory measurements were underestimated. Using field testing in addition to treadmill testing provides a better measurement of a player's individual fitness level and may be routinely used to accurately prescribe appropriate aerobic exercise training."

The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points included 6-month and 1-year survival rates, progression-free survival, response rate, safety, and quality of life. \n                 Six hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two treatment arms. No statistically significant differences in survival parameters were observed. The median overall survival for the experimental arm was 193 v 182 days for the control arm (P =.75); 6-month and 1-year survival rates were 53% and 27% v 49% and 24% for the control arm, respectively; median progression-free survival was 112 v 109 days for the control arm. Ten drug-related deaths were reported for the experimental arm and seven for the control arm. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade > or = 3 were observed in 40% and 15% in the experimental arm versus 30% and 12% in the control arm. Incidences of nonhematologic adverse events were similar in two groups. \n                 The combination of gemcitabine and tipifarnib has an acceptable toxicity profile but does not prolong overall survival in advanced pancreatic cancer compared with single-agent gemcitabine.'

S'121 patients with advanced ovarian cancer resistant to or relapsing following platinum-based chemotherapy participated in this prospective randomised multicenter study. The second-line treatment was indicated according to the relapse-free interval. 36 assessable patients were resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy or relapsed within 12 months following primary surgery. This group of patients with early relapse was randomized to oral or parenteral etoposide. 82 patients relapsed within an interval longer then 12 months following primary surgery; these patients with delayed relapse underwent a secondary tumour-debulking surgery. The data of this group of patients with delayed relapse will be published as soon as the time of observation allows adequate results. In this paper the efficiency of etoposide in the patients with early relapse is analysed according to the application form of the drug (oral vs. parenteral). No statistically significant difference in response rate, toxicity, and median survival time was found between the oral (n = 18) and parenteral (n = 18) treatment. In both application groups the response rate was 22%, the median survival time 14 and 13 months respectively. Alopecia and leucopenia were the most frequent toxicities. As a result etoposide is efficient in unfavorable ovarian cancer patients with early relapse. Because of better compliance etoposide should be administered parenterally. In respect of response rate and median survival time, etoposide is comparable with paclitaxel.'

Both medications caused a significant reduction in anginal attack frequency and nitroglycerin consumption as compared to placebo; similarly, exercise tolerance was augmented in association with a considerable reduction in ischemia-induced ST-segment depression. The antiischemic effect of gallopamil (SR) was marginally superior to that of nifedipine (SR). Since the incidence of adverse effects was also less with gallopamil (SR) this drug exhibited a more favorable risk-benefit ratio relative to nifedipine (SR).'

A total of 69 children were randomly assigned, with the restriction of groups being approximately equal, to two groups using the two scales, CERT (n = 35) and RPE (n = 34). Both groups performed two trials of identical incremental continuous cycling exercise (Trials 1 and 2) 1 wk, apart for the reliability test. Objective measures of exercise intensity (heart rate, absolute power output, and relative oxygen consumption) and the two subjective measures of effort were obtained during the exercise. For both groups, significant Pearson correlations were found for perceived effort ratings correlated with heart rate (rs > or = .69), power output (rs > or = .75), and oxygen consumption (rs > or = .69). In addition, correlations for CERT were consistently higher than those for RPE. High test-retest intra-class correlations were found for both the effort (R = .96) and perceived exertion (R = .89) groups, indicating that the scales were reliable. In conclusion, the CERT and RPE scales, when translated into Cantonese, are valid and reliable measures of exercise intensity during controlled exercise by children. The Effort rating may be better than the Perceived Exertion scale as a measure of perceived exertion that can be more validly and reliably used with Hong Kong children."

However, when assessed by two different tests, recovery within the first hour was significantly more rapid after diazepam (P less than 0.0001). Prolonged sedation (over 20 hours after injection) was reported occasionally by patients who had received either drug.

S'The influence of perfusion flow rate on whole-body oxygen consumption (VO2), central venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SVO2), and central venous arterial oxygen tension (PVO2) during hypothermic hemodilutional nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass was investigated in 20 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. In 10 patients, the perfusion flow was 2.4 L.min-1 x m-2 (Group I), whereas a flow of 1.2 L.min-1 x m-2 was used in the other 10 patients (Group II). When the body temperature was 29.7 +/- 1.2 degrees C (Group I) and 29.6 +/- 0.8 degrees C (Group II), mixed venous and arterial blood were sampled simultaneously, and whole-body oxygen consumption was calculated. Data collected during hypothermia were compared with the corresponding values achieved after rewarming to 37 degrees C. In both groups, the whole-body oxygen consumption during hypothermia was lower by about 45% than the VO2 after rewarming. However, SVO2 during the low perfusion flow was not significantly different from SVO2 after rewarming, whereas the temperature-corrected PVO2 was significantly lower. In contrast, the high-perfusion flow provided luxury perfusion as evident by the high SVO2, and maintained the temperature-corrected PVO2 within the normothermic range. Thus, maintenance of the normothermic perfusion flow rate during moderate hypothermic hemodilutional cardiopulmonary bypass may provide a safety margin that may compensate for unexpected increase of oxygen consumption or decrease of oxygen delivery.'

Seventy patients received lansoprazole 30 mg once daily and 23 patients received cimetidine 400 mg twice daily. Ulcer healing was assessed by measuring changes in the longitudinal diameter of the ulcer at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the start of treatment. In the lansoprazole group, ulcer diameters became significantly smaller than those in the cimetidine group. In the lansoprazole group, ulcer diameters did not differ significantly between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 or older at the evaluation points. However, in the cimetidine group, ulcer diameters became much smaller in patients younger than 65 years of age than in older patients. These results suggest that the potent acid suppression afforded by lansoprazole led to effective healing of gastric ulcers even in elderly gastric ulcer patients with defective mucosal protection.'

At the conclusion of the study, there were no differences detected in visual acuity, color vision, and contrast sensitivity between the treated and control eyes. There was a trend, however, toward a lesser degree of visual field loss in the brimonidine-treated eyes. There was also a delay in the time required to reach a 25% visual field loss in the treated eyes. These differences were more pronounced in a subgroup of patients diagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa and with visual fields of 5 cm2 or more at baseline. \n                 The findings of this pilot study suggest a trend for slower progression in the eyes of patients with retinal dystrophy when treated with brimonidine, according to one of the parameters that was studied (visual field loss). Further studies that include a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period are needed to clarify and confirm the potential neuroprotective effect of alpha2-agonists in human retinal dystrophies.'

Failure rates and survival times were compared for each variable assessed. Micro-etched molar bands showed a significant reduction in clinical failure rate over untreated molar bands and an increase in mean survival time (P < 0.001).

Health-service resource use, costs and quality of life were calculated for each participant. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was calculated at 6 months. \n                 At 6 months, the total costs were on average higher (\xc2\xa3424, 95% CI -182 to 1045) in the No Peel arm, primarily owing to the higher reoperation rate in the No Peel arm. The mean additional QALYs from ILM peel at 6 months were 0.002 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.013), adjusting for baseline EQ-5D and other minimisation factors. A mean incremental cost per QALY was not computed, as Peeling was on average less costly and slightly more effective. A stochastic analysis suggested that there was more than a 90% probability that Peeling would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \xc2\xa320,000 per QALY. \n                 Although there is no evidence of a statistically significant difference in either costs or QALYs between macular hole surgery with or without ILM peeling, the balance of probabilities is that ILM Peeling is likely to be a cost-effective option for the treatment of macular holes. Further long-term follow-up data are needed to confirm these findings.'

S'Tropisetron and granisetron are selective serotonin (5-HT3) antagonists that have been proven effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting in adults and children receiving cancer chemotherapy. This prospective, randomised study was designed to compare the efficacy of the two agents in the prevention of vomiting and nausea in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy for various malignancies. A total of 51 children (mean age: 7.7 +/- 4.8 year) were studied in 133 chemotherapy cycles. In 66 chemotherapy cycles, the children received tropisetron as an antiemetic agent in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/24 h intravenously and, in 67 cycles, they received granisetron 40 micrograms/kg/24 h intravenously before cytotoxic drug administration during the days they received chemotherapy. The response per 24 h of chemotherapy was defined as complete (no nausea and vomiting), partial (1-4 events of vomiting and/or nausea), and failure (more than 4 events of vomiting and/or nausea). Efficacy of antiemetic therapy was evaluated as acute (Day 1) and overall was based on the worst day during the chemotherapy. Complete control of acute vomiting was achieved in 74% of tropisetron and 88% of granisetron patients (P = 0.04), and complete control of acute nausea in 56% and 82% respectively (p = 0.002). Overall response by means of complete control of both vomiting and nausea during the whole therapy period was 29% of tropisetron group and 55% of granisetron group (p = 0.007). The statistical analysis (depending on the emetogenicity of the chemotherapy cycles) showed increased efficacy of granisetron in highly (grade 3) emetogenic chemotherapy cycles (p = 0.002), whereas there was no difference in the very highly emetogenic cycles (p = 0.7). Also, granisetron was found to be more effective than tropisetron, especially in patients heavier than 25 kg (p = 0.02). The adverse reactions were few and mild. There were no differences in the tolerability of the two antiemetic therapy modalities. In conclusion, granisetron was found to be more effective than tropisetron in controlling nausea and vomiting in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. This increased antiemetic efficacy of ganisetron might have been related to maximal dose differences according to body weight.'

Each group received different volumes and concentrations of contrast material. For each protocol, maximum hepatic enhancement (MHE) was calculated, with an adjustment for iodine dose and patient weight.

CEIs obtained with a contrast material concentration of 240 mg of iodine per milliliter were inferior to those obtained with a concentration of 320 or 350 mg I/mL. At low enhancement thresholds, the volume of contrast material had a more important effect than the concentration on CEI and optimum scanning interval; at high thresholds, concentration had a more important effect. \n                 For a patient of known weight, one can calculate the iodine dose needed to provide a desired level of hepatic enhancement. Use of a contrast material with a concentration of 240 mg L/mL is not recommended for dynamic incremental hepatic CT, except in small patients (eg, those weighing less than 73 kg).'
