among patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, for example, is maximal when the hematocrit is
40 to 45 percent.2
Cardiac disease is the most common cause of death
among patients who are regularly receiving dialysis.3
Among these patients, partial correction of anemia
reduces exercise-induced cardiac ischemia4,5 and ameliorates the left ventricular hypertrophy 4,6-9 that predisposes patients to death and cardiac-related morbidity.10-12 In two pilot studies of patients who were
receiving hemodialysis who maintained a normal hematocrit value13 (and unpublished data), there were no
increases in blood pressure, thrombosis of the vascular access site, seizures, or cardiovascular events, and
normal hematocrit values were associated with an
improved quality of life, shorter hospitalizations, and
increased exercise performance.",1

quality of life and cognitive function,19-21 cardiac function and dimensions,4-9 exercise capacity,22,23 and immune function.24,25 Furthermore, in retrospective
studies, the mortality rate among patients with hematocrits below 30 percent was higher than that
among patients with hematocrits of 30 to 35 percent,
and the risk for the smaller number of patients with
hematocrits above 35 percent was not significantly
different from the risk associated with hematocrits of
30 to 35 percent.26,27 Earlier studies also suggested
that up to 35 percent of patients had increases in
blood pressure after the partial correction of anemia,18 whereas the risk of thrombosis of vascular access sites has remained controversial.18,28-30 In several
small studies, normalization of hematocrit was associated with improvements in cognitive function,31 quality of life,13 exercise capacity,13,32 and sleep.33 Thus,

Modified Constraint-Induced Therapy
in Chronic Stroke: Results of a SingleBlinded Randomized Controlled Trial
Stephen J Page, Peter Levine, Anthony Leonard, Jerzy P Szaflarski, Brett M Kissela

Background and Purpose
This single-blinded randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of a reimbursable, outpatient, modified constraint-induced therapy (mCIT) protocol (half-hour
therapy sessions occurring 3 days per week in which subjects used the more affected
arm combined with less affected arm restriction 5 days per week for 5 hours; both
of these regimens were administered during a 10-week period) with that of a
time-matched exercise program for the more affected arm or a no-treatment control
regimen.",0

Modified Constraint-Induced Therapy in Chronic Stroke

A

mong the myriad of stroke sequelae, hemiparesis is one of
the most pervasive and disabling impairments.1 Yet, evidence
supporting stroke rehabilitation efficacy is limited,2,3 with 30% to 60% of
patients unable to use their more affected arms functionally following
discharge.4 As such, improved rehabilitation strategies are needed, particularly in the subacute (Ͼ3 months
poststroke) and chronic (Ͼ1 year
poststroke) stages, where spontaneous motor recovery often is slowed
or stopped.5,6
Improvements in more affected
arm use and function have been
reported after people with stroke
participated in constraint-induced
therapy (CIT).7–9 Constraint-induced
therapy emphasizes massed practice
with the more affected upper limb
through: (1) restricting patients’ less
affected upper limbs during 90% of
waking hours of a 2-week period and
(2) requiring patients to engage in
6-hour activity sessions using their

Modified Constraint-Induced Therapy
in Chronic Stroke: Results of a SingleBlinded Randomized Controlled Trial
Stephen J Page, Peter Levine, Anthony Leonard, Jerzy P Szaflarski, Brett M Kissela

Background and Purpose
This single-blinded randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of a reimbursable, outpatient, modified constraint-induced therapy (mCIT) protocol (half-hour
therapy sessions occurring 3 days per week in which subjects used the more affected
arm combined with less affected arm restriction 5 days per week for 5 hours; both
of these regimens were administered during a 10-week period) with that of a
time-matched exercise program for the more affected arm or a no-treatment control
regimen.",1
18174447, INTERVENTIONS,"mCIMT versus usual care versus no treatment  mCIMT: functional task by shaping techniques Usual care: PNF, stretching Amount of restraint: 5 waking hours per day Session duration: 30 minutes per day, 3 days per week, 10 weeks for each group Anatomical region restraint: arm and hand","A straightforward, yet efficacious, solution to CIT’s limitations has been
shorter protocols forcing use of the
more affected arm.15,16 The most notable example has been modified
constraint-induced therapy (mCIT),
which combines structured, halfhour, functional practice sessions occurring 3 days per week with restriction of the less affected arm 5 days
per week for 5 hours, both during a
10-week period.",1

the treatment of type 2 diabetes: glucagon-like peptide-1

dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or incretin
enhancers.11,12 Exenatide, the ﬁrst incretin mimetic
approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the
European Medicines Agency for the treatment of type 2
diabetes, has multiple glucoregulatory eﬀects, including
enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion,
reduction of glucagon secretion, reduction of food intake,
and slowing of gastric emptying.13 In placebo-controlled

clinical trials, exenatide administered twice a day
signiﬁcantly improved glycaemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled on one or more
commonly used oral therapies, including metformin,
sulphonylureas, and thiazolidinediones.14–17 Mean haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reductions with exenatide in placebocontrolled trials were roughly 1% from baseline values
of 7·9% to 8·4%, whereas open-label comparator studies
showed HbA1c reductions of 1·1–1·4% from baseline
values of 8·2–9·0%.14–20
Exenatide lowers fasting and postprandial plasma blood
glucose concentrations, and reduces bodyweight in a
substantial proportion of treated patients.14–17 However, its
current delivery method requires twice daily subcutaneous
injection, and does not provide continuous GLP-1R
activation.",0

Background Exenatide is an incretin mimetic that shares glucoregulatory properties with glucagon-like peptide 1
(GLP-1), and improves glycaemic control, with progressive bodyweight reductions, when administered twice a day in
patients with type 2 diabetes.",1

 OTHER TREATMENT:  Not reported","Two new classes of antidiabetic agents based on
potentiation of incretin action have been approved for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes: glucagon-like peptide-1
receptor (GLP-1R) agonists or incretin mimetics, and
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or incretin
enhancers.11,12 Exenatide, the ﬁrst incretin mimetic
approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the
European Medicines Agency for the treatment of type 2
diabetes, has multiple glucoregulatory eﬀects, including
enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion,
reduction of glucagon secretion, reduction of food intake,
and slowing of gastric emptying.13 In placebo-controlled

clinical trials, exenatide administered twice a day
signiﬁcantly improved glycaemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled on one or more
commonly used oral therapies, including metformin,
sulphonylureas, and thiazolidinediones.14–17 Mean haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reductions with exenatide in placebocontrolled trials were roughly 1% from baseline values
of 7·9% to 8·4%, whereas open-label comparator studies
showed HbA1c reductions of 1·1–1·4% from baseline
values of 8·2–9·0%.14–20
Exenatide lowers fasting and postprandial plasma blood
glucose concentrations, and reduces bodyweight in a
substantial proportion of treated patients.14–17 However, its
current delivery method requires twice daily subcutaneous
injection, and does not provide continuous GLP-1R
activation.",1

U

pper limb (UL) hemiparesis is a major factor restricting functional recovery in more than 85% of stroke patients.1,2
Unsuccessful use of the affected UL in stroke patients may cause
“learned nonuse phenomenon,” in which patients habitually rely
on their unaffected UL to accomplish daily activities.3 Constraintinduced therapy (CIT)4,5 has been found to be effective for overcoming learned nonuse.2 CIT involves restraint of the unaffected
UL over an extended period of time (90% of waking hours) in
combination with repetition of task-specific intensive training of
the affected UL (6 hours/session, 5 sessions/week, for 2 weeks).3,5
However, such an intensive training schedule might not be
acceptable for many patients.6 Distributed or modified forms of
CIT were developed.7-9 These forms decreased the training hours
for each session (0.5 to 3 hours/session) and restraint hours per day
(5 to 9 hours/day), and distributed these sessions to a long duration
(3 to 10 weeks).",0

pper limb (UL) hemiparesis is a major factor restricting functional recovery in more than 85% of stroke patients.1,2
Unsuccessful use of the affected UL in stroke patients may cause
“learned nonuse phenomenon,” in which patients habitually rely
on their unaffected UL to accomplish daily activities.3 Constraintinduced therapy (CIT)4,5 has been found to be effective for overcoming learned nonuse.2 CIT involves restraint of the unaffected
UL over an extended period of time (90% of waking hours) in
combination with repetition of task-specific intensive training of
the affected UL (6 hours/session, 5 sessions/week, for 2 weeks).3,5
However, such an intensive training schedule might not be
acceptable for many patients.6 Distributed or modified forms of
CIT were developed.7-9 These forms decreased the training hours
for each session (0.5 to 3 hours/session) and restraint hours per day
(5 to 9 hours/day), and distributed these sessions to a long duration
(3 to 10 weeks).",1

pper limb (UL) hemiparesis is a major factor restricting functional recovery in more than 85% of stroke patients.1,2
Unsuccessful use of the affected UL in stroke patients may cause
“learned nonuse phenomenon,” in which patients habitually rely
on their unaffected UL to accomplish daily activities.3 Constraintinduced therapy (CIT)4,5 has been found to be effective for overcoming learned nonuse.2 CIT involves restraint of the unaffected
UL over an extended period of time (90% of waking hours) in
combination with repetition of task-specific intensive training of
the affected UL (6 hours/session, 5 sessions/week, for 2 weeks).3,5
However, such an intensive training schedule might not be
acceptable for many patients.6 Distributed or modified forms of
CIT were developed.7-9 These forms decreased the training hours
for each session (0.5 to 3 hours/session) and restraint hours per day
(5 to 9 hours/day), and distributed these sessions to a long duration
(3 to 10 weeks).",0

year from the time of diagnosis, and even in the
most favorable situations, most patients die within
two years.1-3 Standard therapy consists of surgical
resection to the extent that is safely feasible, followed by radiotherapy; in the United States, adjuvant carmustine, a nitrosourea drug, is commonly
prescribed.4,5 Cooperative-group trials have investigated the addition of various chemotherapeutic
regimens to radiotherapy,6-9 but no randomized
phase 3 trial of nitrosourea-based adjuvant chemotherapy has demonstrated a significant survival benefit as compared with radiotherapy alone, although
there were more long-term survivors in the chemotherapy groups in some studies.10 A meta-analysis
based on 12 randomized trials suggested a small
survival benefit of chemotherapy, as compared
with radiotherapy alone (a 5 percent increase in
survival at two years, from 15 percent to 20 percent).11 The meta-analysis included 37 percent of
patients with prognostically more favorable, lowergrade gliomas.",0

year from the time of diagnosis, and even in the
most favorable situations, most patients die within
two years.1-3 Standard therapy consists of surgical
resection to the extent that is safely feasible, followed by radiotherapy; in the United States, adjuvant carmustine, a nitrosourea drug, is commonly
prescribed.4,5 Cooperative-group trials have investigated the addition of various chemotherapeutic
regimens to radiotherapy,6-9 but no randomized
phase 3 trial of nitrosourea-based adjuvant chemotherapy has demonstrated a significant survival benefit as compared with radiotherapy alone, although
there were more long-term survivors in the chemotherapy groups in some studies.10 A meta-analysis
based on 12 randomized trials suggested a small
survival benefit of chemotherapy, as compared
with radiotherapy alone (a 5 percent increase in
survival at two years, from 15 percent to 20 percent).11 The meta-analysis included 37 percent of

of 75 mg per square meter for up to seven weeks is
safe; this level of exposure to temozolomide15 depletes the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT).16 This effect may
be important because low levels of MGMT in tumor
tissue are associated with longer survival among patients with glioblastoma who are receiving nitrosourea-based adjuvant chemotherapy.17,18
A pilot phase 2 trial demonstrated the feasibility
of the concomitant administration of temozolomide with fractionated radiotherapy, followed by up
to six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, and suggested that this treatment had promising clinical activity (two-year survival rate, 31 percent).19 The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of

VITAMINS, HRT, AND CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS

ported to date, the Women’s Health Initiative, was stopped prematurely because overall risk exceeded benefit,
including an increased risk of nonfatal
myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary death, which was the study’s primary outcome.10 As a result of this discrepancy between clinical trial results and
other evidence, guidelines do not offer
consistent, explicit recommendations for
the use of this therapy in postmenopausal women.11
Like HRT, antioxidant consumption, either dietary or in the form of vitamin supplements, has been associated with a reduced risk of coronary
disease in epidemiological studies.12-16 In
a coronary angiographic trial, participants who took supplemental vitamin E
(not as part of the trial) demonstrated less
lesion progression.17 Theoretically, antioxidants inhibit a key component of
atherogenesis (oxidation of LDL cholesterol within the vessel wall), and other
mechanisms have been demonstrated in
animal experiments, including preservation of nitric oxide activity, inhibition of leukocyte adhesion, reduction of
cellular oxidative injury, and inhibition
of platelet adhesion.18
Five randomized, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin E in patients
with or at risk for coronary disease have
been completed,19-23 and all but the
smallest and shortest20 reported no benefit.",0

myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary death, which was the study’s primary outcome.10 As a result of this discrepancy between clinical trial results and
other evidence, guidelines do not offer
consistent, explicit recommendations for

disease in epidemiological studies.12-16 In
a coronary angiographic trial, participants who took supplemental vitamin E
(not as part of the trial) demonstrated less
lesion progression.17 Theoretically, antioxidants inhibit a key component of
atherogenesis (oxidation of LDL cholesterol within the vessel wall), and other
mechanisms have been demonstrated in
animal experiments, including preservation of nitric oxide activity, inhibition of leukocyte adhesion, reduction of
cellular oxidative injury, and inhibition
of platelet adhesion.18

Women’s Health Initiative, an increased risk of cardiovascular events
was recently reported after 5.2 years of
combined HRT, with a relative risk of
1.29 (95% CI, 1.02-1.63).10
In the only previous coronary angiographic trial of HRT, the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis Trial, 309
women with coronary disease were randomized to estrogen alone, to estrogen
plus continuous medroxyprogesterone, or to placebo.9 Among the 248
women who underwent follow-up angiography, MLD over the 3.2 years of follow-up worsened by 0.09 (0.02) mm in

exhibits other anti-atherosclerotic effects in animal models.24
To study possible benefits left

INTRODUCTION

Bone metastases are common in advanced cancer,
occurring in up to 75% of patients with advanced
prostate cancer and breast cancer, and more than
95% of patients with multiple myeloma.1,2 Complications of bone metastases include bone pain, hypercalcemia, and skeletal-related events (SREs),
such as fracture, need for radiation or surgery to
bone, or spinal cord compression.1,2
The current standard of care for treatment of
bonemetastasisincludessystemictherapy(eg,chemotherapy, bisphosphonates) and local treatments
(eg, surgery or radiation) to bone.",0

Denosumab in Patients With Bone Metastases

type-1 procollagen (P1NP), osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline
phosphatase (BSAP), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b
(TRAP-5b), have been observed in all types of bone metastases
regardless of tumor origin or radiographic appearance (osteolytic
or osteoblastic).7-9,11
Bone destruction is mediated by osteoclasts, whose formation,
function, and survival requires the receptor activator of NF-␬B ligand
(RANKL).12,13 Preclinical models of bone metastases demonstrated
that cancer cells induced increased RANKL expression and decreased osteoprotegerin expression (endogenous RANKL inhibitor) by osteoblasts, regardless of the radiographic appearance of the
bone lesions (osteolytic or osteoblastic).14,15 It is hypothesized that
through RANKL, tumor cells induce osteoclast activation, which then
mediates bone resorption and release of growth factors, resulting in a
cycle of bone destruction and tumor proliferation.16
Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically
inhibits RANKL, inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone destruction.17-19
Phase I and II clinical trials have shown that denosumab suppressed
bone resorption in patients with malignant bone disease from multiple myeloma or breast cancer.18,20 Results from a phase II study demonstrated that denosumab substantially suppressed uNTx and other
bone turnover markers in women with bone metastases from breast
cancer who were naïve to IV BPs.20 Herein, we assessed the effect of
denosumab in patients with bone metastases who had elevated uNTx
levels despite ongoing IV BP therapy.",0

Catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CA-BSIs) are a signiﬁcant
cause of morbidity, mortality, and
added medical costs to hospitalized
adult and pediatric patients.1–11 According to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System established by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), the
pooled mean in 2004 among 54 PICUs
was 6.6 CA-BSIs per 1000 catheterdays, higher than in many adult ICUs.12
More recent estimates that included
36 PICUs have shown a pooled mean
rate of 5.3 CA-BSIs per 1000 catheterdays.13 Despite these data, strategies
to reduce health care complications
such as pediatric CA-BSIs have received relatively little attention.",1

sites is not deﬁnitive for pediatric patients.12,23–25 The maintenance bundle

physicians and nurses from approximately 20 children’s institutions

 Wash hands before the procedure 
 For all children aged 2 months, Chlorhexidine gluconate should be used to scrub the insertion site for 30 seconds for all areas except the groin, which should be scrubbed for 2 minutes. Scrubbing should be followed by 30 to 60 seconds of air drying 
 No iodine skin prep or ointment should be used at the insertion site 
 Prepackage or fill the insertion cart, tray, or box including full sterile barriers 
 Create an insertion checklist, which empowers staff to stop a non-emergent procedure if it does not follow sterile insertion practices

Catheter-associated bloodstream infections (CA-BSIs) are a signiﬁcant
cause of morbidity, mortality, and
added medical costs to hospitalized
adult and pediatric patients.1–11 According to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System established by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), the
pooled mean in 2004 among 54 PICUs
was 6.6 CA-BSIs per 1000 catheterdays, higher than in many adult ICUs.12
More recent estimates that included
36 PICUs have shown a pooled mean
rate of 5.3 CA-BSIs per 1000 catheterdays.13 Despite these data, strategies
to reduce health care complications
such as pediatric CA-BSIs have received relatively little attention.",0

(1) people with different chronic diseases have similar
problems and concerns; (2) people with chronic diseases can
learn to take responsibility for the day-to-day management
of their disease(s); (3) confident, knowledgeable patients
practicing self-management will experience improved

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is one of the
most common sexually transmitted diseases in the
United States and is characterized by latent infection
and mucocutaneous recurrences.1,2 Up to 25% of pregnant women have been reported to have serologic evidence of previous HSV exposure.2 Twenty percent of
these women will have a symptomatic recurrence of

Andrews et al
HSV infection during pregnancy and approximately one
quarter of such cases occur in late gestation.1-3 A paramount concern regarding maternal HSV infection during pregnancy is the potential for vertical transmission
to the fetus and/or newborn.1,4,5 To reduce vertical
transmission, current management guidelines recommend cesarean delivery for women with active perineal
HSV lesions or prodromal symptoms at the time of
delivery.1,6
Several investigations have explored the potential use
of antiviral therapy with acyclovir during the late third
trimester of pregnancy to prevent HSV recurrences at
the time of delivery.7-14 Results of these investigations
have suggested that acyclovir, initiated at 36 weeks’ gestation, can reduce clinical recurrences and may reduce
the need for cesarean delivery resulting from active
HSV lesions.7-14 With 1 exception,14 detection of HSV
viral shedding in these studies was limited to culture
alone and did not include the more sensitive polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) assay.",t0
