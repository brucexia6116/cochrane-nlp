cases, the choice of potential therapies

the duration and decreasing the number of antibiotics given to ICU patients

of prevention and better utilization of antimicrobial therapy, notably shortening
the duration and decreasing the number of antibiotics given to ICU patients
to contain the emergence and dissemination of such pathogens.3,9-12 Because of
its frequency and severity,13,14 nosocomial pneumonia in patients requiring

Practice implications
* Regular assessment of the functional abilities
of elderly people living at home has been claimed
to improve health and reduce the use of
institutional care
* This study shows no convincing evidence for
this assumption for the general population of

elderly people
* Regular assessment seems to be effective,
however, when restricted to those elderly people
with poor health

experiments in which the general population was
screened by a public health nurse or general practitioner and followed up by a primary care team also
reported hardly any positive effects.",0

their patients if they were to provide all the preventive services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task
Force.16 Using other allied health members of the practice team has been recommended to overcome this barrier and help the primary care physician enhance delivery of evidence-based preventive services.17,18

among patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, for example, is maximal when the hematocrit is
40 to 45 percent.2
Cardiac disease is the most common cause of death
among patients who are regularly receiving dialysis.3
Among these patients, partial correction of anemia
reduces exercise-induced cardiac ischemia4,5 and ameliorates the left ventricular hypertrophy 4,6-9 that predisposes patients to death and cardiac-related morbidity.10-12 In two pilot studies of patients who were
receiving hemodialysis who maintained a normal hematocrit value13 (and unpublished data), there were no
increases in blood pressure, thrombosis of the vascular access site, seizures, or cardiovascular events, and
normal hematocrit values were associated with an
improved quality of life, shorter hospitalizations, and
increased exercise performance.",1

quality of life and cognitive function,19-21 cardiac function and dimensions,4-9 exercise capacity,22,23 and immune function.24,25 Furthermore, in retrospective
studies, the mortality rate among patients with hematocrits below 30 percent was higher than that
among patients with hematocrits of 30 to 35 percent,
and the risk for the smaller number of patients with
hematocrits above 35 percent was not significantly
different from the risk associated with hematocrits of
30 to 35 percent.26,27 Earlier studies also suggested
that up to 35 percent of patients had increases in
blood pressure after the partial correction of anemia,18 whereas the risk of thrombosis of vascular access sites has remained controversial.18,28-30 In several
small studies, normalization of hematocrit was associated with improvements in cognitive function,31 quality of life,13 exercise capacity,13,32 and sleep.33 Thus,

Modified Constraint-Induced Therapy
in Chronic Stroke: Results of a SingleBlinded Randomized Controlled Trial
Stephen J Page, Peter Levine, Anthony Leonard, Jerzy P Szaflarski, Brett M Kissela

Background and Purpose
This single-blinded randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of a reimbursable, outpatient, modified constraint-induced therapy (mCIT) protocol (half-hour
therapy sessions occurring 3 days per week in which subjects used the more affected
arm combined with less affected arm restriction 5 days per week for 5 hours; both
of these regimens were administered during a 10-week period) with that of a
time-matched exercise program for the more affected arm or a no-treatment control
regimen.",0

enhancers.11,12 Exenatide, the ﬁrst incretin mimetic
approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the
European Medicines Agency for the treatment of type 2
diabetes, has multiple glucoregulatory eﬀects, including
enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion,
reduction of glucagon secretion, reduction of food intake,
and slowing of gastric emptying.13 In placebo-controlled

clinical trials, exenatide administered twice a day
signiﬁcantly improved glycaemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled on one or more
commonly used oral therapies, including metformin,
sulphonylureas, and thiazolidinediones.14–17 Mean haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reductions with exenatide in placebocontrolled trials were roughly 1% from baseline values
of 7·9% to 8·4%, whereas open-label comparator studies
showed HbA1c reductions of 1·1–1·4% from baseline
values of 8·2–9·0%.14–20
Exenatide lowers fasting and postprandial plasma blood
glucose concentrations, and reduces bodyweight in a
substantial proportion of treated patients.14–17 However, its
current delivery method requires twice daily subcutaneous
injection, and does not provide continuous GLP-1R
activation.",0

Background Exenatide is an incretin mimetic that shares glucoregulatory properties with glucagon-like peptide 1
(GLP-1), and improves glycaemic control, with progressive bodyweight reductions, when administered twice a day in
patients with type 2 diabetes.",1

 OTHER TREATMENT:  Not reported","Two new classes of antidiabetic agents based on
potentiation of incretin action have been approved for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes: glucagon-like peptide-1
receptor (GLP-1R) agonists or incretin mimetics, and
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or incretin
enhancers.11,12 Exenatide, the ﬁrst incretin mimetic
approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the
European Medicines Agency for the treatment of type 2
diabetes, has multiple glucoregulatory eﬀects, including
enhancement of glucose-dependent insulin secretion,
reduction of glucagon secretion, reduction of food intake,
and slowing of gastric emptying.13 In placebo-controlled

clinical trials, exenatide administered twice a day
signiﬁcantly improved glycaemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled on one or more
commonly used oral therapies, including metformin,
sulphonylureas, and thiazolidinediones.14–17 Mean haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reductions with exenatide in placebocontrolled trials were roughly 1% from baseline values
of 7·9% to 8·4%, whereas open-label comparator studies
showed HbA1c reductions of 1·1–1·4% from baseline
values of 8·2–9·0%.14–20
Exenatide lowers fasting and postprandial plasma blood
glucose concentrations, and reduces bodyweight in a
substantial proportion of treated patients.14–17 However, its
current delivery method requires twice daily subcutaneous
injection, and does not provide continuous GLP-1R
activation.",1

microspheres of exenatide and poly (D,L lactic-co-glycolic
acid), a common biodegradable medical polymer with
established use in absorbable sutures and extendedrelease pharmaceuticals, that allows gradual drug delivery
at a controlled rate.22 A small pilot study of exenatide once
a week over 15 weeks resulted in signiﬁcant reductions in
HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, postprandial plasma
glucose, and bodyweight.21 In the current study, we
compared the safety and eﬃcacy of exenatide once a week
to that of exenatide given twice daily, over 30 weeks, in
patients with type 2 diabetes.",0

U

pper limb (UL) hemiparesis is a major factor restricting functional recovery in more than 85% of stroke patients.1,2
Unsuccessful use of the affected UL in stroke patients may cause
“learned nonuse phenomenon,” in which patients habitually rely
on their unaffected UL to accomplish daily activities.3 Constraintinduced therapy (CIT)4,5 has been found to be effective for overcoming learned nonuse.2 CIT involves restraint of the unaffected
UL over an extended period of time (90% of waking hours) in
combination with repetition of task-specific intensive training of
the affected UL (6 hours/session, 5 sessions/week, for 2 weeks).3,5
However, such an intensive training schedule might not be
acceptable for many patients.6 Distributed or modified forms of
CIT were developed.7-9 These forms decreased the training hours
for each session (0.5 to 3 hours/session) and restraint hours per day
(5 to 9 hours/day), and distributed these sessions to a long duration
(3 to 10 weeks).",0

pper limb (UL) hemiparesis is a major factor restricting functional recovery in more than 85% of stroke patients.1,2
Unsuccessful use of the affected UL in stroke patients may cause
“learned nonuse phenomenon,” in which patients habitually rely
on their unaffected UL to accomplish daily activities.3 Constraintinduced therapy (CIT)4,5 has been found to be effective for overcoming learned nonuse.2 CIT involves restraint of the unaffected
UL over an extended period of time (90% of waking hours) in
combination with repetition of task-specific intensive training of
the affected UL (6 hours/session, 5 sessions/week, for 2 weeks).3,5
However, such an intensive training schedule might not be
acceptable for many patients.6 Distributed or modified forms of
CIT were developed.7-9 These forms decreased the training hours
for each session (0.5 to 3 hours/session) and restraint hours per day
(5 to 9 hours/day), and distributed these sessions to a long duration
(3 to 10 weeks).",1

CIT or its derivatives (distributed or modified CIT), relative to

An alternative treatment program that is gaining increasing attention is bilateral arm training (BAT), which employs the repetitive
practice of symmetrical bilateral movement (0.3 to 2.25 hours/day,
3 to 5 days/week, for 2 to 8 weeks) to improve motor performance
of the affected UL.13,14 There are a variety of forms of BAT.15 Some
involve robot-assisted and repetitive movement training,13,16-18
whereas others employ repetitive practice of functional tasks.19-22
Some studies have revealed that BAT reduces UL impairment
(evaluated by Fugl–Meyer Assessment [FMA]) when compared
with traditional rehabilitation,13,17,21-23 whereas others claim that BAT
did not confer benefits on performance of impaired UL18,21,22 and
had limited effects on functional independence19,23 and spontaneous
use of the affected hand.18 Small sample sizes, differential degrees of
initial impairment, and insufficient intensity of treatment may each
have contributed to the lack of significant effects.",1

pper limb (UL) hemiparesis is a major factor restricting functional recovery in more than 85% of stroke patients.1,2
Unsuccessful use of the affected UL in stroke patients may cause
“learned nonuse phenomenon,” in which patients habitually rely
on their unaffected UL to accomplish daily activities.3 Constraintinduced therapy (CIT)4,5 has been found to be effective for overcoming learned nonuse.2 CIT involves restraint of the unaffected
UL over an extended period of time (90% of waking hours) in
combination with repetition of task-specific intensive training of
the affected UL (6 hours/session, 5 sessions/week, for 2 weeks).3,5
However, such an intensive training schedule might not be
acceptable for many patients.6 Distributed or modified forms of
CIT were developed.7-9 These forms decreased the training hours
for each session (0.5 to 3 hours/session) and restraint hours per day
(5 to 9 hours/day), and distributed these sessions to a long duration
(3 to 10 weeks).",0

year from the time of diagnosis, and even in the
most favorable situations, most patients die within
two years.1-3 Standard therapy consists of surgical
resection to the extent that is safely feasible, followed by radiotherapy; in the United States, adjuvant carmustine, a nitrosourea drug, is commonly
prescribed.4,5 Cooperative-group trials have investigated the addition of various chemotherapeutic
regimens to radiotherapy,6-9 but no randomized

of 75 mg per square meter for up to seven weeks is
safe; this level of exposure to temozolomide15 depletes the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT).16 This effect may
be important because low levels of MGMT in tumor
tissue are associated with longer survival among patients with glioblastoma who are receiving nitrosourea-based adjuvant chemotherapy.17,18

of the concomitant administration of temozolomide with fractionated radiotherapy, followed by up

VITAMINS, HRT, AND CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS

ported to date, the Women’s Health Initiative, was stopped prematurely because overall risk exceeded benefit,
including an increased risk of nonfatal
myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary death, which was the study’s primary outcome.10 As a result of this discrepancy between clinical trial results and
other evidence, guidelines do not offer
consistent, explicit recommendations for
the use of this therapy in postmenopausal women.11
Like HRT, antioxidant consumption, either dietary or in the form of vitamin supplements, has been associated with a reduced risk of coronary
disease in epidemiological studies.12-16 In
a coronary angiographic trial, participants who took supplemental vitamin E
(not as part of the trial) demonstrated less
lesion progression.17 Theoretically, antioxidants inhibit a key component of
atherogenesis (oxidation of LDL cholesterol within the vessel wall), and other
mechanisms have been demonstrated in
animal experiments, including preservation of nitric oxide activity, inhibition of leukocyte adhesion, reduction of
cellular oxidative injury, and inhibition
of platelet adhesion.18
Five randomized, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin E in patients
with or at risk for coronary disease have
been completed,19-23 and all but the
smallest and shortest20 reported no benefit.",0

was recently reported after 5.2 years of
combined HRT, with a relative risk of
1.29 (95% CI, 1.02-1.63).10
In the only previous coronary angiographic trial of HRT, the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis Trial, 309
women with coronary disease were randomized to estrogen alone, to estrogen
plus continuous medroxyprogesterone, or to placebo.9 Among the 248
women who underwent follow-up angiography, MLD over the 3.2 years of follow-up worsened by 0.09 (0.02) mm in
