'''
Supervised distant supervision for PICO extraction.

Here we aim to go from the information (direct 
distant supervision for PICO task) contained in 
the annotations file to feature vectors and labels for the 
candidate filtering task. In the writeup nomenclature,
this is to generate \tilde{x} and \tilde{y}.

    We are making the assumption that files containing *labels* are (at least 
    optionally) distinct from the file containing the corresponding labels. 
    The former path is specified by the "candidates_path" argument; the latter 
    by the "labels path". This was an easy way to get out of unicode hell. 
    This way, you can use the candidates file you originally generate directly 
    and combine this with the labels returned (in whatever format they may be). 

    We make the assumption that the 'original' file comprises
    the following fields (in this order!)

        study id,PICO field,CDSR sentence,candidate sentence

    And the labels file should have the labels in the label_index (by default,
    the last column in the sheet).

    This function returns a dictionary, where the keys are the domains of interest,
    specifically "CHAR_PARTICIPANTS", "CHAR_INTERVENTIONS" and "CHAR_OUTCOMES".
    Each of these, in turn, contains X and y vectors (of equal cardinality).
    The X instances are tuples, where the first entry is a vector of numerical 
    features, while the second is the string containing (whitespace-delimited) 
    textual features. The y vectors are singletons for each instance and are 
    currently strings \in {"0", "1", "2"}.
