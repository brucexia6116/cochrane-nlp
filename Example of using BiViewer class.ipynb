Children were further randomised to receive either 0.15 mg/kg salbutamol every 30 minutes for the first three hours of admission, or 5 mg salbutamol every one to four hours as needed. Treatment was double blind and the assessor was unaware of the nebuliser regimen given. Children were examined before and after treatment with salbutamol on arrival and reassessed four hours after admission. Seventy children completed the study. Seventeen (46%) of 37 children receiving prednisolone and six (9%) of 33 receiving placebo were fit for discharge after four hours of treatment. There was no significant difference between the two nebuliser regimens. Clinical parameters indicative of asthma severity were improved in all groups. Between group comparisons at reassessment showed higher peak flows in those receiving prednisolone and nebulisers every 30 minutes but differences were not significant for other parameters. Objective parameters indicating steroid efficacy over placebo were minimal. Despite this, those receiving prednisolone were more readily identifiable as being fit for discharge within four hours of treatment.',\n",

The use of monetary incentives is one of the most effective strategies for increasing response rates. However, the effect and cost of such an incentive on retail pharmacists' response rates has not been well studied. \\n                 A sample of 700 pharmacies was selected at random from the electronic Yellow Pages in NSW Australia and mailed a brief survey regarding pharmacotherapies and advice for smoking cessation. Half of the sample was randomly allocated to receive an offer of an 14 US dollars gift voucher. \\n                 The response rates were 65.9% for the voucher group and 53.5% for the no-voucher group. The odds of response from the voucher group was 1.68 (95%CI = 1.23, 2.30) times greater than for the no-voucher group. The cost per additional respondent was 67.95 US dollars. The incentive also reduced follow up costs by 10%. \\n                 A moderately sized monetary incentive is able to achieve a significant increase in response rates for retail pharmacists, thereby reducing potential bias in the sample.\",\n",
