A randomized trial , Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 9902 , was undertaken to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel , estramustine , and etoposide ( TEE ) plus AS+RT would improve disease outcomes with acceptable toxicity . High-risk ( prostate-specific antigen 20-100 ng/mL and Gleason score > or=7 ; or Stage T2 or greater , Gleason score 8 , prostate-specific antigen level < 100 ng/mL ) nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients were randomized to AS+RT ( Arm 1 ) vs. AS+RT plus four cycles of TEE ( Arm 2 ) . TEE was delivered 4 weeks after RT . AS continued for 2 years for both treatment arms . RT began after 8 weeks of AS began . The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9902 trial opened January 11 , 2000 . Excess thromboembolic toxicity was noted , leading to study closure October 4 , 2004 . A total of 397 patients were accrued , and the data for 381 were analyzable . An acute and long-term toxicity analysis was performed . The worst overall toxicities during treatment were increased for Arm 2 . Of the 192 patients , 136 ( 71 % ) on Arm 2 had RTOG Grade 3 or greater toxicity compared with 70 ( 37 % ) of 189 patients on Arm 1 . Statistically significant increases in hematologic toxicity ( p < 0.0001 ) and gastrointestinal toxicity ( p = 0.017 ) but not genitourinary toxicity ( p = 0.07 ) were noted during treatment . Two Grade 5 complications related to neutropenic infection occurred in Arm 2 . Three cases of myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia were noted in Arm 2 . At 2 and 3 years after therapy completion , excess long-term toxicity was not observed in Arm 2 . TEE was associated with significantly increased toxicity during treatment . The toxicity profiles did not differ at 2 and 3 years after therapy . Toxicity is an important consideration in the design of trials using adjuvant chemotherapy for prostate cancer .\n",

A total of 159 patients were enrolled in a double-blind randomized trial to determine if thalidomide can improve the efficacy of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in hormone responsive patients with an increasing prostate specific antigen after primary definitive therapy for prostate cancer . Patients were randomized to 6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist followed by 200 mg per day oral thalidomide or placebo ( oral phase A ) . At the time of prostate specific antigen progression gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist was restarted for 6 additional months . Patients were then crossed over to the opposite drug and were treated until prostate specific antigen progression ( oral phase B ) . Testosterone and dihydroxytestosterone were likewise monitored throughout the study . During oral phase A the median time to prostate specific antigen progression was 15 months for the thalidomide group compared to 9.6 months on placebo ( p = 0.21 ) . The median time to prostate specific antigen progression during oral phase B for the thalidomide group was 17.1 vs 6.6 months on placebo ( p = 0.0002 ) . No differences in time to serum testosterone normalization between the thalidomide and placebo arms were documented during oral phase A and oral phase B. Thalidomide was tolerable although dose reductions occurred in 47 % ( 58 of 124 ) of patients . Despite thalidomide having no effect on testosterone normalization , there was a clear effect on prostate specific antigen progression during oral phase B . This is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate the effects of thalidomide using intermittent hormonal therapy .\n",

A phase III study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sipuleucel-T in a placebo-controlled study . A total of 127 patients with asymptomatic metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive three infusions of sipuleucel-T ( n = 82 ) or placebo ( n = 45 ) every 2 weeks . On disease progression , placebo patients could receive APC8015F , a product made with frozen leukapheresis cells . Of the 127 patients , 115 patients had progressive disease at the time of data analysis , and all patients were followed for survival for 36 months . The median for time to disease progression ( TTP ) for sipuleucel-T was 11.7 weeks compared with 10.0 weeks for placebo ( P = .052 , log-rank ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.45 ; 95 % CI , 0.99 to 2.11 ) . Median survival was 25.9 months for sipuleucel-T and 21.4 months for placebo ( P = .01 , log-rank ; HR , 1.70 ; 95 % CI , 1.13 to 2.56 ) . Treatment remained a strong independent predictor of overall survival after adjusting for prognostic factors using a Cox multivariable regression model ( P = .002 , Wald test ; HR , 2.12 ; 95 % CI , 1.31 to 3.44 ) . The median ratio of T-cell stimulation at 8 weeks to pretreatment was eight-fold higher in sipuleucel-T-treated patients ( 16.9 v 1.99 ; P < .001 ) . Sipuleucel-T therapy was well tolerated . While the improvement in the primary end point TTP did not achieve statistical significance , this study suggests that sipuleucel-T may provide a survival advantage to asymptomatic HRPC patients . Supportive studies are underway .\n",

In light of the significant sequelae of prostate cancer treatment , prevention is desirable , and men with HGPIN would be suitable , high-risk subjects . There is in vitro , in vivo , epidemiologic , and human experimental evidence that selenium supplementation may protect against prostate cancer . This article introduces the rationale for , and progress to date , of a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial of selenium supplementation ( 200 mug/d in the form of selenomethionine ) , to prevent the development of prostate cancer among men with HGPIN . The trial , Southwest Oncology Group Protocol 9917 , funded by a National Cancer Institute program supporting pivotal prevention trials has registered 537 patients and has randomized > 380 to date .

Patients with localized prostate cancer received amifostine as a rectal suspension 30-45 minutes before daily three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy . The first 18 patients received 1 g of amifostine , and the next 12 patients received 2 g. Toxicity was assessed at baseline , during treatment , and at follow-up visits by using RTOG grading and the EPIC Quality of Life ( QoL ) 50-item questionnaire . The Bowel Function subset of the bowel domain ( EPIC-BF ) , which targets symptom severity , and the Bowel Bother subset of the bowel domain ( EPIC-BB ) , which assesses QoL , were evaluated and compared with the RTOG GI toxicity score . Median follow-up was 30 months ( range , 18-36 months ) . Overall , EPIC-BF and EPIC-BB scores both tracked closely with the RTOG GI toxicity score . Seven weeks after the start of radiation therapy , the incidence of RTOG Grade 2 toxicity was 33 % in the 1-g group ( 6/18 patients ) compared with 0 % ( 0/12 patients ) in the 2-g group and tended toward statistical significance ( p = 0.06 ) . A significant difference between amifostine groups was observed using the EPIC-BF score at 7 weeks ( p = 0.04 ) . A difference in EPIC-BB scores between dose groups was evident at 7 weeks ( p = 0.07 ) and was significant at 12 months ( p = 0.04 ) . Higher doses of amifostine produced significant improvements in acute and late bowel QoL ( up to 1 year after therapy ) , measured using the EPIC score .\n",

This phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of earlier treatment with zoledronic acid in men with castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer . Men with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastases whose androgen-deprivation therapy was initiated within 6 months of study entry were randomly assigned in a blinded 1:1 ratio to receive zoledronic acid ( 4 mg intravenously every 4 weeks ) or a placebo . After their disease progressed to castration-resistant status , all patients received open-label treatment with zoledronic acid . The primary end point was time to first SRE , defined as radiation to bone , clinical fracture , spinal cord compression , surgery to bone , or death as a result of prostate cancer . Target accrual was 680 patients . Primary analysis was planned after 470 SREs . The study was discontinued prematurely ( 645 patients ; 299 SREs ) after the corporate supporter withdrew study drug supply . Early zoledronic acid was not associated with increased time to first SRE . The median time to first SRE was 31.9 months in the zoledronic acid group ( 95 % CI , 24.2 to 40.3 ) and 29.8 months in the placebo group ( 95 % CI , 25.3 to 37.2 ; hazard ratio , 0.97 ; 95 % CI , 0 to 1.17 ; one-sided stratified log-rank P = .39 ) . Overall survival was similar between the groups ( hazard ratio , 0.88 ; 95 % CI , 0.70 to 1.12 ; P = .29 ) . Rates of adverse events were similar between the groups . In men with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastases , early treatment with zoledronic acid was not associated with lower risk for SREs .\n",

Replacement of T in hypogonadal men improves several bone parameters . Replacement of GH in GH-deficient men improves BMD . Our objective was to determine whether T and GH treatment together improves the structural and mechanical parameters of bone more than T alone in men with hypopituitarism . This randomized , prospective , 2-year study included 32 men with severe deficiencies of T and GH due to panhypopituitarism . Subjects were randomized to receive T alone ( n = 15 ) or T and GH ( n = 17 ) for 2 years . We evaluated magnetic resonance microimaging-derived structural ( bone volume fraction [ BVF ] and trabecular thickness ) and mechanical ( axial stiffness [ AS ] , a measure of bone strength ) properties of the distal tibia at baseline and after 1 and 2 years of treatment . Treatment with T and GH did not affect BVF , thickness , or AS differently from T alone . T treatment in all subjects for 2 years increased trabecular BVF by 9.6 % ( P < .0001 ) , trabecular thickness by 2.6 % ( P < .001 ) , and trabecular AS by 9.8 % ( P < .001 ) . In contrast , testosterone treatment in all subjects significantly increased cortical thickness by 2.4 % ( P < .01 ) but decreased cortical BVF by -4.7 % ( P < .01 ) and cortical AS by -6.9 % ( P < .01 ) . Combined T and GH treatment of men with hypopituitarism for 2 years did not improve the measured structural or mechanical parameters of the distal tibia more than T alone . However , testosterone significantly increased the structural and mechanical properties of trabecular bone but decreased most of these properties of cortical bone , illustrating the potential importance of assessing trabecular and cortical bone separately in future studies of the effect of testosterone on bone .\n",

Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics , toxicity analysis and overall survival . The study was an open-label , phase II , two-stage design , focusing on the results from the second stage , as criteria for progression were modified after completing the first stage . Sorafenib was given at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles . Clinical and laboratory assessments were done every 4 weeks , and radiographic scans were obtained every 8 weeks . Twenty-four patients were accrued in the second stage ; the median ( range ) age was 66 ( 49-85 ) years , the on-study prostate-specific antigen level was 68.45 ( 5.8-995 ) ng/mL , the Gleason score 8 ( 6-9 ) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 1 ( in 17 patients ) . Of the 24 patients , 21 had previous chemotherapy with docetaxel . All patients had bony metastases , either alone ( in 11 ) or with soft-tissue disease ( in 13 ) . One patient had a partial response ; 10 patients had stable disease ( median duration 18 weeks , range 15-48 ) . At a median potential follow-up of 27.2 months , the median progression-free survival was 3.7 months and the median overall survival was 18.0 months . For the whole trial of 46 patients the median survival was 18.3 months . Most frequent toxicities included hand-foot skin reaction ( grade 2 in nine patients , grade 3 in three ) , rash , abnormalities in liver function tests , and fatigue . Sorafenib has moderate activity as a second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer .\n",

Because no cure is available for this orphan disease and treatment options are limited , slowing of disease progression would be a meaningful outcome . To determine whether high-dose docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , an ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , slows progression of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa measured by cone electroretinography ( ERG ) . A 4-year , single-site , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-masked phase 2 clinical trial at a research center specializing in medical retina . Seventy-eight male patients diagnosed as having X-linked retinitis pigmentosa were randomized to DHA or placebo . Data were omitted for 2 patients with non-X-linked retinitis pigmentosa and 16 patients who were unable to follow protocol during the first year . The remaining participants were tested annually and composed a modified intent-to-treat cohort ( DHA group , n = 33 ; placebo group , n = 27 ) . All participants received a multivitamin and were randomly assigned to oral DHA ( 30 mg/kg/d ) or placebo . The primary outcome was the rate of loss of cone ERG function . Secondary outcomes were rod and maximal ERG amplitudes and cone ERG implicit times . Capsule counts and red blood cell DHA levels were assessed to monitor adherence . Average ( 6-month to 4-year ) red blood cell DHA levels were 4-fold higher in the DHA group than in the placebo group ( P < .001 ) . There was no difference between the DHA and placebo groups in the rate of cone ERG functional loss ( 0.028 vs 0.022 log µV/y , respectively ; P = .30 ) . No group differences were evident for change in rod ERG ( P = .27 ) , maximal ERG ( P = .65 ) , or cone implicit time ( no change over 4 years ) . The rate of cone loss ( ie , event rate ) was markedly reduced compared with rates in previous studies . No severe treatment-emergent adverse events were found . Long-term DHA supplementation was not effective in slowing the loss of cone or rod ERG function associated with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa . Participant dropout and lower-than-expected disease event rate limited power to detect statistical significance . A larger sample size , longer trial , and attainment of a target blood DHA level ( 13 % ) would be desirable . While DHA supplementation at 30 mg/kg/d does not present serious adverse effects , routine monitoring of gastrointestinal tolerance is prudent . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00100230 .\n",

This study evaluated the potential activity of lapatinib in men with biochemically-relapsed androgen-dependent ( stage D0 ) prostate cancer . Patients with a rising PSA after primary therapy for prostate cancer were enrolled . A PSA doubling time ( PSADT ) < 12 months was required . Lapatinib was administered at 1,500 mg orally daily . Outcome measures were changes in PSA kinetics . Primary tumor blocks were obtained and assessed for EGFR expression , EGFR Q787Q polymorphism , and Kras 38 mutational status . Forty-nine patients were enrolled ( 14 ineligible ) , resulting in 35 patients for analysis . No PSA response was observed ; best response was stable disease ( n = 28 , 80.0 % ) . Pretreatment average slope was 0.19 log ( PSA ) /month ( PSADT = 3.70 months ) , in contrast to on-treatment average slope of 0.13 log ( PSA ) /month ( PSADT = 5.44 months ) using linear mixed effects models ( P = 0.006 ) . Median progression-free survival ( PFS ) was 17.4 months for the high EGFR group and 6.0 months for the low EGFR group ( P = 0.50 ) . Patients with Kras 38 mutation had shorter PFS than those without Kras 38 mutation ( P = 0.09 ) . Although no PSA responses ( primary endpoint ) was observed , lapatinib may have biologic activity in men with stage D0 prostate cancer as evidenced by a decrease in PSA slope in this non-randomized study . Additional trials assessing the role of EGFR overexpression and Kras wild type status in prostate cancer should be investigated . Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved .\n",
