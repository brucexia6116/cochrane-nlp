The strongest evidence for efficacy has come from studies using D-cycloserine at a dose of 50 mg/day added to conventional antipsychotics in trials of 8 weeks duration or less . To assess the efficacy for negative symptoms and cognitive impairment of D-cycloserine augmentation of conventional antipsychotics in a 6-month trial . Fifty-five schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms , treated with conventional antipsychotics , were randomly assigned to treatment with D-cycloserine 50 mg/day or placebo for 6 months in a double-blind , parallel group design . Twenty-six subjects completed the 6-month trial ; drop-out rates did not differ between treatment groups . D-Cycloserine treatment did not differ from placebo treatment on any primary outcome measure at 8 or 24 weeks , including response of negative symptoms and performance on a cognitive battery . Serum D-cycloserine concentrations did not correlate with response of negative symptoms . D-Cycloserine did not exhibit therapeutic effects in this trial , possibly reflecting the high drop-out rate , a narrow range of therapeutic serum concentrations , a modest magnitude of therapeutic effect for the selected outcome measures , or loss of efficacy over time . Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist with relatively low affinity for the glycine site , the magnitude of potential therapeutic effect may be smaller than that achieved by the higher-affinity full agonists , glycine and D-serine .\n",

We investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors . In this randomized study , 10,251 patients ( mean age , 62.2 years ) with a median glycated hemoglobin level of 8.1 % were assigned to receive intensive therapy ( targeting a glycated hemoglobin level below 6.0 % ) or standard therapy ( targeting a level from 7.0 to 7.9 % ) . Of these patients , 38 % were women , and 35 % had had a previous cardiovascular event . The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , or death from cardiovascular causes . The finding of higher mortality in the intensive-therapy group led to a discontinuation of intensive therapy after a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up . At 1 year , stable median glycated hemoglobin levels of 6.4 % and 7.5 % were achieved in the intensive-therapy group and the standard-therapy group , respectively . During follow-up , the primary outcome occurred in 352 patients in the intensive-therapy group , as compared with 371 in the standard-therapy group ( hazard ratio , 0.90 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.78 to 1.04 ; P=0.16 ) . At the same time , 257 patients in the intensive-therapy group died , as compared with 203 patients in the standard-therapy group ( hazard ratio , 1.22 ; 95 % CI , 1.01 to 1.46 ; P=0.04 ) . Hypoglycemia requiring assistance and weight gain of more than 10 kg were more frequent in the intensive-therapy group ( P < 0.001 ) . As compared with standard therapy , the use of intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels for 3.5 years increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events . These findings identify a previously unrecognized harm of intensive glucose lowering in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes .

This study administered a novel immunotherapy regimen aimed at consolidating remission in these patients . Fifty-two patients with translocation positive , recurrent , or metastatic Ewing 's sarcoma family of tumors or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma underwent prechemotherapy cell harvest via apheresis for potential receipt of immunotherapy . Following completion of standard multimodal therapy , 30 patients ultimately initiated immunotherapy and were sequentially assigned to three cohorts . All cohorts received autologous T cells , influenza vaccinations , and dendritic cells pulsed with peptides derived from tumor-specific translocation breakpoints and E7 , a peptide known to bind HLA-A2 . Cohort 1 received moderate-dose recombinant human interleukin-2 ( rhIL-2 ) , cohort 2 received low-dose rhIL-2 , and cohort 3 did not receive rhIL-2 . All immunotherapy recipients generated influenza-specific immune responses , whereas immune responses to the translocation breakpoint peptides occurred in 39 % , and only 25 % of HLA-A2 ( + ) patients developed E7-specific responses . Toxicity was minimal . Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a 31 % 5-year overall survival for all patients apheresed ( median potential follow-up 7.3 years ) with a 43 % 5-year overall survival for patients initiating immunotherapy . Consolidative immunotherapy is a scientifically based and clinically practical approach for integrating immunotherapy into a multimodal regimen for chemoresponsive cancer . Patients receiving immunotherapy experienced minimal toxicity and favorable survival . The robust influenza immune responses observed suggest that postchemotherapy immune incompetence will not fundamentally limit this approach . Future studies will seek to increase efficacy by using more immunogenic antigens and more potent dendritic cells .\n",

The psychiatrist has a limited evidence base to guide treatment , particularly as there are no trials in children comparing atypical antipsychotics , the mainstay of current treatment . To compare the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and clozapine , hypothesizing that clozapine would be more efficacious . Double-blind randomized 8-week controlled trial , with a 2-year open-label follow-up . National Institute of Mental Health study , January 1998 to June 2005 . Patients underwent reassessment 2 years after discharge . Children and adolescents recruited nationally , aged 7 to 16 years , meeting unmodified DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia , and resistant to treatment with at least 2 antipsychotics . After drug washout and a 1- to 3-week antipsychotic-free period , patients were randomized to treatment with clozapine ( n = 12 ) or olanzapine ( n = 13 ) . The Clinical Global Impression Severity of Symptoms Scale and Schedule for the Assessment of Negative/Positive Symptoms . Clozapine was associated with a significant reduction in all outcome measures , whereas olanzapine showed a less consistent profile of clinical improvement . While there were moderate to large differential treatment effects in favor of clozapine , these reached significance only in the alleviation of negative symptoms from an antipsychotic-free baseline ( P = .04 ; effect size , 0.89 ) . Clozapine was associated with more overall adverse events . At 2-year follow-up , 15 patients were receiving clozapine with evidence of sustained clinical improvement , but additional adverse events emerged , including lipid anomalies ( n = 6 ) and seizures ( n = 1 ) . While not demonstrating definitively the superiority of clozapine compared with olanzapine in treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia , the study suggests that clozapine has a more favorable profile of clinical response , which is balanced against more associated adverse events .\n",

Twenty obese adolescents with obesity-related co-morbid conditions underwent measurements of body composition , glucose homeostasis by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FSIGT ) , and fasting lipids before and after 6 months treatment with orlistat 120 mg tid in conjunction with a comprehensive behavioral program . Weight ( p < 0.05 ) , BMI ( p < 0.001 ) , total cholesterol ( p < 0.001 ) , LDL cholesterol ( p < 0.001 ) , fasting insulin ( p < 0.02 ) and fasting glucose ( p < 0.003 ) were lower after treatment . Insulin sensitivity , measured during the FSIGT , improved significantly ( p < 0.02 ) , as did fasting indices such as the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance ( p < 0.01 ) . African American subjects exhibited significantly less improvement in weight ( p < 0.05 ) , BMI ( p < 0.01 ) , waist circumference ( p = 0.03 ) , and insulin sensitivity ( p = 0.05 ) . Improvements in cholesterol were not significantly different between African Americans and Caucasians . We conclude that Caucasians lost more weight and had greater improvements in insulin sensitivity than African Americans , but both exhibited improvements in plasma lipids . The true benefit of orlistat treatment over a comprehensive behavioral program remains to be determined in placebo-controlled trials .\n",

Twenty-six patients with advanced melanoma were randomly assigned to vaccination with a mixture of four gp100 and tyrosinase peptides restricted by HLA-A1 , HLA-A2 , and HLA-A3 , plus a tetanus helper peptide , either in an emulsion with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant ( Seppic Inc , Fairfield , NJ ) , or pulsed on monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( DCs ) . Systemic low-dose interleukin-2 ( Chiron , Emeryville , CA ) was given to both groups . T-lymphocyte responses were assessed , by interferon gamma ELIspot assay ( Chiron , Emeryville , CA ) , in peripheral-blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) and in a lymph node draining a vaccine site ( sentinel immunized node [ SIN ] ) . In patients vaccinated with GM-CSF in adjuvant , T-cell responses to melanoma peptides were observed in 42 % of PBLs and 80 % of SINs , but in patients vaccinated with DCs , they were observed in only 11 % and 13 % , respectively . The overall immune response was greater in the GM-CSF arm ( P < .02 ) . Vitiligo developed in two of 13 patients in the GM-CSF arm but in no patients in the DC arm . Helper T-cell responses to the tetanus peptide were detected in PBLs after vaccination and correlated with T-cell reactivity to the melanoma peptides . Objective clinical responses were observed in two patients in the GM-CSF arm and one patient in the DC arm . Stable disease was observed in two patients in the GM-CSF arm and one patient in the DC arm .

The vaccines were administered s.c. in either of two adjuvants , Montanide ISA-51 or QS-21 , to 22 patients with high-risk resected melanoma ( stage IIB-IV ) . Local and systemic toxicities were mild and transient . We detected CTL responses to the gp100 ( 280 ) peptide in peripheral blood in 14 % of patients . Helper T-cell responses to the tetanus helper peptide were detected in 79 % of patients and had a Th1 cytokine profile . One patient with a CTL response to gp100 had a recurrence in a lymph node 2 years later ; her nodes contained CD8+ cells reactive to gp100 ( 280 ) ( 0.24 % ) , which proliferated in response to peptide . The overall survival of patients is 75 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 57-94 % ) at 4.7 years follow-up , which compares favorably with expected survival . Four of 14 patients who completed at least six vaccines subsequently developed metastases , all of which were solitary and surgically resectable . They remain alive and clinically free of disease at last follow-up . Data from this trial demonstrate immunogenicity of the gp100 ( 280 ) peptide and suggest that immune responses may persist long-term in some patients . The frequency and magnitude of the CTL response may be improved with more aggressive vaccination regimens . Although this Phase I study was not intended to evaluate clinical benefit , the excellent survival of patients on this protocol suggests the possibility of a benefit that should be assessed in future studies .\n",

Healing of leg ulcers was incidentally observed during dose-ranging trials of Arginine Butyrate in beta haemoglobinopathies . Here , a controlled Phase II trial was performed in sickle cell patients who had lower extremity ulcers refractory to standard care for at least 6 months . Patients were randomized to receive standard local care alone ( Control Arm ) or standard care with Arginine Butyrate administered 5 d/week ( Treatment Arm ) , for 12 weeks . Ulcers were photographed weekly , traced , and ulcer areas were calculated by computerized planimetry and compared between the two study arms . Twenty-seven study courses were evaluated . Control Arm subjects had 25 ulcers with a mean area of 25·7 cm ( 2 ) initially and 23·2 cm ( 2 ) after 12 weeks ; 2/25 ( 8 % ) healed completely . Treatment Arm subjects had 37 ulcers with a mean area of 50·6 cm ( 2 ) initially and 28·3 cm ( 2 ) at 12 weeks ; 11/37 of these ( 30 % ) healed completely . After 3 months , proportions of ulcers which healed were 6/25 ( 24 % ) and 29/37 ( 78 % ) , in the Control and Treatment Arms respectively ( P < 0·001 ) . These findings strongly suggest that Arginine Butyrate merits further evaluation for the treatment of refractory sickle cell leg ulcers in larger trials . © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd .\n",

We conducted a randomized study involving 2166 stable patients who had total occlusion of the infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction and who met a high-risk criterion ( an ejection fraction of < 50 % or proximal occlusion ) . Of these patients , 1082 were assigned to routine PCI and stenting with optimal medical therapy , and 1084 were assigned to optimal medical therapy alone . The primary end point was a composite of death , myocardial reinfarction , or New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class IV heart failure . The 4-year cumulative primary event rate was 17.2 % in the PCI group and 15.6 % in the medical therapy group ( hazard ratio for death , reinfarction , or heart failure in the PCI group as compared with the medical therapy group , 1.16 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.92 to 1.45 ; P=0.20 ) . Rates of myocardial reinfarction ( fatal and nonfatal ) were 7.0 % and 5.3 % in the two groups , respectively ( hazard ratio , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 0.92 to 2.00 ; P=0.13 ) . Rates of nonfatal reinfarction were 6.9 % and 5.0 % , respectively ( hazard ratio , 1.44 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 to 2.16 ; P=0.08 ) ; only six reinfarctions ( 0.6 % ) were related to assigned PCI procedures . Rates of NYHA class IV heart failure ( 4.4 % vs. 4.5 % ) and death ( 9.1 % vs. 9.4 % ) were similar . There was no interaction between treatment effect and any subgroup variable ( age , sex , race or ethnic group , infarct-related artery , ejection fraction , diabetes , Killip class , and the time from myocardial infarction to randomization ) . PCI did not reduce the occurrence of death , reinfarction , or heart failure , and there was a trend toward excess reinfarction during 4 years of follow-up in stable patients with occlusion of the infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction .

At 13 clinical centers throughout the United States , we enrolled 158 patients with scleroderma , restrictive lung physiology , dyspnea , and evidence of inflammatory interstitial lung disease on examination of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid , thoracic high-resolution computed tomography , or both . Patients received oral cyclophosphamide ( < or =2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day ) or matching placebo for one year and were followed for an additional year . Pulmonary function was assessed every three months during the first year , and the primary end point was the forced vital capacity ( FVC , expressed as a percentage of the predicted value ) at 12 months , after adjustment for the baseline FVC . Of 158 patients , 145 completed at least six months of treatment and were included in the analysis . The mean absolute difference in adjusted 12-month FVC percent predicted between the cyclophosphamide and placebo groups was 2.53 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.28 to 4.79 percent ) , favoring cyclophosphamide ( P < 0.03 ) . There were also treatment-related differences in physiological and symptom outcomes , and the difference in FVC was maintained at 24 months . There was a greater frequency of adverse events in the cyclophosphamide group , but the difference between the two groups in the number of serious adverse events was not significant . One year of oral cyclophosphamide in patients with symptomatic scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease had a significant but modest beneficial effect on lung function , dyspnea , thickening of the skin , and the health-related quality of life . The effects on lung function were maintained through the 24 months of the study . Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society .\n",

Patients with carcinoma of the cervix and histologically documented para-aortic node metastases were eligible for this phase I/II trial . Chemotherapy agents were administered weekly concurrent with extended field radiation with escalating doses of paclitaxel from 30-50 mg/m ( 2 ) in each of three cohorts of three patients each . A phase II cohort was then evaluated at the selected maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) . The MTD was determined to be cisplatin 40 mg/m ( 2 ) ( maximum dose of 70 mg ) and paclitaxel 40 mg/m ( 2 ) administered weekly for six cycles concurrent with extended field radiation therapy . There were 19 evaluable patients for the phase II analysis of toxicity and efficacy . Grade three and four gastrointestinal toxicity was seen in 6 and neutropenia in 7 . Radiation therapy was successfully completed in 36.8 % of patients at eight weeks and in 68.4 % of patients at nine weeks , with a median time to completion was 56 days . A total of 27 evaluable patients were enrolled , twelve are dead ( mean survival of those deceased is 25 months ) , and 15 ( 56 % ) are alive , and have been followed for a mean of 48 months ( range 25-68 ; median of 46 months ) . Paclitaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy concurrent with extended field pelvic para-aortic irradiation can be administered at the described MTD and shows a higher than previously reported disease-free survival in relation to historical data . The 56 % survival to date , and 50 % estimated 48 month survival , warrants validation in a larger prospective cohort . Central radiation dose reduction is being considered in the next trial to decrease late toxicity of regimen .\n",

Preliminary to the trial outcome analysis , we examined the incidence of amenorrhea and its relationship to symptoms and quality of life ( QOL ) in the standard-care arm of this adjuvant breast cancer trial . Premenopausal women treated on the doxorubicin-and-cyclophosphamide-followed-by-docetaxel arm were included . Questionnaires assessing menstrual history , QOL , and symptoms were administered at baseline , day 1 of cycle 4 ( or 9 weeks from start of chemotherapy for those who stopped chemotherapy early ) , and at 6 , 12 , and 24 months . Seven hundred and eight patients were evaluable for the analysis , with median potential follow-up of 57.5 months . Of these , 321 patients also participated in the QOL substudy . Of the 708 patients , 83 % reported > or =1 episode of amenorrhea for > or =6 months . The estimated rate of resumption of menses at 24 months was 45.3 % for women < 40 years , 10.9 % for women 40-50 , and 3.2 % for women > 50 years . Those treated with tamoxifen were more likely to become amenorrheic ( p = 0.003 ) . Menstrual status was not significantly associated with QOL or symptoms . Prolonged amenorrhea is associated with a regimen that contains doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , and docetaxel , and is age dependent and impacted by tamoxifen use . Vasomotor symptoms are common in this patient population but are not associated with menstrual status . These results can be used to inform premenopausal women about the risk and time course of amenorrhea associated with this common adjuvant therapy regimen , along with the effects on symptoms and QOL .\n",

A multi-center phase 2 trial was conducted that added intravenous pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( day 8 ; 30-40 mg/m ( 2 ) ) to a regimen of intraperitoneal cisplatin ( day 2 ; 75 mg/m ( 2 ) ) and intravenous ( day 1 ; 135 mg/m ( 2 ) ) plus intraperitoneal ( day 8 ; 60 mg/m ( 2 ) ) paclitaxel . Treatment was initially delivered on an every 3-week schedule , but was modified to an every 4-week program due to excessive toxicity . Patients were to receive 6 cycles of this regimen . Of 68 patients entering this trial , 63 patients were eligible and evaluable , of whom 39 ( 62 % ) completed 6 cycles . Overall , 32 ( 51 % ) experienced at least 1 grade 4 or worse toxicity ( most commonly hematologic ) including 5 treatment-related deaths . Median progression-free survival ( PFS ) was 25 months ( 2-year PFS : 52 % ) and median overall survival 51 months , an outcome similar to previous reports of cisplatin-based intraperitoneal chemotherapy in comparable patient populations . Seventeen patients ( 27 % of all eligible patients ) were without evidence of disease recurrence > 4 years following entry into the trial . Both the overall trial outcome , and specifically the excessively severe systemic toxicity of this regimen would prevent its future development in this exact form . The provocative PFS in a subset of individuals should encourage the development of alternative strategies designed to optimize the delivery of regional therapy in ovarian cancer management .\n",

Adolescents ( 206 females and 114 males ) completed two 3-d physical activity recalls using the AB and TB surveys , which contained identical lists of physical activities . The participants wore an MTI Actigraph accelerometer for the same period . The TB instrument took about 3 min longer to complete ( P = 0.022 ) . Overall 2-d test-retest correlations for MVPA were similar for the two surveys ( r = 0.676 and 0.667 ) , but the girls had higher reliability on the AB survey than the boys ( girls : r = 0.713 ; boys : r = 0.568 ) . The overall 3-d correlations for MVPA surveys and Actigraph counts varied by gender ( girls : AB = 0.265 vs TB = 0.314 ; boys : AB = 0.340 vs TB = 0.277 ) . Correlations for vigorous physical activity and Actigraph counts were higher for the AB than for the TB ( r = 0.281 vs 0.162 ) . As the interval between completing the surveys and the days being recalled increased , reliability and validity were lower , especially for the AB survey . For both genders , either approach is acceptable for obtaining MVPA information on a single day , but the TB approach appears to be slightly favored over the AB approach for obtaining multiple days of MVPA . A 3-d recall period appears to be too long for accurate recall of MVPA information from either instrument . For both genders , the surveys overestimated activity levels ; thus , self-reports should be supplemented with objective data .\n",

For patients in whom optimal debulking can not be achieved , one could incorporate IP therapy post-operatively if the cancer was optimally debulked following neoadjuvant chemotherapy . We sought to evaluate overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , percent of patients optimally debulked and toxicity in patients treated with this strategy . Women with adenocarcinoma by biopsy or cytology with stage III/IV ( pleural effusions only ) epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma that presented with bulky disease were treated with neoadjuvant intravenous ( IV ) paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6 q 21 daysx3 cycles followed by surgery ( if > /=50 % decrease in CA125 ) . If optimally debulked they received IV paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 and IP carboplatin AUC 5 ( day 1 ) and IP paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 ( day 8 ) q 28 daysx6 cycles . Sixty-two patients were registered . Four were ineligible . Fifty-six were evaluated for neoadjuvant chemotherapy toxicities . One patient died of pneumonia . Five patients had grade 4 toxicity , including neutropenia ( 3 ) , anemia , leukopenia , anorexia , fatigue , muscle weakness , respiratory infection , and cardiac ischemia . Thirty-six patients had debulking surgery . Two had grade 4 hemorrhage . Twenty-six patients received post-cytoreduction chemotherapy . Four had grade 4 neutropenia . At a median follow-up of 21 months , median PFS is 21 months and median OS is 32 months for all 58 patients . PFS and OS for the 26 patients who received IV/IP chemotherapy is 29 and 34 months respectively . These results compare favorably with other studies of sub-optimally debulked patients .\n",

This report presents the results of part 2 . Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0116 was a 2-part trial . Part 1 delivered extended-field irradiation , brachytherapy , and cisplatin ; part 2 added amifostine and required 16 evaluable patients to assess an improved toxicity profile . Eligibility included evidence for high common iliac or para-aortic metastasis . Patients were treated for a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions with intracavitary irradiation . Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was not allowed . The final point A dose was 85 Gy low-dose rate equivalent . High-dose rate techniques were allowed . The positive para-aortic and iliac nodes were to be boosted to 54 to 59.4 Gy . Amifostine at 500 mg was to be delivered with every fraction of radiotherapy . The study opened on August 1 , 2001 , and closed March 3 , 2007 , after accruing 45 patients , 18 for the second part with amifostine . This analysis reports the primary end point for the patients entered on part 2 of the study . Three patients were excluded , one was ineligible , and 2 withdrew . The median follow-up was 22.9 months ( range , 6.5-45.4 months ) . The median dose of amifostine delivered was 5000 mg ( range , 500-13,500 mg ) . Thirteen patients ( 87 % ) experienced an acute grade 3/4 toxicity ( excluding grade 3 leukopenia ) . This compared to an 81 % rate in part 1 of the trial . The estimated median survival was 34.8 months with a 20 % late grade 3/4 toxicity rate . Amifostine , as delivered in this study , did not reduce acute toxicity in this patient population .\n",

We sought to measure adherence among women randomly assigned to capecitabine in a preplanned substudy of a multicenter clinical trial . Cancer and Leukemia Group B study CALGB 49907 was a randomly assigned trial comparing standard chemotherapy versus oral chemotherapy with capecitabine in patients age 65 years or older with early-stage breast cancer . We used microelectronic monitoring system ( MEMS ) caps on participants ' capecitabine bottles to record pill bottle openings . Capecitabine was given in two divided daily doses for 14 consecutive days of a 21-day cycle for six cycles . Adherence was calculated as the number of doses taken divided by doses expected , taking into account toxicity-related dosing changes . A participant was defined as adherent if 80 % or more of expected doses were recorded by MEMS . Overall , 161 patients were enrolled . Median age was 71 years ( range , 65 to 89 years ) ; 124 patients ( 83 % ) persisted with capecitabine to completion of planned protocol therapy . Adherence was 78 % across all cycles , and adherence did not vary by cycle ( P = .32 ) . Twenty-five percent of participants took fewer than 80 % of expected doses and were nonadherent . In a logistic regression model , participants with node-negative disease ( P = .01 ) and mastectomy ( P = .01 ) were more likely to be nonadherent . Adherence was not related to age , tumor stage , or hormone receptor status . Adherence was not significantly associated with relapse-free survival or grade 3 or 4 toxicity . Most older women with early-stage breast cancer were adherent to short-term oral chemotherapy in a randomized clinical trial . Age was not associated with adherence .\n",

For HER2-positive patients , additional benefit may occur with the addition of trastuzumab due to its synergy with docetaxel and vinorelbine . Patients with HER2-positive MBC , but without prior chemotherapy for MBC or adjuvant taxane , were eligible . Docetaxel ( 60 mg/m² ) was given intravenously on Day 1 , vinorelbine ( 27.5 mg/m² ) intravenously on Days 8 and 15 , and filgrastim ( 5 µg/kg ) on Days 2-21 of a 21-day cycle . In addition , patients received weekly infusions of trastuzumab ( 2 mg/kg ) after an initial bolus of 4 mg/kg . The primary outcome was 1 year overall survival ( OS ) , with secondary outcomes of progression-free survival ( PFS ) , response rate , and toxicity . Due to slow accrual ( February 2003-December 2006 ) , enrollment was stopped after 76 of 90 planned patients . There have been 32 deaths and 51 progressions among the 74 eligible patients who received treatment . The estimated 1 year OS was 93 % ( 95 % CI 84-97 % ) with a median of 48 months . One-year PFS was 70 % ( 95 % CI 58-79 % ) with a median of 20 months . Response rate for measurable disease was 84 % . No deaths were attributed to treatment . Grade 4 toxicities were reported for 19 % with neutropenia the most common ( 15 % ) . The most common grade 3 toxicities ( 33 % ) were leucopenia ( 14 % ) and fatigue ( 10 % ) . The combination of trastuzumab , docetaxel , and vinorelbine is effective as first-line chemotherapy in HER2-positive MBC with minimal toxicity . One-year survival estimates are among the highest reported in this population .\n",

In postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density ( BMD ) , subcutaneous denosumab decreases bone resorption and increases BMD . This post hoc analysis reports on subjects treated for up to 24 months with denosumab 60mg 6 monthly ( N=39 ) , placebo ( N=39 ) , or open-label alendronate 70mg once weekly ( N=38 ) in a phase 2 study . Hip scans were done by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline , 12 , and 24 months ; these were analyzed with hip structural analysis software to evaluate BMD and cross-sectional geometry parameters at the narrowest segment of the femoral neck , the intertrochanter , and the proximal shaft . Geometric parameters and derived strength indices included bone cross-sectional area , section modulus , and buckling ratio . At 12 and 24 months denosumab and alendronate improved these parameters compared with placebo . Denosumab effects were greater than alendronate at the intertrochanteric and shaft sites . The magnitude and direction of the changes in structural geometry parameters observed in this study suggest that denosumab treatment may lead to improved bone mechanical properties . Ongoing phase 3 studies will determine whether denosumab reduces fracture risk .\n",

Ixabepilone has single-agent activity in these patients and has demonstrated synergy with capecitabine in this setting . This study was designed to compare ixabepilone plus capecitabine versus capecitabine alone in anthracycline-pretreated or -resistant and taxane-resistant locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer . Seven hundred fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to ixabepilone 40 mg/m ( 2 ) intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle plus capecitabine 2,000 mg/m ( 2 ) orally on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle , or capecitabine alone 2,500 mg/m ( 2 ) on the same schedule , in this international phase III study . The primary end point was progression-free survival evaluated by blinded independent review . Ixabepilone plus capecitabine prolonged progression-free survival relative to capecitabine ( median , 5.8 v 4.2 months ) , with a 25 % reduction in the estimated risk of disease progression ( hazard ratio , 0.75 ; 95 % CI , 0.64 to 0.88 ; P = .0003 ) . Objective response rate was also increased ( 35 % v 14 % ; P < .0001 ) . Grade 3/4 treatment-related sensory neuropathy ( 21 % v 0 % ) , fatigue ( 9 % v 3 % ) , and neutropenia ( 68 % v 11 % ) were more frequent with combination therapy , as was the rate of death as a result of toxicity ( 3 % v 1 % , with patients with liver dysfunction [ > /= grade 2 liver function tests ] at greater risk ) . Capecitabine-related toxicities were similar for both treatment groups . Ixabepilone plus capecitabine demonstrates superior efficacy to capecitabine alone in patients with metastatic breast cancer pretreated or resistant to anthracyclines and resistant to taxanes .\n",

A randomized trial , Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 9902 , was undertaken to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel , estramustine , and etoposide ( TEE ) plus AS+RT would improve disease outcomes with acceptable toxicity . High-risk ( prostate-specific antigen 20-100 ng/mL and Gleason score > or=7 ; or Stage T2 or greater , Gleason score 8 , prostate-specific antigen level < 100 ng/mL ) nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients were randomized to AS+RT ( Arm 1 ) vs. AS+RT plus four cycles of TEE ( Arm 2 ) . TEE was delivered 4 weeks after RT . AS continued for 2 years for both treatment arms . RT began after 8 weeks of AS began . The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9902 trial opened January 11 , 2000 . Excess thromboembolic toxicity was noted , leading to study closure October 4 , 2004 . A total of 397 patients were accrued , and the data for 381 were analyzable . An acute and long-term toxicity analysis was performed . The worst overall toxicities during treatment were increased for Arm 2 . Of the 192 patients , 136 ( 71 % ) on Arm 2 had RTOG Grade 3 or greater toxicity compared with 70 ( 37 % ) of 189 patients on Arm 1 . Statistically significant increases in hematologic toxicity ( p < 0.0001 ) and gastrointestinal toxicity ( p = 0.017 ) but not genitourinary toxicity ( p = 0.07 ) were noted during treatment . Two Grade 5 complications related to neutropenic infection occurred in Arm 2 . Three cases of myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia were noted in Arm 2 . At 2 and 3 years after therapy completion , excess long-term toxicity was not observed in Arm 2 . TEE was associated with significantly increased toxicity during treatment . The toxicity profiles did not differ at 2 and 3 years after therapy . Toxicity is an important consideration in the design of trials using adjuvant chemotherapy for prostate cancer .\n",

A total of 159 patients were enrolled in a double-blind randomized trial to determine if thalidomide can improve the efficacy of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in hormone responsive patients with an increasing prostate specific antigen after primary definitive therapy for prostate cancer . Patients were randomized to 6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist followed by 200 mg per day oral thalidomide or placebo ( oral phase A ) . At the time of prostate specific antigen progression gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist was restarted for 6 additional months . Patients were then crossed over to the opposite drug and were treated until prostate specific antigen progression ( oral phase B ) . Testosterone and dihydroxytestosterone were likewise monitored throughout the study . During oral phase A the median time to prostate specific antigen progression was 15 months for the thalidomide group compared to 9.6 months on placebo ( p = 0.21 ) . The median time to prostate specific antigen progression during oral phase B for the thalidomide group was 17.1 vs 6.6 months on placebo ( p = 0.0002 ) . No differences in time to serum testosterone normalization between the thalidomide and placebo arms were documented during oral phase A and oral phase B. Thalidomide was tolerable although dose reductions occurred in 47 % ( 58 of 124 ) of patients . Despite thalidomide having no effect on testosterone normalization , there was a clear effect on prostate specific antigen progression during oral phase B . This is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate the effects of thalidomide using intermittent hormonal therapy .\n",

A phase III study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sipuleucel-T in a placebo-controlled study . A total of 127 patients with asymptomatic metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive three infusions of sipuleucel-T ( n = 82 ) or placebo ( n = 45 ) every 2 weeks . On disease progression , placebo patients could receive APC8015F , a product made with frozen leukapheresis cells . Of the 127 patients , 115 patients had progressive disease at the time of data analysis , and all patients were followed for survival for 36 months . The median for time to disease progression ( TTP ) for sipuleucel-T was 11.7 weeks compared with 10.0 weeks for placebo ( P = .052 , log-rank ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.45 ; 95 % CI , 0.99 to 2.11 ) . Median survival was 25.9 months for sipuleucel-T and 21.4 months for placebo ( P = .01 , log-rank ; HR , 1.70 ; 95 % CI , 1.13 to 2.56 ) . Treatment remained a strong independent predictor of overall survival after adjusting for prognostic factors using a Cox multivariable regression model ( P = .002 , Wald test ; HR , 2.12 ; 95 % CI , 1.31 to 3.44 ) . The median ratio of T-cell stimulation at 8 weeks to pretreatment was eight-fold higher in sipuleucel-T-treated patients ( 16.9 v 1.99 ; P < .001 ) . Sipuleucel-T therapy was well tolerated . While the improvement in the primary end point TTP did not achieve statistical significance , this study suggests that sipuleucel-T may provide a survival advantage to asymptomatic HRPC patients .

In light of the significant sequelae of prostate cancer treatment , prevention is desirable , and men with HGPIN would be suitable , high-risk subjects . There is in vitro , in vivo , epidemiologic , and human experimental evidence that selenium supplementation may protect against prostate cancer . This article introduces the rationale for , and progress to date , of a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial of selenium supplementation ( 200 mug/d in the form of selenomethionine ) , to prevent the development of prostate cancer among men with HGPIN .

Patients with localized prostate cancer received amifostine as a rectal suspension 30-45 minutes before daily three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy . The first 18 patients received 1 g of amifostine , and the next 12 patients received 2 g. Toxicity was assessed at baseline , during treatment , and at follow-up visits by using RTOG grading and the EPIC Quality of Life ( QoL ) 50-item questionnaire . The Bowel Function subset of the bowel domain ( EPIC-BF ) , which targets symptom severity , and the Bowel Bother subset of the bowel domain ( EPIC-BB ) , which assesses QoL , were evaluated and compared with the RTOG GI toxicity score . Median follow-up was 30 months ( range , 18-36 months ) . Overall , EPIC-BF and EPIC-BB scores both tracked closely with the RTOG GI toxicity score . Seven weeks after the start of radiation therapy , the incidence of RTOG Grade 2 toxicity was 33 % in the 1-g group ( 6/18 patients ) compared with 0 % ( 0/12 patients ) in the 2-g group and tended toward statistical significance ( p = 0.06 ) . A significant difference between amifostine groups was observed using the EPIC-BF score at 7 weeks ( p = 0.04 ) . A difference in EPIC-BB scores between dose groups was evident at 7 weeks ( p = 0.07 ) and was significant at 12 months ( p = 0.04 ) . Higher doses of amifostine produced significant improvements in acute and late bowel QoL ( up to 1 year after therapy ) , measured using the EPIC score .\n",

This phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of earlier treatment with zoledronic acid in men with castration-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer . Men with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastases whose androgen-deprivation therapy was initiated within 6 months of study entry were randomly assigned in a blinded 1:1 ratio to receive zoledronic acid ( 4 mg intravenously every 4 weeks ) or a placebo . After their disease progressed to castration-resistant status , all patients received open-label treatment with zoledronic acid . The primary end point was time to first SRE , defined as radiation to bone , clinical fracture , spinal cord compression , surgery to bone , or death as a result of prostate cancer . Target accrual was 680 patients . Primary analysis was planned after 470 SREs . The study was discontinued prematurely ( 645 patients ; 299 SREs ) after the corporate supporter withdrew study drug supply . Early zoledronic acid was not associated with increased time to first SRE . The median time to first SRE was 31.9 months in the zoledronic acid group ( 95 % CI , 24.2 to 40.3 ) and 29.8 months in the placebo group ( 95 % CI , 25.3 to 37.2 ; hazard ratio , 0.97 ; 95 % CI , 0 to 1.17 ; one-sided stratified log-rank P = .39 ) . Overall survival was similar between the groups ( hazard ratio , 0.88 ; 95 % CI , 0.70 to 1.12 ; P = .29 ) . Rates of adverse events were similar between the groups . In men with castration-sensitive prostate cancer and bone metastases , early treatment with zoledronic acid was not associated with lower risk for SREs .\n",

Replacement of T in hypogonadal men improves several bone parameters . Replacement of GH in GH-deficient men improves BMD . Our objective was to determine whether T and GH treatment together improves the structural and mechanical parameters of bone more than T alone in men with hypopituitarism . This randomized , prospective , 2-year study included 32 men with severe deficiencies of T and GH due to panhypopituitarism . Subjects were randomized to receive T alone ( n = 15 ) or T and GH ( n = 17 ) for 2 years . We evaluated magnetic resonance microimaging-derived structural ( bone volume fraction [ BVF ] and trabecular thickness ) and mechanical ( axial stiffness [ AS ] , a measure of bone strength ) properties of the distal tibia at baseline and after 1 and 2 years of treatment . Treatment with T and GH did not affect BVF , thickness , or AS differently from T alone . T treatment in all subjects for 2 years increased trabecular BVF by 9.6 % ( P < .0001 ) , trabecular thickness by 2.6 % ( P < .001 ) , and trabecular AS by 9.8 % ( P < .001 ) . In contrast , testosterone treatment in all subjects significantly increased cortical thickness by 2.4 % ( P < .01 ) but decreased cortical BVF by -4.7 % ( P < .01 ) and cortical AS by -6.9 % ( P < .01 ) . Combined T and GH treatment of men with hypopituitarism for 2 years did not improve the measured structural or mechanical parameters of the distal tibia more than T alone . However , testosterone significantly increased the structural and mechanical properties of trabecular bone but decreased most of these properties of cortical bone , illustrating the potential importance of assessing trabecular and cortical bone separately in future studies of the effect of testosterone on bone .\n",

Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics , toxicity analysis and overall survival . The study was an open-label , phase II , two-stage design , focusing on the results from the second stage , as criteria for progression were modified after completing the first stage . Sorafenib was given at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles . Clinical and laboratory assessments were done every 4 weeks , and radiographic scans were obtained every 8 weeks . Twenty-four patients were accrued in the second stage ; the median ( range ) age was 66 ( 49-85 ) years , the on-study prostate-specific antigen level was 68.45 ( 5.8-995 ) ng/mL , the Gleason score 8 ( 6-9 ) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 1 ( in 17 patients ) . Of the 24 patients , 21 had previous chemotherapy with docetaxel . All patients had bony metastases , either alone ( in 11 ) or with soft-tissue disease ( in 13 ) . One patient had a partial response ; 10 patients had stable disease ( median duration 18 weeks , range 15-48 ) . At a median potential follow-up of 27.2 months , the median progression-free survival was 3.7 months and the median overall survival was 18.0 months . For the whole trial of 46 patients the median survival was 18.3 months . Most frequent toxicities included hand-foot skin reaction ( grade 2 in nine patients , grade 3 in three ) , rash , abnormalities in liver function tests , and fatigue . Sorafenib has moderate activity as a second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer .\n",

      "X-linked retinitis pigmentosa is a severe inherited retinal degenerative disease with a frequency of 1 in 100,000 persons . Because no cure is available for this orphan disease and treatment options are limited , slowing of disease progression would be a meaningful outcome . To determine whether high-dose docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , an ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , slows progression of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa measured by cone electroretinography ( ERG ) . A 4-year , single-site , randomized , placebo-controlled , double-masked phase 2 clinical trial at a research center specializing in medical retina . Seventy-eight male patients diagnosed as having X-linked retinitis pigmentosa were randomized to DHA or placebo . Data were omitted for 2 patients with non-X-linked retinitis pigmentosa and 16 patients who were unable to follow protocol during the first year . The remaining participants were tested annually and composed a modified intent-to-treat cohort ( DHA group , n = 33 ; placebo group , n = 27 ) . All participants received a multivitamin and were randomly assigned to oral DHA ( 30 mg/kg/d ) or placebo . The primary outcome was the rate of loss of cone ERG function . Secondary outcomes were rod and maximal ERG amplitudes and cone ERG implicit times . Capsule counts and red blood cell DHA levels were assessed to monitor adherence . Average ( 6-month to 4-year ) red blood cell DHA levels were 4-fold higher in the DHA group than in the placebo group ( P < .001 ) . There was no difference between the DHA and placebo groups in the rate of cone ERG functional loss ( 0.028 vs 0.022 log µV/y , respectively ; P = .30 ) . No group differences were evident for change in rod ERG ( P = .27 ) , maximal ERG ( P = .65 ) , or cone implicit time ( no change over 4 years ) . The rate of cone loss ( ie , event rate ) was markedly reduced compared with rates in previous studies . No severe treatment-emergent adverse events were found . Long-term DHA supplementation was not effective in slowing the loss of cone or rod ERG function associated with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa . Participant dropout and lower-than-expected disease event rate limited power to detect statistical significance . A larger sample size , longer trial , and attainment of a target blood DHA level ( 13 % ) would be desirable . While DHA supplementation at 30 mg/kg/d does not present serious adverse effects , routine monitoring of gastrointestinal tolerance is prudent . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00100230 .\n",

This study evaluated the potential activity of lapatinib in men with biochemically-relapsed androgen-dependent ( stage D0 ) prostate cancer . Patients with a rising PSA after primary therapy for prostate cancer were enrolled . A PSA doubling time ( PSADT ) < 12 months was required . Lapatinib was administered at 1,500 mg orally daily . Outcome measures were changes in PSA kinetics . Primary tumor blocks were obtained and assessed for EGFR expression , EGFR Q787Q polymorphism , and Kras 38 mutational status . Forty-nine patients were enrolled ( 14 ineligible ) , resulting in 35 patients for analysis . No PSA response was observed ; best response was stable disease ( n = 28 , 80.0 % ) . Pretreatment average slope was 0.19 log ( PSA ) /month ( PSADT = 3.70 months ) , in contrast to on-treatment average slope of 0.13 log ( PSA ) /month ( PSADT = 5.44 months ) using linear mixed effects models ( P = 0.006 ) . Median progression-free survival ( PFS ) was 17.4 months for the high EGFR group and 6.0 months for the low EGFR group ( P = 0.50 ) . Patients with Kras 38 mutation had shorter PFS than those without Kras 38 mutation ( P = 0.09 ) . Although no PSA responses ( primary endpoint ) was observed , lapatinib may have biologic activity in men with stage D0 prostate cancer as evidenced by a decrease in PSA slope in this non-randomized study . Additional trials assessing the role of EGFR overexpression and Kras wild type status in prostate cancer should be investigated . Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved .\n",
