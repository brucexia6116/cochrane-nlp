The strongest evidence for efficacy has come from studies using D-cycloserine at a dose of 50 mg/day added to conventional antipsychotics in trials of 8 weeks duration or less . To assess the efficacy for negative symptoms and cognitive impairment of D-cycloserine augmentation of conventional antipsychotics in a 6-month trial . Fifty-five schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms , treated with conventional antipsychotics , were randomly assigned to treatment with D-cycloserine 50 mg/day or placebo for 6 months in a double-blind , parallel group design . Twenty-six subjects completed the 6-month trial ; drop-out rates did not differ between treatment groups . D-Cycloserine treatment did not differ from placebo treatment on any primary outcome measure at 8 or 24 weeks , including response of negative symptoms and performance on a cognitive battery . Serum D-cycloserine concentrations did not correlate with response of negative symptoms . D-Cycloserine did not exhibit therapeutic effects in this trial , possibly reflecting the high drop-out rate , a narrow range of therapeutic serum concentrations , a modest magnitude of therapeutic effect for the selected outcome measures , or loss of efficacy over time . Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist with relatively low affinity for the glycine site , the magnitude of potential therapeutic effect may be smaller than that achieved by the higher-affinity full agonists , glycine and D-serine .\n",

We investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors . In this randomized study , 10,251 patients ( mean age , 62.2 years ) with a median glycated hemoglobin level of 8.1 % were assigned to receive intensive therapy ( targeting a glycated hemoglobin level below 6.0 % ) or standard therapy ( targeting a level from 7.0 to 7.9 % ) . Of these patients , 38 % were women , and 35 % had had a previous cardiovascular event . The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , or death from cardiovascular causes . The finding of higher mortality in the intensive-therapy group led to a discontinuation of intensive therapy after a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up . At 1 year , stable median glycated hemoglobin levels of 6.4 % and 7.5 % were achieved in the intensive-therapy group and the standard-therapy group , respectively . During follow-up , the primary outcome occurred in 352 patients in the intensive-therapy group , as compared with 371 in the standard-therapy group ( hazard ratio , 0.90 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.78 to 1.04 ; P=0.16 ) . At the same time , 257 patients in the intensive-therapy group died , as compared with 203 patients in the standard-therapy group ( hazard ratio , 1.22 ; 95 % CI , 1.01 to 1.46 ; P=0.04 ) . Hypoglycemia requiring assistance and weight gain of more than 10 kg were more frequent in the intensive-therapy group ( P < 0.001 ) . As compared with standard therapy , the use of intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels for 3.5 years increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events . These findings identify a previously unrecognized harm of intensive glucose lowering in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes .

This study administered a novel immunotherapy regimen aimed at consolidating remission in these patients . Fifty-two patients with translocation positive , recurrent , or metastatic Ewing 's sarcoma family of tumors or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma underwent prechemotherapy cell harvest via apheresis for potential receipt of immunotherapy . Following completion of standard multimodal therapy , 30 patients ultimately initiated immunotherapy and were sequentially assigned to three cohorts . All cohorts received autologous T cells , influenza vaccinations , and dendritic cells pulsed with peptides derived from tumor-specific translocation breakpoints and E7 , a peptide known to bind HLA-A2 . Cohort 1 received moderate-dose recombinant human interleukin-2 ( rhIL-2 ) , cohort 2 received low-dose rhIL-2 , and cohort 3 did not receive rhIL-2 . All immunotherapy recipients generated influenza-specific immune responses , whereas immune responses to the translocation breakpoint peptides occurred in 39 % , and only 25 % of HLA-A2 ( + ) patients developed E7-specific responses . Toxicity was minimal . Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a 31 % 5-year overall survival for all patients apheresed ( median potential follow-up 7.3 years ) with a 43 % 5-year overall survival for patients initiating immunotherapy . Consolidative immunotherapy is a scientifically based and clinically practical approach for integrating immunotherapy into a multimodal regimen for chemoresponsive cancer . Patients receiving immunotherapy experienced minimal toxicity and favorable survival . The robust influenza immune responses observed suggest that postchemotherapy immune incompetence will not fundamentally limit this approach . Future studies will seek to increase efficacy by using more immunogenic antigens and more potent dendritic cells .\n",

The psychiatrist has a limited evidence base to guide treatment , particularly as there are no trials in children comparing atypical antipsychotics , the mainstay of current treatment . To compare the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and clozapine , hypothesizing that clozapine would be more efficacious . Double-blind randomized 8-week controlled trial , with a 2-year open-label follow-up . National Institute of Mental Health study , January 1998 to June 2005 . Patients underwent reassessment 2 years after discharge . Children and adolescents recruited nationally , aged 7 to 16 years , meeting unmodified DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia , and resistant to treatment with at least 2 antipsychotics . After drug washout and a 1- to 3-week antipsychotic-free period , patients were randomized to treatment with clozapine ( n = 12 ) or olanzapine ( n = 13 ) . The Clinical Global Impression Severity of Symptoms Scale and Schedule for the Assessment of Negative/Positive Symptoms . Clozapine was associated with a significant reduction in all outcome measures , whereas olanzapine showed a less consistent profile of clinical improvement . While there were moderate to large differential treatment effects in favor of clozapine , these reached significance only in the alleviation of negative symptoms from an antipsychotic-free baseline ( P = .04 ; effect size , 0.89 ) . Clozapine was associated with more overall adverse events . At 2-year follow-up , 15 patients were receiving clozapine with evidence of sustained clinical improvement , but additional adverse events emerged , including lipid anomalies ( n = 6 ) and seizures ( n = 1 ) . While not demonstrating definitively the superiority of clozapine compared with olanzapine in treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia , the study suggests that clozapine has a more favorable profile of clinical response , which is balanced against more associated adverse events .\n",

Twenty obese adolescents with obesity-related co-morbid conditions underwent measurements of body composition , glucose homeostasis by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FSIGT ) , and fasting lipids before and after 6 months treatment with orlistat 120 mg tid in conjunction with a comprehensive behavioral program . Weight ( p < 0.05 ) , BMI ( p < 0.001 ) , total cholesterol ( p < 0.001 ) , LDL cholesterol ( p < 0.001 ) , fasting insulin ( p < 0.02 ) and fasting glucose ( p < 0.003 ) were lower after treatment . Insulin sensitivity , measured during the FSIGT , improved significantly ( p < 0.02 ) , as did fasting indices such as the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance ( p < 0.01 ) . African American subjects exhibited significantly less improvement in weight ( p < 0.05 ) , BMI ( p < 0.01 ) , waist circumference ( p = 0.03 ) , and insulin sensitivity ( p = 0.05 ) . Improvements in cholesterol were not significantly different between African Americans and Caucasians . We conclude that Caucasians lost more weight and had greater improvements in insulin sensitivity than African Americans , but both exhibited improvements in plasma lipids . The true benefit of orlistat treatment over a comprehensive behavioral program remains to be determined in placebo-controlled trials .\n",

Twenty-six patients with advanced melanoma were randomly assigned to vaccination with a mixture of four gp100 and tyrosinase peptides restricted by HLA-A1 , HLA-A2 , and HLA-A3 , plus a tetanus helper peptide , either in an emulsion with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant ( Seppic Inc , Fairfield , NJ ) , or pulsed on monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( DCs ) . Systemic low-dose interleukin-2 ( Chiron , Emeryville , CA ) was given to both groups . T-lymphocyte responses were assessed , by interferon gamma ELIspot assay ( Chiron , Emeryville , CA ) , in peripheral-blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) and in a lymph node draining a vaccine site ( sentinel immunized node [ SIN ] ) . In patients vaccinated with GM-CSF in adjuvant , T-cell responses to melanoma peptides were observed in 42 % of PBLs and 80 % of SINs , but in patients vaccinated with DCs , they were observed in only 11 % and 13 % , respectively . The overall immune response was greater in the GM-CSF arm ( P < .02 ) . Vitiligo developed in two of 13 patients in the GM-CSF arm but in no patients in the DC arm . Helper T-cell responses to the tetanus peptide were detected in PBLs after vaccination and correlated with T-cell reactivity to the melanoma peptides . Objective clinical responses were observed in two patients in the GM-CSF arm and one patient in the DC arm . Stable disease was observed in two patients in the GM-CSF arm and one patient in the DC arm . The high frequency of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses and the occurrence of clinical tumor regressions support continued investigation of multipeptide vaccines administered with GM-CSF in adjuvant .\n",

The vaccines were administered s.c. in either of two adjuvants , Montanide ISA-51 or QS-21 , to 22 patients with high-risk resected melanoma ( stage IIB-IV ) . Local and systemic toxicities were mild and transient . We detected CTL responses to the gp100 ( 280 ) peptide in peripheral blood in 14 % of patients . Helper T-cell responses to the tetanus helper peptide were detected in 79 % of patients and had a Th1 cytokine profile . One patient with a CTL response to gp100 had a recurrence in a lymph node 2 years later ; her nodes contained CD8+ cells reactive to gp100 ( 280 ) ( 0.24 % ) , which proliferated in response to peptide . The overall survival of patients is 75 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 57-94 % ) at 4.7 years follow-up , which compares favorably with expected survival . Four of 14 patients who completed at least six vaccines subsequently developed metastases , all of which were solitary and surgically resectable . They remain alive and clinically free of disease at last follow-up . Data from this trial demonstrate immunogenicity of the gp100 ( 280 ) peptide and suggest that immune responses may persist long-term in some patients . The frequency and magnitude of the CTL response may be improved with more aggressive vaccination regimens . Although this Phase I study was not intended to evaluate clinical benefit , the excellent survival of patients on this protocol suggests the possibility of a benefit that should be assessed in future studies .\n",

Healing of leg ulcers was incidentally observed during dose-ranging trials of Arginine Butyrate in beta haemoglobinopathies . Here , a controlled Phase II trial was performed in sickle cell patients who had lower extremity ulcers refractory to standard care for at least 6 months . Patients were randomized to receive standard local care alone ( Control Arm ) or standard care with Arginine Butyrate administered 5 d/week ( Treatment Arm ) , for 12 weeks . Ulcers were photographed weekly , traced , and ulcer areas were calculated by computerized planimetry and compared between the two study arms . Twenty-seven study courses were evaluated . Control Arm subjects had 25 ulcers with a mean area of 25·7 cm ( 2 ) initially and 23·2 cm ( 2 ) after 12 weeks ; 2/25 ( 8 % ) healed completely . Treatment Arm subjects had 37 ulcers with a mean area of 50·6 cm ( 2 ) initially and 28·3 cm ( 2 ) at 12 weeks ; 11/37 of these ( 30 % ) healed completely . After 3 months , proportions of ulcers which healed were 6/25 ( 24 % ) and 29/37 ( 78 % ) , in the Control and Treatment Arms respectively ( P < 0·001 ) . These findings strongly suggest that Arginine Butyrate merits further evaluation for the treatment of refractory sickle cell leg ulcers in larger trials . © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd .\n",

We conducted a randomized study involving 2166 stable patients who had total occlusion of the infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction and who met a high-risk criterion ( an ejection fraction of < 50 % or proximal occlusion ) . Of these patients , 1082 were assigned to routine PCI and stenting with optimal medical therapy , and 1084 were assigned to optimal medical therapy alone . The primary end point was a composite of death , myocardial reinfarction , or New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class IV heart failure . The 4-year cumulative primary event rate was 17.2 % in the PCI group and 15.6 % in the medical therapy group ( hazard ratio for death , reinfarction , or heart failure in the PCI group as compared with the medical therapy group , 1.16 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.92 to 1.45 ; P=0.20 ) . Rates of myocardial reinfarction ( fatal and nonfatal ) were 7.0 % and 5.3 % in the two groups , respectively ( hazard ratio , 1.36 ; 95 % CI , 0.92 to 2.00 ; P=0.13 ) . Rates of nonfatal reinfarction were 6.9 % and 5.0 % , respectively ( hazard ratio , 1.44 ; 95 % CI , 0.96 to 2.16 ; P=0.08 ) ; only six reinfarctions ( 0.6 % ) were related to assigned PCI procedures . Rates of NYHA class IV heart failure ( 4.4 % vs. 4.5 % ) and death ( 9.1 % vs. 9.4 % ) were similar . There was no interaction between treatment effect and any subgroup variable ( age , sex , race or ethnic group , infarct-related artery , ejection fraction , diabetes , Killip class , and the time from myocardial infarction to randomization ) . PCI did not reduce the occurrence of death , reinfarction , or heart failure , and there was a trend toward excess reinfarction during 4 years of follow-up in stable patients with occlusion of the infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction .

At 13 clinical centers throughout the United States , we enrolled 158 patients with scleroderma , restrictive lung physiology , dyspnea , and evidence of inflammatory interstitial lung disease on examination of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid , thoracic high-resolution computed tomography , or both . Patients received oral cyclophosphamide ( < or =2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day ) or matching placebo for one year and were followed for an additional year . Pulmonary function was assessed every three months during the first year , and the primary end point was the forced vital capacity ( FVC , expressed as a percentage of the predicted value ) at 12 months , after adjustment for the baseline FVC . Of 158 patients , 145 completed at least six months of treatment and were included in the analysis . The mean absolute difference in adjusted 12-month FVC percent predicted between the cyclophosphamide and placebo groups was 2.53 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.28 to 4.79 percent ) , favoring cyclophosphamide ( P < 0.03 ) . There were also treatment-related differences in physiological and symptom outcomes , and the difference in FVC was maintained at 24 months . There was a greater frequency of adverse events in the cyclophosphamide group , but the difference between the two groups in the number of serious adverse events was not significant . One year of oral cyclophosphamide in patients with symptomatic scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease had a significant but modest beneficial effect on lung function , dyspnea , thickening of the skin , and the health-related quality of life . The effects on lung function were maintained through the 24 months of the study . Copyright 2006 Massachusetts Medical Society .\n",
