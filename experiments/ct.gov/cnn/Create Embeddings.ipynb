The strongest evidence for efficacy has come from studies using D-cycloserine at a dose of 50 mg/day added to conventional antipsychotics in trials of 8 weeks duration or less . To assess the efficacy for negative symptoms and cognitive impairment of D-cycloserine augmentation of conventional antipsychotics in a 6-month trial . Fifty-five schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms , treated with conventional antipsychotics , were randomly assigned to treatment with D-cycloserine 50 mg/day or placebo for 6 months in a double-blind , parallel group design . Twenty-six subjects completed the 6-month trial ; drop-out rates did not differ between treatment groups . D-Cycloserine treatment did not differ from placebo treatment on any primary outcome measure at 8 or 24 weeks , including response of negative symptoms and performance on a cognitive battery . Serum D-cycloserine concentrations did not correlate with response of negative symptoms . D-Cycloserine did not exhibit therapeutic effects in this trial , possibly reflecting the high drop-out rate , a narrow range of therapeutic serum concentrations , a modest magnitude of therapeutic effect for the selected outcome measures , or loss of efficacy over time . Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist with relatively low affinity for the glycine site , the magnitude of potential therapeutic effect may be smaller than that achieved by the higher-affinity full agonists , glycine and D-serine .\n",

We investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors . In this randomized study , 10,251 patients ( mean age , 62.2 years ) with a median glycated hemoglobin level of 8.1 % were assigned to receive intensive therapy ( targeting a glycated hemoglobin level below 6.0 % ) or standard therapy ( targeting a level from 7.0 to 7.9 % ) . Of these patients , 38 % were women , and 35 % had had a previous cardiovascular event . The primary outcome was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , or death from cardiovascular causes . The finding of higher mortality in the intensive-therapy group led to a discontinuation of intensive therapy after a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up . At 1 year , stable median glycated hemoglobin levels of 6.4 % and 7.5 % were achieved in the intensive-therapy group and the standard-therapy group , respectively . During follow-up , the primary outcome occurred in 352 patients in the intensive-therapy group , as compared with 371 in the standard-therapy group ( hazard ratio , 0.90 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.78 to 1.04 ; P=0.16 ) . At the same time , 257 patients in the intensive-therapy group died , as compared with 203 patients in the standard-therapy group ( hazard ratio , 1.22 ; 95 % CI , 1.01 to 1.46 ; P=0.04 ) . Hypoglycemia requiring assistance and weight gain of more than 10 kg were more frequent in the intensive-therapy group ( P < 0.001 ) . As compared with standard therapy , the use of intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels for 3.5 years increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events . These findings identify a previously unrecognized harm of intensive glucose lowering in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes .

This study administered a novel immunotherapy regimen aimed at consolidating remission in these patients . Fifty-two patients with translocation positive , recurrent , or metastatic Ewing 's sarcoma family of tumors or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma underwent prechemotherapy cell harvest via apheresis for potential receipt of immunotherapy . Following completion of standard multimodal therapy , 30 patients ultimately initiated immunotherapy and were sequentially assigned to three cohorts . All cohorts received autologous T cells , influenza vaccinations , and dendritic cells pulsed with peptides derived from tumor-specific translocation breakpoints and E7 , a peptide known to bind HLA-A2 . Cohort 1 received moderate-dose recombinant human interleukin-2 ( rhIL-2 ) , cohort 2 received low-dose rhIL-2 , and cohort 3 did not receive rhIL-2 . All immunotherapy recipients generated influenza-specific immune responses , whereas immune responses to the translocation breakpoint peptides occurred in 39 % , and only 25 % of HLA-A2 ( + ) patients developed E7-specific responses . Toxicity was minimal . Intention-to-treat analysis revealed a 31 % 5-year overall survival for all patients apheresed ( median potential follow-up 7.3 years ) with a 43 % 5-year overall survival for patients initiating immunotherapy . Consolidative immunotherapy is a scientifically based and clinically practical approach for integrating immunotherapy into a multimodal regimen for chemoresponsive cancer . Patients receiving immunotherapy experienced minimal toxicity and favorable survival . The robust influenza immune responses observed suggest that postchemotherapy immune incompetence will not fundamentally limit this approach . Future studies will seek to increase efficacy by using more immunogenic antigens and more potent dendritic cells .\n",

The psychiatrist has a limited evidence base to guide treatment , particularly as there are no trials in children comparing atypical antipsychotics , the mainstay of current treatment . To compare the efficacy and safety of olanzapine and clozapine , hypothesizing that clozapine would be more efficacious . Double-blind randomized 8-week controlled trial , with a 2-year open-label follow-up . National Institute of Mental Health study , January 1998 to June 2005 . Patients underwent reassessment 2 years after discharge . Children and adolescents recruited nationally , aged 7 to 16 years , meeting unmodified DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia , and resistant to treatment with at least 2 antipsychotics . After drug washout and a 1- to 3-week antipsychotic-free period , patients were randomized to treatment with clozapine ( n = 12 ) or olanzapine ( n = 13 ) . The Clinical Global Impression Severity of Symptoms Scale and Schedule for the Assessment of Negative/Positive Symptoms . Clozapine was associated with a significant reduction in all outcome measures , whereas olanzapine showed a less consistent profile of clinical improvement . While there were moderate to large differential treatment effects in favor of clozapine , these reached significance only in the alleviation of negative symptoms from an antipsychotic-free baseline ( P = .04 ; effect size , 0.89 ) . Clozapine was associated with more overall adverse events . At 2-year follow-up , 15 patients were receiving clozapine with evidence of sustained clinical improvement , but additional adverse events emerged , including lipid anomalies ( n = 6 ) and seizures ( n = 1 ) . While not demonstrating definitively the superiority of clozapine compared with olanzapine in treatment-refractory childhood-onset schizophrenia , the study suggests that clozapine has a more favorable profile of clinical response , which is balanced against more associated adverse events .\n",

Twenty obese adolescents with obesity-related co-morbid conditions underwent measurements of body composition , glucose homeostasis by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FSIGT ) , and fasting lipids before and after 6 months treatment with orlistat 120 mg tid in conjunction with a comprehensive behavioral program . Weight ( p < 0.05 ) , BMI ( p < 0.001 ) , total cholesterol ( p < 0.001 ) , LDL cholesterol ( p < 0.001 ) , fasting insulin ( p < 0.02 ) and fasting glucose ( p < 0.003 ) were lower after treatment . Insulin sensitivity , measured during the FSIGT , improved significantly ( p < 0.02 ) , as did fasting indices such as the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance ( p < 0.01 ) . African American subjects exhibited significantly less improvement in weight ( p < 0.05 ) , BMI ( p < 0.01 ) , waist circumference ( p = 0.03 ) , and insulin sensitivity ( p = 0.05 ) . Improvements in cholesterol were not significantly different between African Americans and Caucasians . We conclude that Caucasians lost more weight and had greater improvements in insulin sensitivity than African Americans , but both exhibited improvements in plasma lipids . The true benefit of orlistat treatment over a comprehensive behavioral program remains to be determined in placebo-controlled trials .\n",

Twenty-six patients with advanced melanoma were randomly assigned to vaccination with a mixture of four gp100 and tyrosinase peptides restricted by HLA-A1 , HLA-A2 , and HLA-A3 , plus a tetanus helper peptide , either in an emulsion with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) and Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant ( Seppic Inc , Fairfield , NJ ) , or pulsed on monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( DCs ) . Systemic low-dose interleukin-2 ( Chiron , Emeryville , CA ) was given to both groups . T-lymphocyte responses were assessed , by interferon gamma ELIspot assay ( Chiron , Emeryville , CA ) , in peripheral-blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) and in a lymph node draining a vaccine site ( sentinel immunized node [ SIN ] ) . In patients vaccinated with GM-CSF in adjuvant , T-cell responses to melanoma peptides were observed in 42 % of PBLs and 80 % of SINs , but in patients vaccinated with DCs , they were observed in only 11 % and 13 % , respectively . The overall immune response was greater in the GM-CSF arm ( P < .02 ) . Vitiligo developed in two of 13 patients in the GM-CSF arm but in no patients in the DC arm . Helper T-cell responses to the tetanus peptide were detected in PBLs after vaccination and correlated with T-cell reactivity to the melanoma peptides . Objective clinical responses were observed in two patients in the GM-CSF arm and one patient in the DC arm . Stable disease was observed in two patients in the GM-CSF arm and one patient in the DC arm . The high frequency of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses and the occurrence of clinical tumor regressions support continued investigation of multipeptide vaccines administered with GM-CSF in adjuvant .\n",

The vaccines were administered s.c. in either of two adjuvants , Montanide ISA-51 or QS-21 , to 22 patients with high-risk resected melanoma ( stage IIB-IV ) . Local and systemic toxicities were mild and transient . We detected CTL responses to the gp100 ( 280 ) peptide in peripheral blood in 14 % of patients . Helper T-cell responses to the tetanus helper peptide were detected in 79 % of patients and had a Th1 cytokine profile . One patient with a CTL response to gp100 had a recurrence in a lymph node 2 years later ; her nodes contained CD8+ cells reactive to gp100 ( 280 ) ( 0.24 % ) , which proliferated in response to peptide . The overall survival of patients is 75 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 57-94 % ) at 4.7 years follow-up , which compares favorably with expected survival . Four of 14 patients who completed at least six vaccines subsequently developed metastases , all of which were solitary and surgically resectable . They remain alive and clinically free of disease at last follow-up . Data from this trial demonstrate immunogenicity of the gp100 ( 280 ) peptide and suggest that immune responses may persist long-term in some patients . The frequency and magnitude of the CTL response may be improved with more aggressive vaccination regimens . Although this Phase I study was not intended to evaluate clinical benefit , the excellent survival of patients on this protocol suggests the possibility of a benefit that should be assessed in future studies .\n",

Patients with carcinoma of the cervix and histologically documented para-aortic node metastases were eligible for this phase I/II trial . Chemotherapy agents were administered weekly concurrent with extended field radiation with escalating doses of paclitaxel from 30-50 mg/m ( 2 ) in each of three cohorts of three patients each . A phase II cohort was then evaluated at the selected maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) . The MTD was determined to be cisplatin 40 mg/m ( 2 ) ( maximum dose of 70 mg ) and paclitaxel 40 mg/m ( 2 ) administered weekly for six cycles concurrent with extended field radiation therapy . There were 19 evaluable patients for the phase II analysis of toxicity and efficacy . Grade three and four gastrointestinal toxicity was seen in 6 and neutropenia in 7 . Radiation therapy was successfully completed in 36.8 % of patients at eight weeks and in 68.4 % of patients at nine weeks , with a median time to completion was 56 days . A total of 27 evaluable patients were enrolled , twelve are dead ( mean survival of those deceased is 25 months ) , and 15 ( 56 % ) are alive , and have been followed for a mean of 48 months ( range 25-68 ; median of 46 months ) . Paclitaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy concurrent with extended field pelvic para-aortic irradiation can be administered at the described MTD and shows a higher than previously reported disease-free survival in relation to historical data . The 56 % survival to date , and 50 % estimated 48 month survival , warrants validation in a larger prospective cohort . Central radiation dose reduction is being considered in the next trial to decrease late toxicity of regimen .\n",

Preliminary to the trial outcome analysis , we examined the incidence of amenorrhea and its relationship to symptoms and quality of life ( QOL ) in the standard-care arm of this adjuvant breast cancer trial . Premenopausal women treated on the doxorubicin-and-cyclophosphamide-followed-by-docetaxel arm were included . Questionnaires assessing menstrual history , QOL , and symptoms were administered at baseline , day 1 of cycle 4 ( or 9 weeks from start of chemotherapy for those who stopped chemotherapy early ) , and at 6 , 12 , and 24 months . Seven hundred and eight patients were evaluable for the analysis , with median potential follow-up of 57.5 months . Of these , 321 patients also participated in the QOL substudy . Of the 708 patients , 83 % reported > or =1 episode of amenorrhea for > or =6 months . The estimated rate of resumption of menses at 24 months was 45.3 % for women < 40 years , 10.9 % for women 40-50 , and 3.2 % for women > 50 years . Those treated with tamoxifen were more likely to become amenorrheic ( p = 0.003 ) . Menstrual status was not significantly associated with QOL or symptoms . Prolonged amenorrhea is associated with a regimen that contains doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , and docetaxel , and is age dependent and impacted by tamoxifen use . Vasomotor symptoms are common in this patient population but are not associated with menstrual status . These results can be used to inform premenopausal women about the risk and time course of amenorrhea associated with this common adjuvant therapy regimen , along with the effects on symptoms and QOL .\n",

A multi-center phase 2 trial was conducted that added intravenous pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( day 8 ; 30-40 mg/m ( 2 ) ) to a regimen of intraperitoneal cisplatin ( day 2 ; 75 mg/m ( 2 ) ) and intravenous ( day 1 ; 135 mg/m ( 2 ) ) plus intraperitoneal ( day 8 ; 60 mg/m ( 2 ) ) paclitaxel . Treatment was initially delivered on an every 3-week schedule , but was modified to an every 4-week program due to excessive toxicity . Patients were to receive 6 cycles of this regimen . Of 68 patients entering this trial , 63 patients were eligible and evaluable , of whom 39 ( 62 % ) completed 6 cycles . Overall , 32 ( 51 % ) experienced at least 1 grade 4 or worse toxicity ( most commonly hematologic ) including 5 treatment-related deaths . Median progression-free survival ( PFS ) was 25 months ( 2-year PFS : 52 % ) and median overall survival 51 months , an outcome similar to previous reports of cisplatin-based intraperitoneal chemotherapy in comparable patient populations . Seventeen patients ( 27 % of all eligible patients ) were without evidence of disease recurrence > 4 years following entry into the trial . Both the overall trial outcome , and specifically the excessively severe systemic toxicity of this regimen would prevent its future development in this exact form . The provocative PFS in a subset of individuals should encourage the development of alternative strategies designed to optimize the delivery of regional therapy in ovarian cancer management .\n",
