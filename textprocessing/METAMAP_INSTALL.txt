METAMAP INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=================================

By default this code works with Metamap 2014 (probably does work but untested with the newer versions). 

This also requires the installation of specific additional vocabularies. This is since other systematic review automation projects are using SNOMED CT, MeSH, RxNorm, and ATC. 

These instructions should work for Mac and Linux. They have not been tested in Windows, but the differences needed for Windows are described in the links below.

1. Download the 2014 version of metamap from [the NIH site](https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/MainDownload.shtml) -- you will require to register
2. Install metamap following [these instructions](https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/Installation.shtml)
3. Visit [the additional vocabularies download page](https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/DataSetDownload.shtml) 
4. Download the following files:
    - 2015 Specialist Lexicon
    - Under '2015AB UMLS **NLM** Datasets' (make sure not *base* or *USAbase*)
        + 2015AB Common Data 
        + 2015AB Relaxed Model Data
5. Install the new datasets following [these instructions](https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/Docs/public_mm_additional_models.shtml). In brief, it involves untar.gz ing the files and placing them in the appropriate subdirectory of your metamap installation.
