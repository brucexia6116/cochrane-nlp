novo nordisk, bagsv\u00e6rd, denmark) or insulin glargine (lantus; sanofi-aventis, paris, france) as add-on therapy to oral glucose-lowering drugs. the trial was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and principles for good clinical practice and was approved by ethics committees/review boards in all countries. all participants gave written informed consent. concealed randomisation was carried out by an automatic telephone response system and was stratified according to oral glucose-lowering drug mono- or combination-therapy at entry. an open-label design was required to allow twice daily administration of insulin detemir if needed, according to the dosing algorithm targets for pre-dinner plasma glucose (pg) concentrations (table 1). glargine was only administered once daily at bedtime as per study protocol and in accordance with its licence [18]. to reduce potential bias, hba1c results were only disclosed to investigators at randomisation and at trial end. participants insulin-naive men and women with type 2 diabetes and the following characteristics were recruited: \u226518 years old, \u226512 months disease duration, bmi\u2264 40.0 kg/m2 and hba1c 7.5\u201310.0%. for inclusion, they had to be receiving one or two oral agents (metformin, insulin secretagogues, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors) \u22654 months on at least one-half the maximum recommended dose, according to local guidelines. exclusion criteria included treatment with thiazolidinediones (due to labelling restrictions in europe), use of more than two oral agents within 6 months, hypoglycaemic unawareness or other medical conditions likely to interfere with trial conduct. withdrawal criteria included pregnancy, hba1c >11.0% after the first 12 weeks of treatment and initiation of medication interfering with glucose metabolism. study medications oral glucose-lowering therapy, diet and physical activity were recommended to remain stable during the study; no meal-time insulin was allowed. basal insulin was initiated once daily in the evening at a dose of  \f",

abbott, wiesbaden, germany). dose adjustments were to be based on the average of three selfmeasurements before breakfast (and before dinner if on twice daily insulin detemir). during the first 12 weeks, participants had weekly investigator contact. a titration committee monitored the algorithm for insulin dose optimisation and reviewed prescribed insulin doses periodically. this committee was not informed of the treatment insulin being used, but this would have been evident for participants on twice daily insulin detemir. outcome measures the primary endpoint was baselineadjusted hba1c at end of treatment. secondary variables included clinic fpg, within-participant variation in pg, tenpoint self-measured pg profiles, proportion of participants achieving hba1c \u22647.0% with and without hypoglycaemia, change in body weight, incidence of hypoglycaemia, adverse events and standard safety parameters. analyses and assessments hba1c was analysed by hplc (bio rad, munich, germany [eu analyses] and bio rad, hercules, ca, usa [us analyses], dcct-harmonised), with a reference range 4.3\u20136.1%. clinic fpg was measured centrally by a hexokinase method (gluco-quant; roche, mannheim, germany). body weight was measured using calibrated scales. participants recorded ten-point pg profiles during the last week of treatment. hypoglycaemia was classified as \u2018major\u2019 if assistance from another person was required, \u2018minor\u2019 if confirmed by pg<3.1 mmol/l or \u2018symptoms only\u2019 if pg\u22653.1 mmol/l or no measurement was made. statistical analyses the sample size was based on noninferiority of insulin detemir relative to insulin glargine for hba1c after 52 weeks. to achieve a power of 95% with an expected sd for change in hba1c of 1.1% and allowing a dropout rate of 15%, it was originally planned to randomise 466 patients. however, this was extended to 566 patients to allow for potential regional differences between the eu and us. the possibility of a treatment \u00d7 region interaction was tested, but eliminated from the model as no significant interaction was found. non-inferiority was accepted if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% ci for the difference in hba1c (detemir\u2013glargine) was less than 0.4%-units, a value decided in discussion with the food and drug administration (fda) for the entire insulin detemir phase iii study programme. unless otherwise specified, all analyses were based on the intention-to-treat (itt) population, this being all randomised patients exposed to insulin detemir or insulin glargine. a significance level of 5% was used for all analyses. participants were regarded as being on once- or  \f",

results are given for observational comparison only. analyses of hba1c, clinic fpg and change in weight after 52 weeks were by anova with treatment, region and oral glucose-lowering therapy as fixed effects and baseline (randomisation) value as covariate. the last observation carried forward (locf) principle was specified for hba1c and clinic fpg in non-completers treated \u226512 weeks (time of the first on-treatment measurements). change in weight was estimated based on all participants completing the trial. additional weight analyses were prepared for the itt population, applying the same locf principle or using imputed data, by treatment-specific linear regression, from week 12 onwards to account for continuing weight change and limit the influence of differences in withdrawal rates and times between treatments. fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare the numbers of patients on insulin detemir and insulin glargine with an hba1c \u22647.0% without symptomatic hypoglycaemia confirmed by pg <4.0 mmol/l or any single value <3.1 mmol/l during the last 3 months of treatment. the ten-point self-monitored pg profiles were analysed for parallelism using repeated measures anova depending on treatment, region, oral glucose-lowering therapy, time and treatment \u00d7 time interaction as fixed effects. withinparticipant variation in self-measured fasting and pre-dinner pg was determined from four measurements for each during the last week of treatment. hypoglycaemic episodes during the 52 week treatment period were analysed as recurrent events in a cox regression analysis using a gamma frailty model (splus 2000; insightful, seattle, wa, usa). nocturnal episodes (2300 to 0600 hours) were analysed separately. adverse events were summarised using descriptive statistics. all other analyses were performed using sas version 8.2 (sas institute, cary, nc, usa).  results participants of 892 patients screened, 582 were randomised, while 289 did not fulfil the selection criteria and 21 withdrew consent. in each treatment arm, 291 patients were randomised and treated, of whom 231 (79%) and 252 (87%) completed the trial on insulin detemir and insulin glargine, respectively (fig. 1). the higher withdrawal rate observed with insulin detemir was partly due to adverse events, ten of which were considered possibly or probably related to trial drug (electronic supplementary material [esm] table 1). these included two cases of possible cutaneous allergy, five of injection site reactions and one each of injection site inflammation, hypoglycaemia and  411  weight increase. adverse event withdrawals with possible or probable relation to glargine included one case each of pruritus, myalgia, hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. details of all adverse events leading to withdrawal are provided in esm table 2. other diabetes-related reasons for withdrawal with insulin detemir included hba1c 12.0% (n=1) and multiple hypoglycaemic episodes (n=1). other reasons for withdrawal included the closure of a trial site and various circumstantial events unrelated to the trial medications. baseline characteristics (table 2) were comparable between the two treatment groups. participants completing the trial on once or twice daily insulin detemir had a baseline hba1c of 8.60 and 8.66%, respectively. insulin dosing of participants treated with insulin detemir, 104 (45%) completed the trial on one daily injection, while 129 (55%) administered an additional morning dose. the majority of patients administering insulin detemir twice daily (n=103) were transferred to this regimen within 12 weeks of treatment. at the time of transfer, about twothirds of the patients adding a morning injection fulfilled the formal dose transfer guidelines, the other one-third were changed through investigator discretion. participants using insulin detemir twice daily administered about 40% of their daily insulin dose before breakfast. after 52 weeks the mean daily dose of insulin detemir (n=227) was 0.78 u/kg (0.52 u/kg on once daily [n=102] and 1.00 u/kg on twice daily [n=125]) and the mean daily dose of glargine (n= 248) was 0.44 iu/kg. glycaemic control hba1c decreased by 1.5% with both insulins and was comparable after 52 weeks at 7.2% (n= 268) and 7.1% (n=275) for detemir and glargine respectively (table 3), with an estimated difference of 0.05 (\u22120.11, 0.21)%, thereby meeting the criteria for non-inferiority for insulin detemir vs glargine. hba1c was similar in participants completing the study on once or twice daily insulin detemir (7.1 and 7.1%). clinic fpg was 10.8 mmol/l at baseline in both arms and was comparable at end of treatment with insulin detemir and insulin glargine (7.1 and 7.0 mmol/l) (table 3). the profile of change in hba1c and fpg was very similar (fig. 2a). mean self-monitored fpg was comparable between treatments, being 6.1 mmol/l with insulin detemir and 6.0 mmol/l with insulin glargine; self-monitored pg predinner (6.8 and 7.0 mmol/l) was also similar. within-participant variation in self-monitored pg prebreakfast and pre-dinner did not differ significantly between insulin detemir and insulin glargine (table 3). the overall shape of the ten-point self-monitored pg profiles during the last week of treatment was parallel for insulin detemir (n=218) and insulin glargine (n=246) (ns) and appeared identical, regardless of treatment regimen (fig. 2b).  \f",

        "diabetologia (2008) 51:408\u2013416  the present study was designed to compare the two basal insulin analogues as they had been used in previous studies and according to label. thus, insulin glargine was given once daily at bedtime regardless of glycaemic profile, while for insulin detemir an option was provided for adding a second dose, primarily based on pre-dinner blood glucose level following a structured insulin titration protocol. the decision to use twice-daily insulin detemir could not be attributed to hypoglycaemia, as patients who were switched to a twice-daily regimen had on average 3.7 hypoglycaemic episodes per patient-year prior to transfer, compared with 4.7 episodes per patient-year in patients completing treatment on once-daily insulin detemir. the frequency of nocturnal hypoglycaemia was also lower in relevant patients before transfer (0.7 vs 0.9 episodes per patient-year). interestingly, the initiation of insulin with once-daily insulin detemir has recently been tested by philis-tsimikas et al. in type 2 diabetes patients on oral glucose-lowering agents, resulting in hba1c reductions of 1.5% (morning injection) and 1.6% (evening injection) from baseline values of 9.1 and 8.9%, respectively [13]. these improvements in glycaemic control approach the magnitude of hba1c reduction shown in the current study and in previous studies of once-daily insulin glargine [9\u201311], although the insulin detemir doses were higher at trial-end and the absolute hba1c values achieved at trial-end were relatively high. the design of the current study does not allow definitive conclusions for comparison of once and twice daily dosing with insulin detemir, although these post hoc observations do suggest that once daily administration can be an appropriate starting regimen for people using insulin detemir as add-on to oral glucose-lowering drug therapy. however, with dose optimisation, a significant proportion of patients may eventually need a twice-daily regimen, guided by structured glucose monitoring. further studies are required to better define the differences between these two basal insulin analogues on the basis of a similar insulin administration regimen, once daily only, for both insulins. alternatively, if the option of adding a second insulin dose is available for both insulins, then a properly designed study protocol should allow addition of this second insulin injection only when a normal or much lower fpg target is achieved. indeed, the use of lower fpg targets (e.g. \u22645.5 mmol/l, as has been used previously) should also enable a higher proportion of patients to reach guideline hba1c targets. in conclusion, the use of insulin detemir or insulin glargine as add-on to oral glucose-lowering therapy resulted in comparable hba1c improvements and a similarly low risk of hypoglycaemia. further comparisons of detemir and glargine are required to fully understand how each may relatively benefit defined groups of patients starting on insulin.  415 acknowledgements the investigators and participants are thanked for their participation. a full list of investigators can be seen in the
